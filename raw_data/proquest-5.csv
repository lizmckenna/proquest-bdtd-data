From a detailed examination of Marx's writings it will be seen that proceeding from the standpoint of Young Hegelian Idealism, Marx came partly from his reading but more importantly from his involvement with `lq material interests (I), begun as editor of the Rheinische Zeitung of 1842-3, to an analysis of the modern individualistic and competitive system of industrial capitalism, and further from his experience of the Parisian working-class and the revolt of the Silesian weavers in 1844 to the conclusion that the industrial proletariat had the potential to overthrow this system and replace it with a harmonious, co-operative society with neither private property, social classes nor state. In examining too, the ideas and strategies of other revolutionary thinkers the specific features of Marx's revolutionary concept will be brought into sharper focus- in particular its fundamentally democratic character. In this respect it will be seen that the crucial watch-word formulated by Marx for The International Working Men's Association in 1871 that `lq the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves (2) can well serve as the leit-motiv of Marx's entire revolutionary career, and that this watch-word is directly linked to the theoretical conclusions of both The German Ideology and The Theses on Feuerbach in 1845-6, that equal weight must be given to `lq men and `lq circumstances in the making of history and that `lq the coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionising practice .

Conflicting pressures toward respectability and radicalism repeatedly tested the Society's loyalties to the Imperial nation and to its heritage of Dissent. It is in this period of what came to be known as the 'Quaker Renaissance' that I have located the emergence of what I call 'Friendly patriotism' - a complex set of attitudes by which public - spirited Quakers attempted to straddle multiple identities. Radical Dissenter and Evangelical Nonconformist; Christian Prophet and Subject of Empire - the 'Friendly patriot' of the period struggled to be true to sometimes wildly divergent traditions and impulses in his desire to embody an ideal of 'Christian citizenship'. No longer a 'Peculiar People', no longer relegated to a social or economic periphery, Quakers had been self-consciously integrating themselves into the mainstream of British life with enviable speed and success. At the close of the nineteenth century, the Society of Friends developed an acute sense of a special Quaker mission to improve the public culture of the day. What were perceived as the Society's unique spiritual and ethical testimonies were to become the essential ingredients of a national and international regeneration. The health of the Emprie rested, in part, with the capacity of civic-minded Friends to commit themselves to its care. Quakerism began to view itself not simply as being integrated into British public life, but integral to its further development. The welfare of the State became intimately linked to the effectiveness of Quaker participation in its political institutions. In this thesis, I have chosen to focus upon three of the most vivid expressions of the social and poltiical feeling within the Society of Friends which I have called 'Friendly patriotism'. The Quaker response to the Nonconformist campaign against the 1902 Education Act, the Quaker approach to international relations within the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European peace movement, and the Quaker crusade on behalf of Anglo-German friendship before the First World War revealed the Society's eagerness to interpret and re-interpret its extraordinary heritage of pacificsm and social responsibility in the light of the requirements of the new century. The outward turning of the Evangelical spirit, the firm conviction of Quakerism's unique message for both the churches and the governments of the world, and the profund belief in the Society of Friends' responsibility for the spiritual well-being of the Empire are reflected in each of these dimensions of the Society's life during the period. This work attempts to lift Quaker historiography out of the inevitable parochialism of 'in-house' denominational scholarship in which it has long been mired, and place a critical moment in the history of the Society of Friends within the context of a broader intellectual and cultural framework.",301520213,,Dissertations & Theses," Phillips, Brian DavidPhillipsDavidBrianPhillips, Brian David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1752114211 , 44183991 , 101309 , U017127 , U017127", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301520213?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU017127 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Friendly+patriotism%3A+british+quakerism+and+the+imperial+nation%2C+1890-1910&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Phillips%2C+Brian+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3386,History of the Panamanian novel,"Despite the ever-increasing attention given to the Spanish American novel, the novelistic traditions of some Spanish-speaking countries remain undocumented. One nation whose writers have been ignored by the international critical community is the Republic of Panama. Although Panama has produced many excellent novelists, isthmian authors continue to be relegated to marginal status. The reasons for this have less to do with the question of intrinsic worth than with other factors, such as limited access to mass audiences and the absence of a viable publishing industry. This dissertation presents a comprehensive historical survey of the Panamanian novel, and demonstrates that isthmian writers merit more consideration than they have heretofore received. The study begins with an overview of Panamanian history, in order to show the economic, social and political forces that have shaped isthmian culture. Then, the beginnings of the Spanish American novel are outlined in order to establish the context that gave rise to the first novelistic efforts--from 1849 to 1903--by Panamanian writers. From the 1920's onward, the Panamanian novelistic tradition began to gain momentum, initially serving as an expression of Modernism, but soon evolving (in the 1930's) into a vehicle for Criollist-oriented works predominantly imbued with Realist and Neo-Romantic elements. It will be demonstrated that Panama's regionalist movement, which maintained its vitality until the 1960's, possesses a rich thematic diversity, and is worthy of study not only for aesthetic reasons, but for its insights about the isthmus and its people. Panamanian Criollism explores rural and urban themes from a wide variety of perspectives, features historical novels depicting significant events in the country's past, and examines the impact of the Panama Canal on the nation via the ""novela canalera."" In the last several decades Panamanian novelists, while continuing to portray isthmian reality, have also embraced the cosmopolitan outlook and stylistic innovations associated with the more renowned exponents of contemporary Spanish American fiction. It will be shown that, like the Modernist and Criollist writers of previous generations, current Panamanian authors have also been denied the recognition due them, for their contributions have been substantial.",303670253,,Dissertations & Theses," Lindenau, Donald ClarkLindenauClarkDonaldLindenau, Donald Clark", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747108681 , 28065201 , 66569 , 9028929 , 9028929", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303670253?accountid=14496, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature,, 0312 Latin American literature, Latin American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Criollism , Modernism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=History+of+the+Panamanian+novel&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lindenau%2C+Donald+Clark&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3387,"Visions and revisions of the American landscape: Paintings and photographs of the Stieglitz Circle, 1924-1934","It is commonplace, in art historical parlance, to cite photographer Alfred Stieglitz' New York gallery, ""291"", as the channel through which the most innovative European modes of representation were received in the United States in the years of the gallery's existence: 1905-1917. Emphasis has been placed on Stieglitz' role as the American importer and promoter of significant modern European masters. But Stieglitz played another, equally important, role during the ""291"" years, and even more prominently through his engagement with the Intimate Gallery (1925-29) and An American Place (1929-46), two later galleries which are the focus of this dissertation. It was these later ""salons"" that saw his most avid promotion of the American artists: Demuth, Dove, Hartley, Marin, O'Keefe and Strand, who became known as the ""Stieglitz Circle"". In fact, after the closing down of ""291"" in 1917, Stieglitz chose to exhibit, exclusively, the work of American artists. In addition to revising the misleading identification of Alfred Stieglitz exclusively with ""291"" ideals and accomplishments, this paper also seeks to correct the familiar assumption that it was not until the forties that a native art, international in ambitions, was created in America. Rather, in the decades following the First World War, the painters and photographers of the Stieglitz group invented unique idioms of pictorial representation which would eloquently and effectively express to a receptive, international public a specifically American aesthetic and social philosophy. The modes of representation they coined were propagated and legitimized by an on-going series of gallery exhibitions orchestrated by Stieglitz and supported by the coterie of artistic and cultural critics who comprised the inner circle. Indeed, during the post-war period, artists of the Stieglitz group introduced into the arena of image-making innovative landscape modes--as ambitious as those of any contemporary American or European movement--with which they both defined and celebrated their native land. Depictions of the American land became their forte, indeed their obsession. The specific nature and complex meanings of their urban and rural landscape images are analyzed in my paper.",303679046,,Dissertations & Theses," Connor, CelesteConnorCelesteConnor, Celeste", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745018111 , 28054841 , 66569 , 9006288 , 9006288", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303679046?accountid=14496," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies",," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies"," Fine Arts , American studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Demuth , Dove , Hartley , Marin , O'Keeffe , Strand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visions+and+revisions+of+the+American+landscape%3A+Paintings+and+photographs+of+the+Stieglitz+Circle%2C+1924-1934&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Connor%2C+Celeste&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3388,"Women's campaigns against West German rearmament, 1949-1955","This dissertation addresses the issue of West German rearmament and the widespread opposition to it between 1949 and 1955. The study examines women's involvements in the campaign against German remilitarization in particular since the percentage of women opposed to rearmament was considerably higher than that of men. Specifically, the dissertation focuses on two women's peace organizations during the Adenauer era: the German Section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), officially reestablished in 1949, and the West German Women's Peace Movement (WFFB), founded in 1952. The case-studies of the two women's organizations describe the difficulties and problems of non-parliamentary opposition groups in general and women's groups in particular. Problems addressed will include the women's motives for their involvement, their self-awareness, political activities, channels of communication, as well as their reaction to governmental accusations of being Communists. The study concludes with an analysis of the achievements and the set-backs of the women activists. In addition to examining internal reasons for the women's successes and failures, the study deals with the socio-political and economic conditions which prevailed during the period under consideration. In illuminating the responses of the Adenauer government toward the peace protesters, the study goes beyond being a description of women's peace activities. Rather, it analyzes the women's motives, goals, and programs in the context of postwar German social and political realities. Though the women failed to achieve their major goal of keeping the Federal Republic of Germany disarmed, they succeeded in setting examples and living lives which conformed to their political beliefs. The active women proved that powerful personal war and postwar experiences could help to overcome political apathy and transform many past fears of political action into energy for political action. In ""daring more democracy"" themselves, the activists contributed to a broader participation in the democratic process. Thus, these activists and their successors became a force in society.",303693379,,Dissertations & Theses," Meyer, Helga AnnaMeyerAnnaHelgaMeyer, Helga Anna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 743974631 , 26537511 , 66569 , 8923514 , 8923514", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303693379?accountid=14496," 0509 Economic history , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0509 Economic history , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0509 Economic history , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0509 Economic history , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," Economic history , European history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Germany",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women%27s+campaigns+against+West+German+rearmament%2C+1949-1955&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meyer%2C+Helga+Anna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3389,Jewish emigres and popular images of Jews in Japan,"This study explores the movement of people and ideas across national borders. Analysis, based upon interviews and examination of popular texts, focuses on individuals whose relocation is a result of dislocation, and on stereotypes fashioned in one culture and exploited and transformed in another. Interviews were conducted 1984-86 in Tokyo, Yokohama and Kobe with Jewish emigres whose presence in Japan is related to political events dating from the 1920's that blocked their lands of origin as places of residence or points of return. Representations of Jews in Japanese popular texts were culled from sources, including magazines, newspapers, novels and bestsellers, school textbooks, drama, television and comics, that span the period from the introduction of Western literature in Japan in the late 19th century to the 1980's. The Jew of popular Japanese literature is highly articulated, endowed with qualities that reveal ample evidence of a variety of absorbed Western ideas on Jews and a full palette of anti-Semitic stereotypes inspired by ""The Merchant of Venice"" and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, as well as sympathetic renderings of Jewish diaspora and the Holocaust. It remains a mental universe, however, virtually unknown to most of the Jewish emigres in Japan, much less thought to be a matter of concern capable of affecting their action in Japan where Jewish cultural markers remain non-salient and operationally invisible. The Jewish emigres exist in Japan as Western foreigners who have occupied a rather privileged but politically powerless position, substantially different from that of Asians and minorities in Japan. The Japanese portrayal of Jews represents a metaphor of the West, and is deeply embedded in a search to define Japanese national identity and Japan's place in the world. The dissertation address the issue of statelessness, the idea of incorporation in a social arena that stresses homogeneity, and the problem of identity formation. It is argued that both the Jewish emigre in Japan and the Japanese construct of a Jewish stereotype are to be understood in the context of global historical, political and economic forces that determined their entry and operation in Japan.",303697946,,Dissertations & Theses," Silverman, Cheryl A.SilvermanA.CherylSilverman, Cheryl A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747131271 , 28052391 , 66569 , 9127974 , 9127974", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303697946?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0305 Asian literature"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0305 Asian literature"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0305 Asian literature",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0305 Asian literature"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Cultural anthropology , Asian literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jewish+emigres+and+popular+images+of+Jews+in+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Silverman%2C+Cheryl+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3390,Such a contracted sphere: Some aspects of the writing of Australian history prior to 1900,"Students of Australians historiography generally fail to connect what has been written in the Twentieth Century with what came before. This thesis attempts to fill some part of this gap in Australian historiography by looking at the way in which some claimants to the name 'Australian' reconstructed the past during the Nineteenth Century. In particular, it demonstrates the development of traditions in, of influences on, and versions of, the interpretation of Australian history in the works of four Australian 'historians': William Charles Wentworth, John Dunmore Lang, John West, and George William Rusden. Wentworth's A Statistical, Historical and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales..., is shown to arise out of the classical, legal and political sources of the time, and to affect future writing on the past by the establishment of a model of historiography. West's History of Tasmania is the first full-blown work of history on the colonial scene. As such, his history can be seen as one of the first links in the Liberal historiographical section which was to develop so strongly in the Twentieth Century, and is linked to some of the social movements that formed the 'liberal' politics of mid-Nineteenth Century Australia. In contrast, G. W. Rusden's History of Australia demonstrates both terminating and continuing strands in Australian historiography. His imperialist, romantic and commemorative historiography was part of the scene that the increasingly professionalised craft in Australia rejected, and yet, as the standard library work of the day, he was an important transmitter of developing historiographical mythologies still traceable today in the works of historians. The argument of this thesis is that there was a colonial historiography in Australia identifiable by its political usages and liberal-conservative preconceptions, that this historiography developed from and in competition with other literary forms and under the impact of international models, and that it laid the basis for the twentieth century studies in Australian history.",303746272,,Dissertations & Theses," Hutchinson, MarkHutchinsonMarkHutchinson, Mark", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744817331 , 28061701 , 66569 , 0569389 , 0569389", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303746272?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Such+a+contracted+sphere%3A+Some+aspects+of+the+writing+of+Australian+history+prior+to+1900&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hutchinson%2C+Mark&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3391,Local knowledge and the politics of world order: Interpretation and international relations,"This dissertation is an exploration of the manner in which western cultures, and especially liberal American world order studies, has constituted normative discussions of world politics. By beginning with the assumption that all such discussions imply rather broad cultural interpretations, the object of the study is initially to reveal the implicit cultural biases in past western efforts to construct a normative vision of world politics. Beginning with the emergence of the law of nations in Grotius, Pufendorf and Wolff, through the enlightenment search for peace through international organization that found its clearest spokesperson in Kant and into the contemporary intellectual world order movement that includes Falk, Galtung and a host of others, it is the western conceived notion of the social contract with underlies all western thought on world politics and, in the opinion of this dissertation, leads it astray from being able to accomplish the normative goals espoused. To work toward correcting this situation ideas are then presented which might lead toward the purposeful inclusion of cultural interpretations into the study of world politics. This would make world order studies a near relative of contemporary interpretive anthropology especially in the re-evaluation of the importance of local knowledges. This reconstructive effort includes both an exploration of the times and types of historical re-interpretation of politically significant events/periods that will be required to create an interpretive world politics and a tentative exploration of the manner in which future world politics can be discussed from within the western cultures. The emphasis here is placed on an ""ethic of toleration.""

Specifically, it seeks to monitor the evolution of the state's role in socioeconomic management by examining the changes in the overall state-society relations. Two specific issues--the consumer protection movement and the breakthrough in trade opportunity with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe--are analyzed in detail. They are intended to illustrate how an increasingly assertive, self-confident private sector has demanded greater participation in policy-making and, thus, more control of their own destiny. Despite a more aggressive private sector and recent measures to relax the once authoritarian control of the government, prospects for multi-party, pluralist democracy in Taiwan remain distant. Primarily because of (1) the Confucian cultural traditions, (2) Taiwan's peculiar international status, and (3) Taiwan's delicate relations with the PRC government on the mainland, a political system characterized by open confrontation and multi-party competition seems highly uninviting. It is in this respect that Bureaucratic-Authoritarian Pluralism (BAP), not pluralist democracy, will likely characterize the new type of state-society relations. Following martial law, civil liberty in Taiwan has been expanded appreciably. In spite of the relaxation of control, there are specific boundaries, as manifested in the newly-enacted National Security Law, which no one should violate. Therefore, in this ""restricted"" type of pluralism, dissenting views are permitted but not conciliated; and ""deviated"" behaviors are tolerated but not placated. The government still retains extensive control of social groups' behaviors and activities, particularly on some politically ""sensitive"" matters; and it reserves the right to discipline, or outright disband, groups that violate stipulated rules and regulations.

(Volumes I and II),"The internal and external dimensions of the Portuguese revolution provide a case study of the dynamics of regime transformation. Portugal, the oldest authoritarian regime in Europe, was transformed via a coup by junior military officers, whose role had previously been to maintain the regime. The Portuguese military is an interesting case study in regime transformation. It was the military that transformed the First Republic into the Estado Novo and that transformed the authoritarian regime into a democracy. The Portuguese transformation from authoritarianism to democracy was linked to the increasing alienation within the armed forces due to the colonial wars. The young officers of the Movement of the Armed Forces initiated the transformation with few, but specific, goals: decolonization, the dismantling of the authoritarian regime via a political and social revolution, and economic development. The pursuit of these goals unleashed a host of previously excluded forces. Political parties of every ideological configuration emerged from underground while others sprang anew in the postcoup chaos. Spontaneous demonstrations erupted all over Portugal. Previously excluded from participation, these elements vied for power in the postcoup settlement. The dynamics of this internal and external transformation affected the character and consequences of the new democratic regime. With the eruption of popular participation came the struggles for power among the political parties, particularly, the older, more organized parties of the traditional opposition: the Portuguese Communist party and the Socialist party. These parties vied for power and support internally from the flood of new participants, and externally from allies in their respective party organizations. By exploring the antecedents to this transformation, the authoritarian regime's policies, and the dynamics of the transformation process, it is possible to evaluate the causes and consequences of that transformation. The following thesis emerges: Portugal's transformation from an authoritarian regime is inextricably related to the shortcomings of the Estado Novo (New State), particularly the colonial and economic policies; the affront to the military's self-interest; and the costs and hardships of the unwinnable colonial wars. The second thesis emerges: this transformation unleashed a dynamic flood of popular participation in Portuguese politics at a critical time in superpower relations, which thrust the transformation from authoritarianism to democracy in Portugal into the much greater global transformation of East-West detente.",303767873,,Dissertations & Theses," Nichols, Christianna E.NicholsE.ChristiannaNichols, Christianna E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744786921 , 28077671 , 66569 , 9004742 , 9004742", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303767873?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+internal+and+external+dimensions+of+the+Portuguese+revolution.+%28Volumes+I+and+II%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nichols%2C+Christianna+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3394,Jean Henri Merle d'Aubigne: Historian of Christianity in an age of revolution,"This is the first critical study in English of the works of Jean Henri Merle d'Aubigne (1794-1872), a Genevan Reformed historian of Christianity. Its primary focus is Merle d'Aubigne's historiography, examining his development as a historian, his conception of history, his understanding of divine and human agency in history, and his historical writings, mainly on the Reformation. Merle d'Aubigne's writings appeared at a time when Protestant nations, in their search for stability after the French Revolution, were looking back to the sixteenth century as the foundation of modern society, and his interpretation of the Reformation proposed principles for a new relationship between church and state in the nineteenth century. Merle d'Aubigne's impact as a historian of Christianity was very extensive in his own day, especially on the English-speaking Evangelical movement. In all, he published over 85 works: historical narratives, discourses, articles, letters, and sermons. His most important work is Histoire de la Reformation du siezieme siecle, 5 vols. (Paris-Geneva, 1835-1853), but it was the English edition of this, entitled History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth Century, (Edinburgh, 1846-1853), that made him famous. The extent of Merle's influence can also be seen in his seminal role in the establishment of ecumenical societies, such as the Evangelical Alliance, and social welfare institutions, such as the international YMCA and Red Cross. As a historian Merle d'Aubigne incorporated the new scientific methods into his narratives, and his historical consciousness was refined by August Neander, under whom he studied at the University of Berlin. Since the Enlightenment, however, ""sacred history"" had been separated from ""secular history,"" and orthodox Christian interpretations of history came into sharp conflict with modern science. Merle's greatest achievement was a detailed study of the Reformation that searched for the uniquely religious elements, the personal and emotional life of individuals, and the manifestations of divine providence. Through a Romantic style of writing he became immensely popular. He may be considered a transitional figure in Church historical writing because he promulgated a traditional orthodox interpretation of history clothed in new scientific garments.",303793778,,Dissertations & Theses," Roney, John BurtonRoneyBurtonJohnRoney, John Burton", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744792781 , 28078531 , 66569 , 0315546085 , 9780315546080 , NL54608 , NL54608", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989," 0315546085 , 9780315546080", English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303793778?accountid=14496, 0320 Religious history, 0320 Religious history, 0320 Religious history,, 0320 Religious history, Religious history," Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jean+Henri+Merle+d%27Aubigne%3A+Historian+of+Christianity+in+an+age+of+revolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roney%2C+John+Burton&amp;isbn=0315546085&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3395,Resistance to state authority. A study in social ethics with special regard to radical criticism of the state in United States Catholicism after the Second Vatican Council,"Human well-being and Christian salvation are interrelated. Therefore the struggle for justice and peace is an essential part of the proclamation of the Christian faith. This 'political' duty leads to the question of how Christians should react to state authority. The New Testament and Catholic social teaching generally respect the institution of the state, consists in furthering the common good, which can only be done by universal cooperation. Obedience to state authority, even in democracies, must never be blind or 'deaf'. As history shows, democratic authorities can do and command immoral things, can commit crimes. Therefore resistance (in the extensive sense of the word) may be necessary in democracies. One form of such resistance that has a long tradition in the United States (Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King) and that is sometimes adequate and morally right is civil disobedience. During the Vietnam War a movement of predominantly Catholic peace activists, the so-called 'US Catholic Left', were the brothers Daniel and Philip Berrigan. After the end of the Vietnam War they have concentrated on resistance to nuclear weapons. The critics of the Berrigans are right in several aspects. Yet as 'prophetic shock minorities' (J. Maritain) the Berrigans point towards a central truth: If we do not turn around the arms race, we might commit global suicide.",303793993,,Dissertations & Theses," Remele, KurtRemeleKurtRemele, Kurt", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740697121 , 28809051 , 66569 , C447514 , C447514", Dissertation/Thesis, 1989,, German, German,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303793993?accountid=14496," 0469 Theology , 0615 Political science , 0344 Social research"," 0469 Theology , 0615 Political science , 0344 Social research"," 0469 Theology , 0615 Political science , 0344 Social research",," 0469 Theology , 0615 Political science , 0344 Social research"," Theology , Political science , Social research"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Vatican II",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Resistance+to+state+authority.+A+study+in+social+ethics+with+special+regard+to+radical+criticism+of+the+state+in+United+States+Catholicism+after+the+Second+Vatican+Council&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Remele%2C+Kurt&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3396,For a future that works: new movements for social and economic change.,"The thesis starts by identifying a global problematique, increasingly threatening human survival, which is composed of four great, interlinked problem areas: war, insecurity and militarism; the persistence of poverty; the denial of human rights; and environmental destruction. The conventional approaches to this four-fold crisis are analysed by a comparative discussion of the work of the three United Nations Commissions which were set up to deal with one aspect of it: the Brandt, Palme and Brundtland Commissions, with a focus on economic development, peace and security, and environment and development respectively. The thesis finds these Commissions' analyses partial and flawed and proceeds to discussion of the issues by examining the lives and work of individuals who and organisations which have been involved at the grassroots level, mobilising people and lobbying decision-makers, or devising and implementing concrete strategies of change. The thesis ranges widely over the issues concerned with chapters on peace and security, human rights, economic development, the environment, and human development. The conclusion of the thesis identifies the root causes of the crisis as Western scientism- and developmentalism, and the unfettered, inappropriate and irresponsible power of the nation-state. In specifically addressing each of these causes, the new movements for social and economic change are engaged in a process of democratisation, the success of which is by no means guaranteed but which is a prerequisite for long-term peace, human dignity and ecological sustainability.",301515050,,Dissertations & Theses," Ekins, P.W.EkinsP.W.Ekins, P.W.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756267781 , 44401431 , 101309 , U030507 , U030507", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301515050?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," (UMI)AAIU030507 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=For+a+future+that+works%3A++new+movements+for+social+and+economic+change.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ekins%2C+P.W.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3397,"German socialism in british exile, 1840-1859","Between 1840 and 1860 much of the development of early German socialism and social democracy occurred in emigrants' communities abroad, the most important of which was in London. This thesis examines the political activities, organisations and debates in this colony, which for many years also formed the social and intellectual context of Marx's ideas. The organisational centre for socialist exiles was the German Workers' Educational Association. Within German artisanal socialism, it became the single most important centre of ideological debate of the `utopian' Weitling's doctrines, of Marx's views, and of early socialist internationalism. After the failure of the 1848 revolution, the returning refugees fragmented into mutually hostile groups of socialists and non-socialist democrats. Many socialists, however, were also attracted by the uncompromising revolutionarism of the Blanquists, and when this began to clash with Marx's economic analysis, the main organisation of the socialists, the Communist League, split. The public image of exile politics, however, was dominated by the much larger factions of exiled democrats (around Gottfried Kinkel and Arnold Ruge), who are analysed here with respect to their attitude to socialist demands. In particular the larger section of the Communist League under August Willich co-operated closely with non-socialist democrats in order to promote a revolutionary revival at home, as well as dominating the Germans' relations to both Chartists and French exiles. On the whole, thus, the socialist movement was much broader and more tolerant of other groups than the previous scholarly concentration on Marx's politics alone would suggest. The mid-fifties have long been regarded as a period of decline in socialist development, but in London the Germans continued to be involved in propaganda and organisation. A new international association represented a wide variety of exiled socialists, ranging from Weitlingian communists to those straddling socialism and liberal democracy. The dissertation concludes with the renewed conflict between the socialists and democrats in the late 1850s, which was focussed intensively for the first time on the issue of national unification.",301523958,,Dissertations & Theses," Lattek, ChristineLattekChristineLattek, Christine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756102841 , 44242281 , 101309 , U025660 , U025660", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301523958?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU025660 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=German+socialism+in+british+exile%2C+1840-1859&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lattek%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3398,"Law and order in colonial Puerto Rico: a critical assessment of the criminal justice system, 1974 to 1984.","The Law and Order project emerged in a particular period (1974-84) of the history of colonial Puerto Rico, when capital was re-structuring its production relations in the island, shifting from labour intensive to capital intensive production. This process resulted from the international crisis of capital accumulation during the early 1970s. This economic evolution had an impact over the economic model of development in Puerto Rico (the so-called ""Bootstrap"" model) which, due to capital restructuring, lost its most important feature: the modernizing element of the society which had provided a certain degree of wealth distribution and the basic needs of the working class and popular sectors. However, the effects on the population of this economic process were devastating, prompting many sectors of the labour movement to demonstrate against the economic situation. Since this period, the state has dealt with an increasing surplus population for whom the foreign capital investing in the island does not produce sufficient jobs. Unemployment has been on the increase ever since 1974 in Puerto Rico. Nonetheless, the impact of the crisis in the working class and popular sectors has been ameliorated by the boosting of financial funds from the metropolitan state. This thesis conducts a critical analysis of the law and order project initiated since 1974 by the colonial power bloc, constituted by the metropolitan bourgeoisie and a colonial bourgeoisie which is divided into two main fractions: a pro-annexation bourgeoisie, the Nuevo Progresistas and a pro-commonwealth bourgeoisie, the Populares, For the colonial bourgeoisie the law and order project has been sheltered under the cover of the ""war on crime"". Official statistics have been used ever since the economic crisis of 1974 to justify an increasing tendency of the state to strengthen the repressive mechanism. However, as I examine carefully, behind this policy against crime, the colonial state has been pursuing a more repressive attitude towards the surplus population that is increasing and becoming marginal to the productive process. Although both fractions of the colonial bourgeoisie have coincided with the particular agenda of law and order for the new times, they have also included the particular interests of their class project. In this sense during the political administration of the Nuevo Progresistas their law and order was expanded to the repression of political dissidents. This pattern, as I analyse, created the foundations of a crisis of authority for the power bloc. The repression of this fraction of the dominant bloc was extended to different social sectors in the colonial society. The hegemony of the dominant class was put into question in colonial Puerto Rico. Thus, it was necessary for the metropolitan state to intervene in the colonial society at the beginning of the 1980s. The U.S., in alliance with the Populares, redefined the law and order project, and tackled non-traditional areas of illegal behaviour such as corruption and police abuses of power. The importance of the intervention of the metropolitan power was that it defined the limits of the colonial bourgeoisie by altering the colonial order. Two theoretical frameworks have been used. First, historical materialism will provide the adequate instruments to explore the impact of the capital re-structuring in the island production relations and the effects this process had on the form adopted by the Commonwealth state and on the definition of law and order. Second, critical criminology, from the so-called political economy of crime, will complement the analysis when exploring the development of the criminal justice system of this Caribbean island.

The tourist phenomenon plays a great part in the international movement of people and as I discussed in Chapter II now it almost comprises five per cent of the total world consumer expenditure. At a national level, tourism in many countries has been, if not the main, then one of the major activities and is playing a vital role in the earning of foreign currency and contributes greatly to many countries' Balance of Payments. Tourism can also be vital as a source of employment and helps to improve the country's infrastructure and facilities and can bring an injection of money into an area. It was also discussed in Chapter II that the more advanced and self sufficient the country then the less the need for imported goods and sevices; this makes the multiplier effect higher. The inflationary impact of tourism though is high and although in many countries it is a capital intensive industry it often has a low capital return which can induce governments, especially from the Third World, to seek outside investment, thereby making the industry less profitable to the country. One of the faults of many governmental agencies is that they tend to deal with tourism as if it were purely a sales product and perhaps ignore the social consequences that it may have upon the local population. These undesirable consequences may be: tourist saturation, under-use or over-use of facilities and the infrastructure, and the loss of national indentity, among many others. It was argued that the characteristics of the tourists, i.e. the number of tourists, the tourists' length of stay and racial characteristics etc. can determine the rate of social impact between them and the locals. There are also many variables connected with the destination area which determine the rate of social impact in the area; these are mainly: the economic development of the area, the degree of local involvement in tourism, and local culture etc. In Chapter III my main consideration was tourism planning and development and it was argued that because of misconceptions about the nature of tourism and its organisation many adverse socio-economic consequences were to be seen in many countries created by the development of the tourist industry. It was proposed that all tourism planning should be based on two classes of preliminary survey: a) detailed surveys of the characteristics of the area and its tourist resources. b) studies of future customers and market potential. With a formal and advanced planning programme tourism can bring substantial economic growth to the area with economic revitalisation, a higher standard of living, and preservation of the environment. In formulating a tourism planning programme in order to achieve the benefits mentioned above, concentration must be on how much foreign exchange is to be gained, what part tourism is to have in the national economy and how much the country is prepared to invest in tourism, and in what areas. It was also discussed that when drawing up a tourism planning programme consideration should be given to both the existing and the planned facilities, the capacity to serve a particular development and the range and nature of facilities to be provided. In order that the reader may have the background information in order to identify with one of my main areas of study in this paper, Iran, I gave, early in Chapter IV, a general analysis of tourism in the Third World and Islamic countries, this of course being vastly different from the tourism to be found in the West. Later, a general background was given on the culture of Iran and the Iranian economy, its agriculture and industry. This was done in order to give the reader a clear view of the country itself before talking of the tourism and lifestyle to be found there pre-revolution.

Starting from a historical survey it contrasts two visions of 'information society' (IS), and then goes on to depict the social background from which these visions arise. It is found that since the 1960s the capitalist world system has been undergoing crisis, and it becomes especially obvious in the 1980s that IT has been playing a crucial role in restructuring capitalism. As such, the concept of IS and practical functions subsumed by IT have important implications for (semi-)peripheral countries . As one of the widely claimed economic 'miracles' Taiwan's recent developmental trajectory is particularly useful for realising how IT functions and how dominant ideas about 'IS' disseminate. Benefiting from selling IT, Taiwan's experience cannot be said to have constituted a successful story supporting the modernisation theory. Rather, the developmental process she has so far gone through fits the arguments of the world-system approach. Taiwan's quick rise to seize IT for expanding her economic base tells a very good example as how the international capital, the state, and the national capital cooperate and clash. In contrast, Taiwan's records of using IT for production, transmission or consumption are rather poor. This reflects her position in the world system in general, however, it is a necessary result considering that her economic structure is based on small business. On the side of ideological representations, this study confirms the dominant pattern of IT coverage in the popular media (newspapers). Though the newspapers have not yet produced a coherent articulation of different elements of the idea of 'IS', it relays uncritically the established (the government and the business) perspectives on IT and 'IS'.

The family used the step-migration pattern that took them from the rancho El Porvenir to the border town of Tecate, Baja California, and then to Santa Ana, California. A major theoretical position presented in this research is that migration, at least in the modern Mexican case, is undertaken by families rather than individuals. Decisions to migrate are made by the family as a corporate group. In this study, each adult member consulted with, and acted on behalf of, the other family members with regard to the social and economic consequences of migration. Family members remained in contact with each other throughout the total migration period which in this research covered a period of 45 years. The family first experienced migration when they moved from the Sinaloa highlands to work in the cash crop development in the Sinaloa coastal plain. Following an initial family member's move to the agricultural zone of which Tecate was the center, other members migrated to join the industrial labor force growing up around the town's newly organized maquiladora system. By participating in this system, they acquired new skills mostly in the electronic industry and became part of the dynamics of the border economy. Involvement in the maquiladoras resulted in opportunities for entering the international work force in California. Through all the several migration steps, the core family members and the new affinals who joined them continued to act as a unit. At the end of the migration process, they established a pattern of movement which found family members moving back and forth between the original plot in Sinaloa and the new households in Tecate and Santa Ana, with a tendency toward permanent residence in their destination places. Some members preferred to maintain their nuclear families in Sinaloa, and plan to return and live there permanently. The examination of these preferences suggests that this migratory pattern is a significant aspect of Mexican family coherence.",303812717,,Dissertations & Theses," Funez-Gonzalez, JuaniFunez-GonzalezJuaniFunez-Gonzalez, Juani", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746624341 , 29853471 , 66569 , 9022309 , 9022309", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303812717?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0626 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0626 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0626 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0626 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Los+Garcia%3A+Family+strategies+for+migration+in+Mexico+and+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Funez-Gonzalez%2C+Juani&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3402,"The ascent of Boston's Jews, 1630-1918","In January 1909, Jacob De Haas, the editor of the Boston Advocate, invited readers to respond to the question ""What methods would tend most to unite the Jews?"" He was undoubtedly discouraged by the answers. In Boston, commented one rabbi, ""we may notice the distinct constituent elements of Jewry, different religions, different races, classes hopelessly out of social sympathy with one another, and far differing ideals of the necessary and the desirable."" Other respondents were equally cynical about the chances for a group rapprochement. By the end of the First World War, however, Boston's Jews had reached common ground. A new spirit of cooperation was evident not only in the pages of the weekly Jewish newspaper, but also in the efforts of the community to aid European war victims, to work together for a Jewish state in Palestine, and to oppose the immigration restriction movement. This dissertation explains how the Jews of Boston overcame the obstacles they faced in becoming a self-assertive, and articulate ethnic community. Chapter one discusses the Puritans' attitude toward Jews, and the history of the Jews who lived in Boston during the colonial and early national periods. The second chapter analyzes the reasons why Jews abandoned their native lands, and where they settled in the city. The third chapter describes their economic ascent. The fourth chapter discusses Boston's autonomous Jewish charities, as well as the history of local branches of national and international Jewish philanthropic organizations. Chapter five analyzes the evolving religious practices in Boston's synagogues through a case study of Rabbi Solomon Schindler. Chapter six explains how Boston Jewry resolved the conflict between the duties of American citizenship and the demands of ethnic solidarity. An appendix with sixty-nine tables analyzes their voting behavior. In their arguments over Zionism, and in their gradual recognition that they formed a community with distinct political interests, Boston's Jews helped redefine the meaning of American ethnicity. By 1918, they had become ""American Jews,"" who took equal pride in their ancient heritage and in their new citizenship.",303838761,,Dissertations & Theses," Braverman, William AlanBravermanAlanWilliamBraverman, William Alan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746623841 , 29424731 , 66569 , 9021785 , 9021785", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303838761?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0320 Religious history"," 0337 American history , 0320 Religious history"," 0337 American history , 0320 Religious history",," 0337 American history , 0320 Religious history"," American history , Religious history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+ascent+of+Boston%27s+Jews%2C+1630-1918&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Braverman%2C+William+Alan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3403,The politics of transition to socialism in Cuba and North Korea,"Both critics and defenders of socialism often regard socialism as the full negation of all capitalist social structures. However, a careful analysis of socialist practices in the Third World reveals that the construction of socialism depends not only on the pre-revolutionary structure, but also on the specific dynamics of the domestic and international opposition. A realistic understanding of socialism requires an examination of the interactions between domestic and international political forces and the socio-economic factors constraining this relationship. This comparative analysis of the transitionary processes in Cuba and north Korea during the period of 1959 to 1970 and 1945 to 1961, respectively, confirms the importance of these interactions in shaping socialist societies. Among the conditions favorable to the socialist transformations of both Cuba and north Korea were the large number of wage workers and landless peasants, the discrediting of the bourgeoisie for their collaboration with neo-colonial or colonial forces, the strong leftist sentiment among the masses, and the decision by anti-socialist forces to flee their country rather than remaining to fight. These factors enabled both regimes to avoid the repressive use of force and to develop a more humane socialism, despite the severe technical and financial losses inflicted by the exodus of the bourgeoisie. The legitimacy of the north Korean and Cuban regimes is based upon the role of Kim Il-Sung and Fidel Castro, respectively, in each revolutionary struggle. Their background in guerrilla movements contributed to the widening of their perspectives beyond narrow class-biased communism. In each country, power was then centralized to maintain unity against ""imperialist"" aggressions and to secure the power of the hegemonic leader and group. Both Cuba and north Korea experienced U.S. intervention, blockades, and a sudden isolation from the world capitalist system during their transitionary period. Although aid from socialist allies was received, Cuba was forced to reduce its revolutionary internationalism to secure Soviet aid, whereas north Korea succeeded in resisting Soviet interference through successful industrialization. Thus, a fair understanding of Third World socialism requires much more than a static conception of socialism. Instead, a study of the effect of historical constraints on the evolving vision of socialism is necessary in any study of Third World socialism.",303845652,,Dissertations & Theses," Kwon, Hyuk-BumKwonHyuk-BumKwon, Hyuk-Bum", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745152301 , 29588231 , 66569 , 9110171 , 9110171", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303845652?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0332 History , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0332 History , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0332 History , 0336 Latin American history",," 0615 Political science , 0332 History , 0336 Latin American history"," Political science , History , Latin American history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+transition+to+socialism+in+Cuba+and+North+Korea&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kwon%2C+Hyuk-Bum&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3404,The dynamics of the settler state: A comparative study of Israel and South Africa,"This study compares Israel and South Africa in the context of their common origins as settler states. It seeks to avoid polemical treatment of the two nations and their relations. To this end a theoretical framework is established for the analysis of settler systems. A critical consideration is made of existing approaches--among them ""fragmentation"" theory, frontier theory, pluralism, and internal colonialism. The strengths of these are incorporated into a model which combines the concept of the articulation of modes of production with current theory on the peripheral capitalist state. The two cases are examined at three historical stages (early settlement, state consolidation, and the modern system) as well as from three analytical emphases (domestic political-economy, ideology, and global system influences). This approach allows the study to distinguish among the various impacts of the settlement process, e.g., the impact of the Afrikaner farmers on the ""hunter-gatherer"" Khoisan was distinctly different than that of British colonialism at the advent of the mining industry upon the ""pastoral"" Zulu kingdom. The emphasis on the articulation of the modes of production also takes into account the differing natures of the indigenous social systems. Another area of contrast which serves the analysis is between the exploitation of labor in South Africa and the desire of the dominant stream of Zionist movement in Palestine to pursue the policy of ""Jewish labor."" The study suggests that factors inherent in the settlement process led to the eclipse of the latter. More broadly this dissertation concludes that settlement processes may be richly explored for what they reveal about the nature of modern states.",303855886,,Dissertations & Theses," Will, Donald ScottWillScottDonaldWill, Donald Scott", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745152461 , 29356711 , 66569 , 9110243 , 9110243", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303855886?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0331 African history , 0333 Middle Eastern history"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0331 African history , 0333 Middle Eastern history"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0331 African history , 0333 Middle Eastern history",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0331 African history , 0333 Middle Eastern history"," International law , International relations , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , African history , Middle Eastern history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+dynamics+of+the+settler+state%3A+A+comparative+study+of+Israel+and+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Will%2C+Donald+Scott&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3405,The urban informal economy and the state in Tanzania,"Most explanations for economic restructuring in Africa are concerned primarily with how such changes are the product of external pressures from the world economy and from international lending institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. This study focuses on the role of the informal economy in explaining some of the internal circumstances that allowed Tanzania to embark on a program of economic reform and austerity at a time when urban dwellers, in particular, were suffering enormous hardships. Their disengagement from the state and reliance on their own solutions helps explain why they did not always feel the full force of cutbacks in government expenditure. At the same time, people continued to resist policies that infringed on their ability to carry out informal income-generating activities through strategies of non-compliance. The Tanzanian state thus found itself attempting to mediate between conflicting internal and external pressures. In the late 1970s and 1980s the informal economy grew in Tanzania, as in other African countries, in response to deepening economic crisis. This growth resulted in major reversals in the direction of resource flows: away from the state towards private solutions to problems of income, security and social welfare; away from reliance on wage labor to reliance on informal incomes and farming; and a gradual shifting of migration patterns with increasing movement out of the city into the rural areas. Similarly, relations of obligation in the household were being transformed with new resource dependencies on women, children and the elderly, while only a decade earlier, most urban women had relied on men for income, children on their parents and the elderly on their adult children. This study adopts a societal-oriented approach in contrast to the prevalent state-centric emphasis of the study of African politics. Based on fieldwork carried out between 1987 and 1988, the research combined both quantitative and qualitative methods, involving informal interviews and formal surveys of workers and small-scale entrepreneurs in addition to discussions with Party and Government leaders at all levels.",303862502,,Dissertations & Theses," Tripp, Aili MariTrippMariAiliTripp, Aili Mari", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745627691 , 29862671 , 66569 , 9114651 , 9114651", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, English, English,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303862502?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Political science , Womens studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , informal economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+urban+informal+economy+and+the+state+in+Tanzania&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tripp%2C+Aili+Mari&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3406,Dynamic simulation model of groundwater movement in the vadose zone using the percolation process,"This thesis is an investigation of the use of the percolation process in simulating groundwater movement in unsaturated soil conditions. It is felt that the resulting product will be a useful tool in the design process of landscape architecture. The product of this thesis is the result of a collaboration among people of different disciplines. The underlying theme lies in the belief that the development of new technology may help to resolve some of the problems created in the past. This technology however, must be accompanied by a full understanding of the social, political and economic consequences. The work has been divided into three chapters, the first is an overview of global concerns. It is meant to establish the contextual position of the research, and offer a philosophical base. The second deals strictly with the groundwater system as object of study. The third chapter reveals the proposed model and outcome of the study. Future additional studies are suggested for the elaboration of the model. The illustrations are intended as a visual introduction to the main arguments confronted in the thesis.

The first three chapters are a description of Bauer's nationalism theory concerning the dissolution of the multinational Habsburg empire, mainly from emphasising its German nationalistic contents and the later formulation of an 'annexation theory' in 1917-18. Chapter IV discusses the enforcement of the 'annexation theory' in the Social Democratic Party's program by Bauer in autumn 1918 and the inclusion in the program of the governments of the young Republic of Austria, the development of a concept to transform it into political reality (i.e. negotiations, participation on the German constitutional assembly of Weimar, Ludo Moritz Hartmann's activities, propaganda, etc.) and the position of the German government in connection with the initiatives of Austria (i.e. invasion in November 1918 in Tyrol and Salzburg, Solf's understanding of German foreign policy, the long term perspective of 'Anschlusz' in Berlin's view, etc.). Chapter V deals with the requirement, the preparation and the realisation of Berlin's negotiations in February and March 1919. The subjects, the commissions of Otto Bauer and Ulrich Brockdorff-Rantzau are discussed. The final chapter describes the international connection of Bauer's 'annexation policy' in 1919, the reaction of Entente governments to the initiative of the Austrian Secretary of State, its consequences for the peace negotiations in Paris and, at last, the failure of this early 'annexation movement'.",303890194,,Dissertations & Theses," Pichler, ChristianPichlerChristianPichler, Christian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744116391 , 29362731 , 66569 , C257700 , C257700", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990,, German, German,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303890194?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," Social sciences , Bauer, Otto",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+%27Anschluss%27-policy+of+Otto+Bauer%2C+1918-1919%3A++Paradigm+of+a+conflict+of+theory+and+practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pichler%2C+Christian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3408,"TCO and the women, 1944-1974. A study of the labour market policy of the Central Organization of Salaried Employees (TCO) and the Swedish Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry (SIF) and their treatment of the principle of equal wages for equal work","The central point of this study concerns the question to what degree the principle of equal wages for women and men met with sympathy in the salaried employees movement. This question has also been reflected in parliamentary debates and through the Swedish government's contacts with the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva. Some of the TCO's board members were members of the parliament as well and participated in wage policy debates. TCO was, in addition, a referral authority on various questions that were treated on the political level. The question of equal wages has been treated from a perspective of conflict. One of the working hypotheses has been that women not only meet resistance from employers, but also from men in the labour market. There is a conflict between the sexes when salaries and careers are concerned, and this opposition is expressed in the union representatives' actions or lack of actions. In the trade union debate it is clear that equal wages for equal work was considered to be established in limited areas during the period 1944-1974. Teachers within the state area were perhaps the group that most nearly approached this vision. In the debate that went on within SIF no examples that the principle was implemented have been given, but the women's relative share of the men's wages increased. The general hiring policies within the public sector were less discriminating than those within the private area. Neither within the public nor the private sector did women succeed in reaching equality with men in regard to the possibility of entering various posts and, especially, qualified ones. Some of the explanations for this discrimination might be that women were not treated equally with men in the wage agreements and that the inequality was institutionalized in the negotiation system. On the political level the ""Swedish Model"" was used as an excuse for not acting. Discrimination was sometimes openly expressed in the trade union representatives' speeches and in their referrals to the government on questions of social policy. Another sub-explanation is the women's weak representation in the white-collar trade union boards on different levels.

The forties and fifties in Spain, even though they are frequently considered entirely as an age of economic and social post-civil-war crisis and lack of interest in urban changes, show, at least, two well-differentiated moments: the forties and the beginning of the fifties, the first stage, represent all the negative aspects of a society subdued by the hard conditions involved in the Civil War; the late fifties, on the other hand, meant a slow but determined tendency toward change, in which economic recovery occurred along with an increasing international acceptance of the Spanish dictatorship's political establishment. Regarding urban planning activity, all the previous issues result in two completely different movements: a big in-migration in the first of the above explained periods, when all urban problems became more and more difficult, and the beginning of growth in the large Spanish cities, in the the second one. Seville also shows some unique aspects that imply a more critical situation than other Spanish cities: a fast demographic increase, especially due to in-migration of rural origin and difficult conditions inherited from the municipal bankruptcy in the year 1934, after the 1929 Iberoamerican Exhibition. Anyway, this age cannot be considered as a period without interest in Seville. The forties are frustrating years for the municipal urban planning policy, although not lacking, because of it, expansion and improvement proposals, in fact, the first general planning in town appears in 1946; the great affluence of in-migrants implies a continuous renovation in the town houses to accommodate the increasing numbers of in-migrating people. All of the points mentioned above mean a large number of reforms: new divisions of the inner space of houses to increase their lodging capacity, adding new floors to the buildings and other similar operations. The fifties, above all in the second part, show signs of change: although inner reform projects are rarely completed, they are performed in great part. This doctoral thesis not only analyses and organises the available information about the inner transformation of Seville in order to understand it correctly, but also shows the social context in which those changes are made and the way the inner reform influenced all the urban protagonists: the Town Council, other public institutions, building companies, building owners and tenants.",303914163,,Dissertations & Theses," Fernandez Salinas, Victor ManuelFernandez SalinasManuelVictorFernandez Salinas, Victor Manuel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744191751 , 29364371 , 66569 , 9788477763673 , 8477763674 , C349097 , C349097", Dissertation/Thesis, 1990," 9788477763673 , 8477763674", Spanish, Spanish,,1990,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303914163?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+inner+reform+of+Seville+between+1940+and+1959&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fernandez+Salinas%2C+Victor+Manuel&amp;isbn=9788477763673&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3410,The disarmament-development linkage,"The purpose of this study is to explore the linkage of disarmament and development. The linkage has progressively evolved through resolutions at the United Nations since its founding in 1945. It has become a major variable in the establishment of the New International Economic Order (NIEO). The philosophy behind the link is one of redistribution of wealth and power. The movement toward general and complete disarmament, as proposed by the United Nations, should accordingly result in freeing of money which should then be rerouted to development of the Third World. The proposed result is seen to promote social and economic equality, and help eliminate the gap between the North and the South. The accomplishment of general and complete disarmament would end the arms race and dissolve East-West tensions. Thus, this link would create world peace. Critical observations are needed for a closer examination of the disarmament - development linkage.

In Scandinavia it started up during the Cold War years, but developed primarily in the controversial atmosphere created by the Vietnam war, the process of decolonialization and the growing awareness about underdevelopment and international dependencies. With a point of departure in philosophical hermeneutics, the study gives an account of the three decades of peace research in Scandinavia by inquiring about the research tradition through which this corpus of research is connected with the more general movement of social science. Peace research in Scandinavia, mediated as text, is reconstructed in the thematic unity of semantic paradigms in the text, and, as another methodical level in the study, brought up in its structure of methodological tradition.

Investigations into the liturgical developments in Denmark (ca. 1800 until ca. 1950),"Research on the developments within the liturgy of the Lutheran 'Folkekirke' (folk church) in Denmark during the Enlightenment and Romantic Era and the period following until ca. 1950 is obstructed when the scope of research is limited to the form of service and its theological background. Three complementary liturgical components are therefore included: texts of the Ordinary and Propers of the Mass and of other religious rites (part I), hymn text books (part II), and hymn singing (part III). In this manner, renewal is presented in the triad of ritual, poetry and music, known as liturgy. Just as form and content are inseparably bound, theologia and artes form a dynamic powerplay in people's attempts to attune the liturgical life in its broadest sense to life and society in general. In considering the so-called Liturgical Movement as an international and interconfessional phenomenon, Denmark plays a unique role, especially where the renewing power of hymn texts and hymn singing are concerned. In the area where the work of the poet, historian, pedagogue, politician and clergyman, N. F. S. Grundtvig (1783-1872), brought about liturgical and social renewal affecting the vast majority of the people, the power play differed essentially in comparison to the liturigical developments in the Danish overseas possessions (Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland) and those in Norway, Sweden and Finland.

Around 1780 the idea of moving the garden to a better site was being considered. The Botanical Garden was steadily going from bad to worse. The insufficient amount given to pay the expenses was the reason why advised repairs were not carried out. Furthermore, the distance would also have been an influential factor as well as the fact that the Garden was getting too small to hold the constantly growing number of plants. In 1781 the Botanical Garden was inaugurated. This inauguration could have gone down in history as just another of the many social reunions which formed a part of the palatial intellectual life in Madrid at that time, but this particular reunion had other ends, not only the collecting and cultivating of rare or medicinal plants, but also the search for a way of incorporating into the country the philosophy of an intellectual movement, one of whose basic principles was the understanding of nature. In the second part of the work presented the initial working of the Botanical Garden is analysed; the aims of the garden, the first rules which regulated the work, the herb rooms, the library, the teaching and other activities (the creation of a perfume factory and a school of plant imitation), the scientific relationship of the Botanical Garden (national and international), the seed house, the pharmacological studies of the Botanical Garden, the Botanical Garden and the botanic expeditions (the botanic expedition to New Spain, the Pacific expeditions and others), the Botanical Garden and the Royal Academy of Medicine in Madrid, the initial working of the professorship of Agriculture of the Botanical Garden, the publications of the Botanical Garden and the existing positions and posts in the Botanical Garden.

The political, pedagogical, and autobiographical contexts informing the research are discussed in chapter I. Research questions are grouped under three themes: peace, pedagogy, and culture. In chapter II, the issues of peace and hope are dealt with historically through a literature review on the peace concept and the peace education movement. The comprehensiveness of the review is intended to bring about a holistic notion of what peace education has meant in the past and what newer understanding can emerge in the future. Chapter III deals with the issues of peace and hope methodologically. The chapter describes the search for a non-violent research methodology which implies semiological analysis and ethnographic inquiry. Practical application of a peaceful research model consists of semiotic consciousness, dialogic conversation, ethnographic observation, democratic participation, and the art of hermeneutics. The attempt to concretize the themes of peace and hope as process of human actions and praxis of ethics is examined. Chapter IV is the semiological study of four sets of video materials featuring Jubilee Public School as blueprints for peace education or good pedagogy. Research focus is put on how the media captures important spirits of Jubilee Public School as well as on how television freezes public understanding of what has been happening in the school. The semiological study attempts to present a radical questioning of the logic of modern epistemology, which in turn would suggest new ways to look at peace, pedagogy, and culture. Chapter V is an ethnography of Jubilee Public School. The life stories of the Jubilee community, the principal, custodian, teachers, volunteers, parents, and students are presented with the guiding question of ""how school participants are brought more fully into life in Jubilee Public School?"" I hope that the lived curriculum of the school participants sheds light on our understanding of some important pedagogical issues which include; personal peace, human rights, ethnicities and identities, multiculturalism, citizenship education, conflict resolution, structural violence, co-operative learning, social injustice, and education for global responsibility. The chapter highlights the possibilities and difficulties in implementing peace education in Canadian school systems. Chapter VI is reflection on the multiple meanings in undertaking the research. As a postscript, I return to the pattern of human life of some participants and contextualize their struggles of peace and hope as legitimate concerns in modern pedagogy and philosophy.",230777743,,Dissertations & Theses," Cheng, Yee-wahChengYee-wahCheng, Yee-wah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746231971 , 31388081 , 66569 , 0315667605 , 9780315667600 , NN66760 , NN66760", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991," 0315667605 , 9780315667600", English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/230777743?accountid=14496," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0615 Political science"," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0615 Political science"," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0615 Political science",," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0615 Political science"," Social studies education , Educational theory , Curricula , Teaching , Political science"," Social sciences , Education , peace education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Possibilities+for+a+pedagogy+of+peace+and+hope+in+a+world+of+transformation&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cheng%2C+Yee-wah&amp;isbn=0315667605&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3415,Brazil built: modern architecture 1936-1942.,"In the 1940s and 1950s, architecture in Brazil gained unprecedented prestige in the world of Modern Architecture. This new architecture was praised by architects all over the world, who looked to Brazil as the country which had inherited the Modernism of the pre-war period in Europe, and which was initiating a new phase of the assimilation of cultural and climatic considerations into it. In 1930 a new Government, with Getúio Vargas as President, had taken power in Brazil. It had the dual aim of completely changing the economic and social structures of the country while retaining a Brazilian cultural identity. The `Brazilianization' of all things European was actively and officially encouraged in all branches of the Arts; for the young generation of architects, the architecture of the Modern Movement was seen as the corollary to the modernization of society. Within a few years they had completed a series of buildings in what came to be recognized as the `Brazilian Style'. There were three inter-related reasons which made this feat possible: firstly, the programmes of industrialization and modernization of the Vargas Government; secondly, a unquestioning belief in the aesthetic principles of Le Corbusier; and, thirdly, the advanced state of engineering in reinforced concrete in Brazil. This architecture remained virtually unrecognized both in Brazil and abroad until its discovery and proclamation by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1943. The exhibition `Brazil Builds' was part of the Museum's policy of promoting European Modernism in the Arts. It was facilitated by the mixture of politics and artistic interests carried out by the Museum, firstly, under the New Deal, and later, with the approach of the World War II, under the Good Neighbour policies of the United States Government. The subsequent publication of the book Brazil Builds , beautifully produced and lavishly illustrated, brought immediate acclaim, both popular and professional, to Brazilian Modern architecture. In the United States and Britain, and after the war, in France and Italy, Brazilian Modernism was regarded as having successfully reconciled the abstract notions of International Modernism to regional requirements and cultural conditions. The major buildings - the Ministry of Education, the Brazilian Pavilion at the New York Worlds Fair 1939, the Brazilian Press Association, Santos Dumont Airport, the Pampulha complex - became widely known and highly influential. During the 1950s the `Brazilian Style' declined in creative energy until its swansong, Brasíia. It was rejected in Brazil, on the one hand, by the new military government of 1964 as being part of the liberal political inheritance of Vargas; and, on the other hand, ironically, by a new generation of architects as being a product of North American propaganda. It came to be reviled outside Brazil for its allegiance to the principles of Modernism, by then eclipsed by later developments. The contemporary re-evaluation of Modernism, and the restoration of democracy in Brazil, provide timely reasons to examine how the buildings came into being and around what concepts, how they came to be so highly regarded, and the changing reactions to them in Brazil and abroad.

Social networks are the focus of a large part of the study and are seen to be a very important mechanism in this case of unrecruited labour migration. They operate on an entirely different scale to the powerful forces of global capitalism which makes use of the migrant labour, but play a vital role in organising the movement and sustaining the new arrivals in the destination. Essential requirements such as housing and employment information are obtained from this source. The research goes on to show that over time the migrants' reliance on this informal, small-scale structure decreases in favour of state and private institutional services. Throughout the study, the emphasis is on the continuous interaction between migrant agency and structure emphasising the variety of ways in which structure is incorporated into behaviour. The context of this research is threefold: the organisation of the migration in the Caribbean, the experience of labour migrants in urban Britain with a case study of Leicester, and the return movement to Nevis. It concludes that the micro-scale social networks played a vital role in the migration process, assisting with the provision of a smooth supply of labour to the core economies.

This thesis considers the response of British trade unions to the Labour governments' public expenditure cuts during the period 1974-1979. The working hypothesis was that there was serious division within the TUC over cuts which had disarmed those attempting to defend the public services associated with the postwar consensus, and that this division corresponded not to established left-right positions, but to the sectoral location of unions' memberships. It was suggested that this division, which has received relatively little attention compared to divisions over wages policy, had nevertheless contributed significantly to the collapse of the Social Contract and to an important realignment within the Labour movement. Having surveyed existing literature on trade union debates on spending cuts, and the impact of spending cuts on the coherence of the Social Contract, central elements of the framework within which trade union policy responses developed are considered. The theoretical and political challenges to the postwar consensus on the social and economic role of the public sector, the constraints imposed on domstic policy-making by international political and economic forces, the chronology and content of government fiscal policy, and the historical development of TUC economic and political strategies, are all discussed. On the basis of conclusions drawn from these studies an analysis is made of the relevant policy statements and debates of both the TUC and of eight individual trade unions selected according to sectoral location. Conclusions are drawn about the nature of the division among TUC affiliates over spending cuts, the political complexion of the TUC economic thought, and the impact of the division on the Social Contract and trade union political affiliations.",301478401,,Dissertations & Theses," Ludlam, S.LudlamS.Ludlam, S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756304311 , 44408761 , 101309 , U035200 , U035200", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301478401?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," (UMI)AAIU035200 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Labourism+and+the+disintegration+of+the+postwar+consensus%3A++disunited+trade+union+economic+policy+responses+to+public+expenditure+cuts%2C+1974-1979.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ludlam%2C+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3418,A comparative study of urban land use planning systems in Scotland and China - with case studies in Edinburgh and Xian.,"This research is an empirical comparison of Scottish and Chinese urban land use planning systems. It tests the proposition put by Cherry (1984) that Planning is an international movement with a common language in concepts and methods. The shared ideas are readily observable: the objective of spatial order, the pursuit of amenity, the search for convenience in city form and structure ; and it explores the strengths and weakness of two major arguments of cross-national comparison of planning: a stage/evolutionary explanation proposed by Van den Berg et al (1982) and a stress on particular political structures and the disposition of power within the society. Major themes such as the historical development of urban planning, the ideological and theoretical concepts of planning, the institutions of governments and other agencies with planning responsibilities, the different statutory basis of the planning systems; and the practice of the two systems are examined and compared. Particular attention is given to the comparison of planning practice in the two case study cities - Edinburgh and Xian. The intention of this research is to seek the possibility to transfer ideas, experiences and policies between them and to improve the practice of the Chinese system. Although the findings support Cherry's proposition this research concludes that particular attention should be given to the different national cultural, historic, social-economic and political context of different societies. The research recognized that past transfer of planning skills from the west to China was confined to technical and physical design aspects without relevant institutional changes. Major recommendations are made toward covering this gap - to reform planning institutions, to improve planning legislation and practice.",301515028,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Y.P.WangY.P.Wang, Y.P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756236731 , 44394531 , 101309 , U033095 , U033095", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301515028?accountid=14496, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning,, 0999 Urban planning, Urban planning," (UMI)AAIU033095 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+comparative+study+of+urban+land+use+planning+systems+in+Scotland+and+China+-+with+case+studies+in+Edinburgh+and+Xian.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Y.P.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3419,"Victor Serge: political, social and literary critic of the USSR, 1919-1947; the reflections and activities of a Belgo-Russian revolutionary caught in the orbit of Soviet political history.","Victor Serge is known primarily as a revolutionary novelist, yet his work has received little scholarly literary attention. Two doctoral dissertations have explored Serge's literary expression in the last twenty-five years. This study is the first examination of Serge's historical and political-economic writings on the Soviet Union, based on his published and unpublished writings. Victor Serge is a unique political figure who utilized various literary forms to express his view of the nature of the social-political-economic system established during Stalin's rule. Pamphleteer, historian, poet, novelist, biographer, memoirist and journalist, Serge was at once Russian, Belgian, French and Spanish; he was anarchist, syndicalist, Bolshevik, Left Oppositionist, prisoner and refugee. Serge's experiences in the Soviet Union and international communist movement form the basis of his political and literary writings. Serge was a committed writer with a novelist's eye for detail and penetrating description. The dissertation begins with Serge's arrival in his never seen homeland. Born Victor Lvovich Kibalchich in Belgian exile to Russian narodniki parents, Serge was drawn to the land of the first socialist revolution, the country of his roots and his language. He arrived as an anarcho-bolshevik with two prison terms and a failed insurrection behind him. In the next twenty years, Serge participated in the Bolshevik party, the Comintern, and the Left Opposition. He was sent to Germany on Comintern assignment, where he participated in the aborted revolution of October 1923, and edited the French language edition of Inprecor . He was a rank-and-file militant of the Leningrad Left opposition, though on intimate terms with its leaders. Like most of the `revolutionary generation of Bolsheviks', he endured imprisonment and deportation. Unlike them, Serge was saved from certain death through an international campaign of pressure for his release. Though Serge was expelled from the USSR in 1936, he did not end his association with it: he spent the remainder of his life contemplating and acting upon his experience in the disfigured revolution. This thesis investigates Serge's critique of the Soviet Union through his life and works. We follow his political associations and relations, record his analysis and draw out his insights. Serge's mature reflections on the Soviet Union and the world are seen through a comprehensive study of his experiences and writings from the twenties and thirties in the Soviet Union and in European exile. The aim of this work is to establish Victor Serge as a contemporary thinker, a man whose life spans the tumultous struggles of the first half of the twentieth century, while his ideas speak to the problems humanity faces on the eve of the twenty-first. His largely unpublished or out of print work addresses the key theoretical problems of Soviet society as well as the impact that society has had on the world struggle for socialism. Victor Serge considered the Soviet system under Stalin an anti-human, totalitarian bureaucratic society with collectivist tendencies, that was neither socialist nor capitalist. It could only establish itself through a bloody counter-revolution which killed millions while retaining the language of socialism. The new system was inherently unstable and in permanent conflict with its own people. It is this legacy that the Soviet Union today is attempting to reform. Serge's analysis is at times uneven, though his thinking is fresh, and scrupulously honest. Serge is seen as the historian of the Left Opposition, an instinctive, unorthodox and non-sectarian Marxist who retained his dignity and optimism for a socialist future, through the darkest decades of defeats.",301519788,,Dissertations & Theses," Weissman, S.C.WeissmanS.C.Weissman, S.C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756196341 , 44382351 , 101309 , U031077 , U031077", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301519788?accountid=14496, 0314 Slavic literature, 0314 Slavic literature, 0314 Slavic literature,, 0314 Slavic literature, Slavic literature," (UMI)AAIU031077 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Victor+Serge%3A++political%2C+social+and+literary+critic+of+the+USSR%2C+1919-1947%3B++the+reflections+and+activities+of+a+Belgo-Russian+revolutionary+caught+in+the+orbit+of+Soviet+political+history.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weissman%2C+S.C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3420,Progress and apocalypse: Science and the end of the modern world. (Volumes I and II),"Since the 1930s, ecology has helped generate both scientific, religious, and popular prophecies of the collapse of civilization and the extinction of humanity. After World War II, scientists such as William Vogt, Rachel Carson, Barry Commoner, and Paul Ehrlich used the science of ecology to forecast the end of the modern world and the extinction of humanity. I argue that these apocalyptic ecologists are part of a larger social movement that is challenging the social and political structure of the modern world. Ecological apocalyptic scientists are struggling to replace the authority of progress and economic growth with the authority of ecology. Their apocalypticism grew out of the contradiction between technological and industrial progress and modern science's biological understanding of the Earth. These scientist-writers use a shared apocalyptic rhetoric and ecological world view to call for a popular crusade to save nature and humanity. This scientific apocalypticism helped undermine faith in progress and the modern world. By developing a biological history that challenged the human-centered history of the modern world, their writings ignited public opposition to progress. Apocalyptic ecologists helped form a post-war environmental coalition between conservationists, scientists, and an informed public. Using the authority of science and ecology and the threat of the end of the modern world, environmentalists developed a scientific and political critique of modern industrial society. They believed that unless global industrial civilization transformed its understanding and use of the natural world, it would collapse and humanity would be threatened with extinction. Ecological apocalyptics made ecology both a science and politics of human survival.",303907610,,Dissertations & Theses," Lewis, ChristopherLewisChristopherLewis, Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746919951 , 30873541 , 66569 , 9127739 , 9127739", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303907610?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0585 Science history"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0585 Science history"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0585 Science history",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0585 Science history"," American studies , American history , Science history"," Social sciences , environmentalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Progress+and+apocalypse%3A+Science+and+the+end+of+the+modern+world.+%28Volumes+I+and+II%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lewis%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3421,"Artists respond to the Great Depression and the threat of Fascism: The New York Artists' Union and its magazine ""Art Front"" (1934-1937)","Art and politics could not avoid each other during the Great Depression and the rise of fascism, in the 1930s. Social realism, which had been limited to drawings in radical magazines or the graphic arts, became important in painting and sculpture. Artists in the John Reed Club, the Artists' Union, the Harlem Artists' Guild, and the American Artists' Congress Against War and Fascism drew a wide range of supporters and acted as pressure groups, influencing society. The New Deal's Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, which employed a total of 5,300 artists over a period of eight years and had a profound impact on American art, was started largely and continued by the pressure of artists and artists organizations. The Artists' Union, the official bargaining agent between government and the artist, negotiated wages, hours, and working conditions, and kept artists employed as artists, amid threats of closure, ""quality control,"" favoritism, racism, censorship, and selected layoffs. Between 1933-1938, at least three factors favored the artists: in a near crisis situation, the government was impelled to act on artists' solutions to solve their unemployment; the labor movement, aided by New Deal legislation, became insurgent, and provided a role model and support for artists; and all shades of the cultural liberal and left-wing--who would be totally disaffected from each other in the near future--worked together on common goals. Commonality was influenced by radical politics and an idealistic view of working-class--its solidarity, collectivity, and readiness to take action. Engage artists viewed the solving of artists problems in global terms, and with Popular Front ideas, worked with fraternal artists' organizations in Europe and Mexico. A window to this radical shift in artists' subject matter, patronage, and position in American society, is the unique art magazine Art Front. Challenging entrenched hierarchies in analytical writings, indignant drawings, and documentary photographs, it was vital and provocative, stemming from the realistic character of the Artists' Union, which sponsored it.",303931658,,Dissertations & Theses," Tyler, FrancineTylerFrancineTyler, Francine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746445401 , 31160551 , 66569 , 9124769 , 9124769", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303931658?accountid=14496," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history",," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," Fine Arts , American studies , American history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Artists+respond+to+the+Great+Depression+and+the+threat+of+Fascism%3A+The+New+York+Artists%27+Union+and+its+magazine+%22Art+Front%22+%281934-1937%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tyler%2C+Francine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3422,Information cultures and the transformation of communist societies: The case of the Soviet Union,"This dissertation is motivated by the belief that the creation of an information culture will be fundamental to the quality of the economic future of the Soviet Union, and its ability to compete internationally in the economic marketplace, regardless of its future configuration. Two major influences have acted as catalysts for the systemic transformations that have occurred since 1985. First, the global information revolution has been an important influence in the determination of new goals for the Soviet system. Second, a ""perceptual revolution"" preceded this era of change, instigated by the Soviet academic intelligentsia, which has made political, social, and economic change not only possible in the Soviet context, but inevitable. To varying degrees, the three prerequisites necessary for the creation of a Soviet information culture already exist. First, a civil society is emerging to take the place of a failed official ideology, manifest in the movement towards democratization and individuation, and the revival of ethnic cleavages. The demand for political accountability by these three major forces of change contributed significantly to the destruction of the traditional communist ideology. Second, a sound economic infrastructure is essential to informationalization. Presently, the Soviet economic infrastructure is strong, but continues to rely too heavily on industrial production, and economic performance is constrained by poor levels of worker productivity. And third, human and technical capabilities are necessary to achieve the new goals of the system. Unsuccessful Soviet educational reform, and inadequate computerization of the economy continue to slow the reform process. Based upon an analysis of these three prerequisites vital to the formation of a Soviet information culture, the following conclusions can be made: (1) before any future steps can be taken, a stable political leadership, accountable to the people, must emerge; (2) general societal attitudes toward informationalization beneficial to the creation of an information culture must be encouraged; (3) a risk-oriented culture must take the place of the traditionally risk-averse Soviet political culture; and (4) the intelligentsia will continue to play an important role as major contributors to future plans for reform and informationalization.",303944510,,Dissertations & Theses," Bellows, Heather E.BellowsE.HeatherBellows, Heather E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745693561 , 31164271 , 66569 , 9214112 , 9214112", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303944510?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," International law , International relations", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Information+cultures+and+the+transformation+of+communist+societies%3A+The+case+of+the+Soviet+Union&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bellows%2C+Heather+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3423,Union justice: A longitudinal case study of labor litigation,"The dissertation offers a fifty year longitudinal study of litigation encountered and promoted by the International Woodworkers of America with some comparative studies of litigation by its major rival. This study is designed to create a picture of everyday legal practices from which to assess the strategic consequences of labor regulation for labor organizations, and to speculate on the importance of litigation activity for the growth of the labor law. Major findings indicate a strong and growing reliance on litigation by the union leadership but with a changing historical focus from more short term to longer term strategic considerations. These changing forms of practice are understood as dependent on the nature of inter-union competition and the relative ability of organized labor to elicit working class identification with the institutional forms of the labor movement. The dissertation argues against theories which understand the importance of labor law to organizational and working class strength to lie either with the ideological subversion of labor union leadership or the economic inefficiency of labor regulation. The case study is presented from the context of social jurisprudence which is reviewed in Chapter Two. Chapter Three reviews theories of labor's institutional and organizational development. Chapters Four and Five present the historical analysis of the unions' litigation activity.

It focuses on the southeastern coastal municipio of Guayama, the island's third leading sugar-and-slavery district in the nineteenth century. The study analyzes Guayaman society at the end of slavery, and emphasizes the heavily Afro-Puerto Rican character of its popular classes, and the European character of its elite. Thus, the work raises new questions on traditional conceptualizations of the racial configuration of nineteenth-century Puerto Rican society. The economic decline of the region's sugar industry is analyzed, but I stress an examination of the ex-slaves' efforts to define their freedom, and the planters' only partially successful efforts to determine the character of the transition to free labor. A detailed study of the dismal record of ex-slaves' (libertos) attempts to become peasants is presented. Local geographic conditions, the scarcity of arable land, and the structural weakness of free peasants and pre-emancipation proto-peasant slave experiences help to explain the libertos' failure to become peasants after emancipation. Guayama's libertos, however, put a premium on their freedom of movement. Mobility within and beyond municipio borders, to the urban township, and to different plantations is examined as planters tried to restrict this central aspect of emancipation. The study also explores elite attempts to maintain social hierarchies and cultural restrictions from the days of slavery. It concludes with a brief examination of forms of conflict and solidarity by looking at the rash of plantation fires registered after emancipation, especially in the 1880s. In short, this dissertation attempts to show that structural analyses of the transition that focus primarily on factors such as land/labor ratios, larger international economic imperatives, colonial labor legislation, or alleged capitalist planter objectives fail to grasp the complexities of emancipation. That a peasantization process failed, or that libertos did not withdraw from plantation work on a large scale, does not necessarily imply ex-slave acquiescence to planter ambitions, nor the absence of diverse efforts by the libertos to define emancipation on their own terms.",303956478,,Dissertations & Theses," Figueroa, Luis AntonioFigueroaAntonioLuisFigueroa, Luis Antonio", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746495221 , 31377411 , 66569 , 9209305 , 9209305", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303956478?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0328 Black history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0328 Black history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0328 Black history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0328 Black history"," Latin American history , Black history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Facing+freedom%3A+The+transition+from+slavery+to+free+labor+in+Guayama%2C+Puerto+Rico%2C+1860-1898&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Figueroa%2C+Luis+Antonio&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3425,REMNANTS OF AN UNWELCOME PAST: THE EXISTENCE OF NEO-NATIONAL SOCIALISM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY,"The thesis developed directly from an interest in the issue of terrorism and political violence, as studied for my MA degree. In the case of the Federal Republic of Germany politically motivated violence has seemed almost exclusively, judging from published material, to have left-wing origins, as in the case of the Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Faction) and the Revolutionare Zellen (Revolutionary Cells). This thesis sets out, however, to examine the existence of terrorism from the right and to assess its significance. The thesis has been divided into eight chapters. It begins by looking at the existence of right-wing extremism. Chapter one examines the potential sympathy amongst the West German electorate for right-wing extremist sentiment. Chapter two traces the development and history of organised right-wing extremism from 1945 to 1990 and shows that the rise of the Republikaner in 1989 marked the third ascent of right-wing extremism in the FRG. Subsequent chapters focus on the adherents of neo-National Socialism as it is from this area, for the most part, the right-wing acts of violence emanate. Chapter three investigates the rise of neo-Nazism at the end of the 1970s and traces its development, its leaders, membership and international connections. The fourth chapter illustrates the objectives of the neo-Nazis by examining the ideology behind it. Chapter five focuses on the issue of right-wing terrorism and argues that the violence from the right represents a more serious threat to public order than is imagined. Chapter six seeks to explain the appeal of neo-Nazism and provides an account of the social composition of neo-Nazism while the seventh chapter examines the political and judicial reaction to the existence of the neo-Nazi movement. Finally, the last chapter pulls all the above strands together to present a picture of neo-Nazism at the beginning of the 1990s and assesses its position in the newly united Germany.",303986894,,Dissertations & Theses," MCGOWAN, IVOR LEEMCGOWANLEEIVORMCGOWAN, IVOR LEE", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745163111 , 31188441 , 66569 , DX94908 , DX94908", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303986894?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology"," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology"," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology",," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology"," Social structure , Criminology", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=REMNANTS+OF+AN+UNWELCOME+PAST%3A+THE+EXISTENCE+OF+NEO-NATIONAL+SOCIALISM+IN+THE+FEDERAL+REPUBLIC+OF+GERMANY&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MCGOWAN%2C+IVOR+LEE&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3426,"NATURE CONSERVATION IN SPAIN: THE INFLUENCE OF PRESSURE GROUPS AND VESTED INTERESTS IN THE ESTADO DE AUTONOMIAS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO EXTREMADURA. (VOLUMES I AND II)","Conservation of nature in Spain began with measures to protect hunting and timber. Liberal interludes of the last century concentrated land into fewer hands, destroying much of the country's forest. A corps of forestry technocrats--the ingenieros de montes--grew up, with a first interest in production with an emphasis in this century on reafforestation with rapid-growth, introduced species, serving to exacerbate rather than check erosion, along with other deleterious social and environmental effects. ICONA has, since its creation in 1971 been dominated by the technocrats. Awareness of conservation issues on the part of the general public was heightened by the growth of the conservation movement, in spite of its failure to become organised on a national scale. Devolution has led to some successes in conservation of habitats, after learning the lessons from extensive campaigns such as that which saved Monfrague, one of the world's great natural areas. However, the process of devolution had not been fully implemented as Spain prepared for EEC entry, with far-reaching effects, mostly because of the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy and other structural funds. Paradoxically, whilst the CAP is posing some of the major threats to Spain's natural environment, European legislation and other initiatives may be beginning to provide the means of protection in the face of increased pressures. To ensure an adequate protection for Spain's fragile ecosystems the conservation movement must develop a national structure to compensate for regional fragmentation and to face up to a new European dimension. Pressure must be maintained to ensure integrated regional planning policies, to be coordinated on a European level, so that the CAP and other measures might be adapted to the special nature of Spain's wildlife. Failure to do this will mean desertification and international recriminations, because of the Peninsula's importance for migrating wildlife. Such an integrated policy must ensure the harmony of regional populations with agricultural systems to ensure correct and rational use of natural resources. The work concentrates on the area of Extremadura, arguably one on Europe's richest wildlife areas. It is a region outstanding for the harmonisation of agricultural practices with wildlife protection, and the vast areas of oak groves, supporting an agro-sylvo-pastoral system of agricultural exploitation, in conjunction with virtually Mediterranean climax forest, makes it unique, and increases the need to ensure its protection from a variety of threats and pressures.",303989146,,Dissertations & Theses," BANGS, PAUL R.BANGSR.PAULBANGS, PAUL R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744670371 , 30873151 , 66569 , DX97431 , DX97431", Dissertation/Thesis, 1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303989146?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0617 Public administration , 0768 Environmental science"," 0366 Geography , 0617 Public administration , 0768 Environmental science"," 0366 Geography , 0617 Public administration , 0768 Environmental science",," 0366 Geography , 0617 Public administration , 0768 Environmental science"," Geography , Public administration , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=NATURE+CONSERVATION+IN+SPAIN%3A+THE+INFLUENCE+OF+PRESSURE+GROUPS+AND+VESTED+INTERESTS+IN+THE+ESTADO+DE+AUTONOMIAS%2C+WITH+SPECIAL+REFERENCE+TO+EXTREMADURA.+%28VOLUMES+I+AND+II%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=BANGS%2C+PAUL+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3427,"The impact of the french revolution in the ideas and policies of william pitt, 1789-1795","This work addresses the Younger Pitt's response to the French Revolution from 1789-1795. Government records, the personal papers of Pitt and his contemporaries and the proceedings of Parliament have been examined to trace the development of Pitt's thought and its expression in Britain's foreign and domestic policy. In contrast to many members of the British social elite, Pitt saw events in France during the laste 1780 and early 1790s in conventional terms; the following years of Revolutionary War consequently witnessed no intellectual or practical discontinuity in comparison to the previous decade.Pitt entered office in 1784 with no experience in the field of international relations. By the late 1780s, his thoughts had been formed in a practical context and predisposed him to regard overseas developments in a pragmatic light. The complacence he had derived from the decline of French power throughout the late 1780s gave him the confidence to launch a series of global military offensives that failed through a fundamental misunderstanding of allied objectives and of the Revolution itself. Pitt never saw France in strictly ideological terms, which made him relatively flexible about its post-war political settlement but traditional war aims respecting the Continent and colonies made him uncompromising about the condition for peace. Populare political activism was regarded as a threat to social or political order only at certain critical moments. The popularisation of politics was, to Pitt, directed from Paris at specific diplomatic goals which, in 1792, comprised neutrality and, from 1793 to 1795, constituted withdrawal from the war. His gradual implementation of repressive measures was ultimately determined by the seeming strength of popular unrest but Pitt realised that the official condemnation of the popular political movement carried executive action into unconstitutional realms. His adherence to the `liberal' political creed of Augustan England places him within the tradition of eighteenth century Whiggism, if not it Pantheon.",301442758,,Dissertations & Theses," Mori, Jennifer C.MoriC.JenniferMori, Jennifer C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756312521 , 44410581 , 101309 , U042652 , U042652", Dissertation/Thesis, 1992,, English, English,,1992,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301442758?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU042652 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+the+french+revolution+in+the+ideas+and+policies+of+william+pitt%2C+1789-1795&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mori%2C+Jennifer+C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3428,The Farmer - Dominant Study Group: a practical paradigm in international extension strategy.,"The Farmer-Dominant Study Group (FDSG) paradigm is tested against the hypothesis that it offers a practical means of achieving technical agricultural progress, delivering cost-effective and socio-psychologically sound extension, and contributing constructively to the social cohesion between working family farmers for the benefit of rural communities. FDSG allows for a logical linkage between farmers, researchers and extensionists for Farming Systems Development (FSD). The FDSG MODEL is distinguished as beginning with farmer dominance, served by appropriate catalyst/lubricant extensionist involvement. Its focus is on study together using methodical monitoring management (MMM) whereby physical and financial parameters are compared on normal farm crops, with some on-farm research (OFR) and subsequent Farming Systems Development. Beneficial group characteristics result from such study, producing strong mutuality. This leads on to the full realisation of farmer-dominance, expressed through the integrated realism characteristic of farmers worldwide. The FDSG model is found to be transferrable, with adjustment, to other agroecological contexts. Evidence is drawn from:- i) the UK case of the Cirencester Cereal Study Group (CCSG) and its linkages, particularly to the Arable Research Centres (ARC), using participant-observer research with a devised group assessment procedure involving 55 farmers, a farmers' own evaluation involving 27 farmers, and a comparative survey of 173 farmer-members of ARC, ii) the comparative case of the Africa Cooperative Action Trust (ACAT) Club movement in Transkei, Ciskei, Kwazulu and Swaziland, by questioning:- 26 Southern African farmers, 71 ACAT Clubs (FDSG) and 40 ACAT extensionists; plus support from a survey of 145 Nigerian farmers, ii) preliminary work among farmers and extensionists in India, iv) the international literature.

Meyer (1847-1929).,"F.B. Meyer (1847-1929) was one of the most prominent Free Church ministers of his period. He had a number of successful ministries, in which he gave priority to work as an evangelist rather than a pastor, an emphasis which owed much to the decisive influence of the American revivalist D.L. Moody. Meyer's theology was essentially devotional, and he was able to relate to different doctrinal perspectives within Evangelicalism. In ecclesiology he was transdenominational, although he was also a notable Baptist figure and was committed to the Baptist doctrine of believer's baptism. His pietistic sympathies and his undenominationalism found expression in the holiness movement associated with the Keswick convention, of which he became the foremost international spokesman. He was also the leading Nonconformist in his movement, which was predominantly Anglican. Meyer's ability to combine other-worldly forms of spirituality with an equal dedication to local and national socio-political activity - in such areas as temperance, social purity, education and the rights of pacifists - enabled him to function as the leader who most effectively bridged the diverse elements in British Evangelicalism from the 1880s to the First World War. By the 1920s Meyer's expansive vision for the Free Churches was receding and the focus of his energy moved to the advocacy of premillennialism. In this period he associated more closely with those on the Fundamentalist wing of Evangelicalism and the fact that Britain did not experience the kind of Fundamentalist schism which took place in America was due in part to Meyer's reconciling influence. Comparatively little scholarly work has been done on the signifiance of Meyer. This study of his career should give an insight into crucial developments which took place, from the 1870s to the 1920s, in British Evangelicalism.",301511220,,Dissertations & Theses," Randall, I.M.RandallI.M.Randall, I.M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756386331 , 44426931 , 101309 , U039214 , U039214", Dissertation/Thesis, 1992,, English, English,,1992,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301511220?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology,, 0469 Theology, Theology," (UMI)AAIU039214 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+career+of+F.B.+Meyer+%281847-1929%29.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Randall%2C+I.M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3430,The origins and development of English language teaching in China,"Since China's open-door policy and reform movement began in 1979, English language teaching (ELT) has developed tremendously to meet the needs of China's international interactions with the world. English is becoming so popular that China is now the host of the largest English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom in the world, largest meaning that among the countries where English is not the native or official language, China has the largest number of EFL students. However, little research has been done on issues regarding the development of EFL in China, such as when and how did ELT start? Who sponsored ELT at each stage of its development? Why is English so popular these days? How has it developed to its current status? This dissertation attempts to explain these issues and to account for the forces that have driven ELT into its current being in China. If anything, this writing is, first of all, a historical account of ELT development in China, which is so far the first of its kind written in English. The dissertation falls into five parts. Chapter I functions as an introduction to the writing, and lays out some background information. Chapter II focuses on the early stages of ELT in China (1830-1900), including the missionary activities and the Chinese efforts in ELT. Chapter III takes a look at the ELT activities and development in the newly founded public schools in China in the first half of the century (1900-1950). This was the period in which some master English teachers had been prepared, and foundation laid for later development. Chapter IV describes the ups and downs of English (1950-1978), how it lost to the Russian language and how it was politicalized during the years of the Cultural Revolution. And the last chapter, Chapter V, tries to capture and present some highlights of the English language resurgence to its highest popularity in the 1980s, and attempts an analysis of the social, economic factors that helped push forward the enterprise of ELT. It concludes by looking ahead at the development of ELT in the 1990s.",303964266,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, XiaopingWangXiaopingWang, Xiaoping", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746241701 , 19622991 , 66569 , 9218724 , 9218724", Dissertation/Thesis, 1992,, English, English,,1992,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303964266?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0279 Language arts , 0332 History"," 0520 Education history , 0279 Language arts , 0332 History"," 0520 Education history , 0279 Language arts , 0332 History",," 0520 Education history , 0279 Language arts , 0332 History"," Education history , Language arts , History"," Social sciences , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+origins+and+development+of+English+language+teaching+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Xiaoping&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3431,"""The work of democracy"": Ralph Bunche, Kenneth B. Clark, Lorraine Hansberry and the cultural politics of racial equality","This dissertation uses the public lives of three African-American intellectuals who became postwar ""role models"" of racial equality--United Nations diplomat Ralph Bunche, social scientist Kenneth B. Clark and playwright Lorraine Hansberry--to explore the cultural understandings and tensions which underlay the American ""coming-of-age"" on race. By following the rise and decline of the symbolic currency of each of these individuals, I chronicle the evolution of the American discourse on race from the era of Jackie Robinson to the emergence of ""Black Power."" In the late forties and early fifties, Bunche personified for many Americans the relationship that existed between domestic progress on racial equality and the objectives of Cold War foreign policy abroad. During the height of his celebrity Bunche also symbolized the great popular hope that the U.N. might finally redeem the unrealized promise of Wilsonian internationalism. As the civil rights movement was hitting its stride, Clark became the best known ""expert-interpreter"" of racial issues to the American public. Clark's close association with Brown v. Board launched him as important advocate of school ""integration"" while his authorship of Dark Ghetto established him as one of the foremost authorities on the ""American Dilemma"" as represented by the northern urban ghetto. Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun was, to its admirers, a final frame in the cultural narrative of the ""ethnic arrival"" of African-Americans. Through that play, however, Hansberry sought to accomplish something considerably more audacious: to reintroduce the entanglement of race and class as a subject of the American discourse on race. She further argued that ""American Negroes"" were, in fact, ""African-Americans,"" and that their struggle for ""civil rights"" was one branch of the global anti-colonial movement. I examine the experiences of these three ""participant-symbols"" of racial equality to illuminate the way in which the ""common meanings"" they put forward challenged existing understandings regarding individualism, democracy, and equality. This study attends as well to the ways in which existing cultural patterns impeded the establishment of these new values--what Martin Luther King, Jr., described as the ""work of democracy.""",303987573,,Dissertations & Theses," Keppel, Ben GarethKeppelGarethBenKeppel, Ben Gareth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745981341 , 19110721 , 66569 , 9310922 , 9310922", Dissertation/Thesis, 1992,, English, English,,1992,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303987573?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0304 Biographies"," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0304 Biographies"," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0304 Biographies",," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0304 Biographies"," American history , Black history , American studies , Biographies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Bunche, Ralph , Clark, Kenneth B.@ , Hansberry, Lorraine , role models",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22The+work+of+democracy%22%3A+Ralph+Bunche%2C+Kenneth+B.+Clark%2C+Lorraine+Hansberry+and+the+cultural+politics+of+racial+equality&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Keppel%2C+Ben+Gareth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3432,Organizing for internationalism: A study of the educational mission of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A.,"This study is an exploration of the organizational processes through which an innovative ideology may become institutionalized. It focuses on the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. as an ideological organization advocating ""internationalism."" Participant observation, interviewing, and archival research methods are used to investigate the relationship between ideology and organization in a large chapter and at the national headquarters of UNA-USA. Social science literature often presents ideological organizations as tools for the dissemination of an already coherent ideology or as pluralistic arenas for the pursuit of multiple non-ideological goals. On the basis of this research, I argue for an alternative image of ideological organizations as crucibles for ideological change. The internationalism of UNA-USA is revealed to be an unstable combination of two different sets of beliefs. One, originating in religious reform movements of the late 1800's, is a ""universal humanism."" The other, represented by a small number of government and corporate leaders, is an ""enlightened self-interest"" relating the national interest to increased cooperation in international organizations. The commonalties and contradictions of these two internationalisms have been played out in the organizational history of UNA-USA. A new ""multilateralism"" has recently emerged from the organization, synthesizing the two earlier perspectives. Ideology, organization, and politics are each examined in this study, and linked in an analytical model of institutionalization as a political process of organizational and ideological change. Individuals and groups within the ideological organization are seen engaged in a continuous process of political contest and negotiation regarding both the nature of their beliefs and the organizational requirements for the advocacy of those beliefs. This process of negotiation generates a changing ideological discourse.",303998747,,Dissertations & Theses," Uljee, Leslie FlumUljeeFlumLeslieUljee, Leslie Flum", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746762021 , 19459301 , 66569 , 9317404 , 9317404", Dissertation/Thesis, 1992,, English, English,,1992,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303998747?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0515 Education"," 0626 Sociology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0515 Education"," 0626 Sociology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0515 Education",," 0626 Sociology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0515 Education"," Sociology , International law , International relations , Education"," Social sciences , Education , United Nations Association of the U.S.A.@",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Organizing+for+internationalism%3A+A+study+of+the+educational+mission+of+the+United+Nations+Association+of+the+U.S.A.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Uljee%2C+Leslie+Flum&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3433,Internationalism and its betrayal: From Grotius to Hegel,"In this thesis, I explore the development of internationalism from the disintegration of the catholic commonwealth to the congress of Vienna. The internal contradictions of internationalism led to its decline, and to the rise of nationalism. Internationalism was developed by the rising middle-class against the catholic respublica's false claim of universality. It expressed the increased self-awareness of a group, the Third Estate, seeking international solidarity against the particularism of Absolutist regimes. Internationalism included new principles of moral, political and economic rights. It was applicable to both individuals within and between states, compatible with the spirit of free enterprise, able to free the realm of knowledge from christian tutelage, and to expand the political and property rights of the Third Estate. The development of internationalism, however, as conceived by the ascending middle-class, engendered contradictions inherent to the pre-capitalist period of the eighteenth century. The French Revolution, the apex of internationalist ideals, raised hopes but did not lead to European unity or the universalization of human rights principles. The history of the nineteenth century illustrates that the principle of social justice, as espoused by internationalism during the French Revolution, could not be reconciled with the new emerging economic order. The idea of internationalism receded or rather was superseded by the development of nationalism. The Napoleonic conquests veiled the interest of the bourgeoisie and incubated the burst of nationalist movements in 1848. The idea of internationalism, as conceptualized by the thinkers of the rising middle class, incorporates particularist forces which manifest themselves as nationalism during critical periods.

The second part of the thesis analyzes the movements which sought to establish a modem art style in the Islamic world that would confirm a national artistic identity. It follows the different art movements which undertook this quest that eventually led to the development of the contemporary Calligraphic School of Art. It discloses the factors and artists which induced its inception. It establishes the main styles and various branches of the modem Calligraphic School of Art, including in-depth analysis and critique of each style, sub-style and its adherents.

The research starts out from the basic ontological proposition that although material space exists as a `thing', it is nonetheless a complex social process, subject to change and constantly changing. Under capitalism, it is a process which must be comprehended dialectically since it is constituted by conflictual practices which are themselves part of an internally-related global capitalist system. I argue that by laying bare the dialectics of space - theorising the diverse processes involved in its creation and transformation - we can begin to grasp place as constituting the form of one moment of a broader dialectical process. To explore and formulate a framework toward the construction of this `new object' for human geography, the thesis adopts and develops the materialist dialectic to probe and reconstruct the interconnected processes that command space and shape the urban landscape in particular places. By using actual research findings from two concrete case studies of socio-spatial change in the cities of Baltimore, U.S.A, and Liverpool, England, the analysis invokes dialectics as a way of gaining knowledge of capitalist spatiality. This viewpoint challenges the Cartesian foundation of much urban and geographical research and has important implications for developing critical theoretical understandings of contemporary urban change. It also raises vital political questions about local democracy, and of the empowerment of place-bound groups as they struggle against the exclusionary and pulverising tendencies of this particular phase of capitalist urbanisation. I assert that the method of gaining knowledge must be dialectical in character, and that the movement of space under capitalism is itself dialectical. And these two dialectics are one and the same.

After discussing Western interpretation and understanding of Islamic art, a brief comparative study is made of Islamic and Western aesthetics which includes differences and similarities between the two perceptions. The art of calligraphy is traced and evaluated and shown to be the only one among the different art forms in Islamic culture which has survived atrophy. The main part of the thesis is concerned with the decline of Islamic art forms in the Ottoman Empire and under the Safavid Dynasty, since the sixteenth century. It analyzes the political, economic and social factors that had caused the decline while simultaneously led to the penetration of Western cultural trends in the Islamic world. The history of development of Western art styles, in each of the Islamic countries in the Middle East and North Africa including Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Tunis, Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Palestine, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, is traced after a brief historical and social background. The main artistic trends are analyzed, citing the artists that have brought them about, with illustrations of their works. The last part of the thesis establishes the inception of the contemporary calligraphic school of art in the Arab world and Iran, with mention of Turkey. It cites the factors that have induced it, the first artists who started it and its subject matters. It establishes its three main styles, with their various branches, including in-depth analysis and critique of each main style as well as sub-style, including the artists who propagate it, and giving illustrated examples. The placement of the calligraphic school of art, in painting, sculpture and ceramics, within the international art movement, is also mooted.

An epilogue considers their reactions during the last months of 1914 and tests whether the outbreak of war caused their opinions to change. Throughout the peace the workers were subjected to propaganda from both the right and the left. This propaganda has been studied before but the difficult problem of establishing how the workers reacted to it remains. It is here that this thesis seeks to make an original contribution. Part One looks at the efforts of the National Service League to persuade the working class to accept universal military training and considers why, although a few workers became enthusiastic supporters, the majority remained hostile. The debate between the League and the organised labour movement is also examined. Part Two studies the propaganda of the socialists and reveals its limited appeal to the working class. It highlights the differences of opinion between Keir Hardie, H.M. Hyndman and Robert Blatchford; charts the progress of the proposal for an international strike against war; examines the record of the anti-military campaigns conducted by the Independent Labour Party; and follows the campaign for a citizen army of the Social Democratic Federation. The favourable attitude of armaments workers and their representatives towards military and naval expenditure is demonstrated. In addition, the question of the food supply in time of war is studied from the working class perspective. Part Three investigates the relationship between the working class and the regular army. It looks at the organisation and activities of the recruiting service and the background and motives of would-be recruits. It examines popular prejudice against the army, soldiers and enlistment and studies the effect on working class attitudes of the use of the military during trades disputes.",301559804,,Dissertations & Theses," Croucher, B.C.CroucherB.C.Croucher, B.C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756952351 , 44473811 , 101309 , U046301 , U046301", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301559804?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU046301 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=British+working+class+attitudes+to+war+and+national+defence%2C+1902-1914.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Croucher%2C+B.C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3439,"Conceptions of politics, morality, and war in the nuclear policy debates","During the resurgent nuclear debates from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, analysts sharply disagreed about the appropriate means and ends of strategy. Deterrence dominance strategists argued that America required a countervailing capacity to sustain a viable deterrent posture and to contain Soviet adventurism. Proponents of pure deterrence claimed that the risks endemic to mutual vulnerability would suffice to moderate the superpower rivalry. Advocates of denuclearization charged that reliance on nuclear weaponry posed the greatest danger to human well-being and called for diplomatic measures to establish a disarmament regime. While scholars have systemically explored the strategic and technological components of the controversy, few studies have examined the political theoretic dimensions. Through a textual exegesis of the writings of key participants, this work seeks to demonstrate that contending conceptions of politics and morality inform dissension about the viability of coercive power in the nuclear age. Justifications of deterrence dominance proposals generally conflate political and ethical considerations through variants of Hobbesian skepticism or liberal just war interventionism. Such arguments perceive the state as the locus of societal values and sovereignty as sanctioning extensive activities in the global system. Pure deterrence notions posit an irreconcilable tension between politics and morality that corresponds with a tragic vision: war may be a necessary element of sociality, but it seldom has truly creative consequences. From this perspective, the state is a morally ambiguous agent that can preserve and endanger societal well-being. Finally, associated with the denuclearization school is a conviction that progressive social movements can conform politics to essential ethical precepts by minimizing the role of coercive power. In this view, the state and its claim to sovereignty are primary sources of the war system, hence must be radically altered through comprehensive democratization.",304029812,,Dissertations & Theses," Ware, Lucy ClarkeWareClarkeLucyWare, Lucy Clarke", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746513181 , 27016151 , 66569 , 9316082 , 9316082", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304029812?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science"," International law , International relations , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conceptions+of+politics%2C+morality%2C+and+war+in+the+nuclear+policy+debates&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ware%2C+Lucy+Clarke&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3440,"Immigrant culture and the politics of identity: Italian-American syndicalists in the United States, 1911-1927","This dissertation focuses on the nexus between political and social history in the lives of Italian-American syndicalists in the early twentieth century. My analysis of debates, both within the Italian Socialist Federation, the central vehicle for Italian immigrant radicalism in the years before World War I, and among those leading members who later left the organization--on strategy and ideology, on gender, race, and regional differences, and on the relevance of continuing ties to Italy--sheds light on the process by which political and cultural identities are repeatedly constructed and reconstructed. Methodologically, I examine Italian-American syndicalists and their ideology in a transnational context, exploring their political activism both in the United States and in Italy. Using Italian-language newspapers, essays and correspondence from archives in both countries, I analyze the relationship of these radicals to their homeland on a number of levels: in terms of cultural retention; their reaction to events in their country of origin; their exchanges of philosophical and strategic advice with radicals in Italy; and their physical movement back and forth between countries. The importance of the continuing and complex connections between an ethnic group and its homeland is just beginning to receive attention from immigrant historians. The assumption underpinning much of the current work in this field is that both the culture of origin and the mainstream United States culture were static entities. I show instead that there was an ongoing dynamic interplay between the cultures, and identify how this interplay shaped immigrant identity in continually shifting ways. I also suggest ways in which working-class and radical history in the United States need to be revised. This study complements and extends the work done by scholars on the ""new unionism"" and on ethnic radicalism in two ways. First, it emphasizes the centrality of Italian-American syndicalists in the prewar labor and radical movements, specifically in the struggles waged by the Industrial Workers of the World. Second, it traces the enduring influence of immigrant syndicalism in mainstream unions like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America after the end of World War I and the demise of the IWW.",304044763,,Dissertations & Theses," Topp, Michael Arthur MillerToppArthur MillerMichaelTopp, Michael Arthur Miller", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745249831 , 26959921 , 66569 , 9407052 , 9407052", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304044763?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0578 History",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," American studies , American history , History"," Social sciences , Italian Americans , identity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Immigrant+culture+and+the+politics+of+identity%3A++Italian-American+syndicalists+in+the+United+States%2C+1911-1927&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Topp%2C+Michael+Arthur+Miller&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3441,"""The weapons of our warfare are not carnal"": Civil War pacifism, perfectionism, and roots of post-war radicalism","This study concerns pacifism in the northern states during the Civil War era and its connection with post-war radicalism. It focuses on an eclectic group of perfectionist pacifists who opposed the war on the basis of their religious convictions, which stemmed from their views on Christian perfection, the Government of God, and the millennium. Believing God's laws supreme over laws of human origin, the perfectionists refused to support or take part in the Federal government's war effort because God's laws demanded that they reject all violence, even if positive results may result from its use. Having experienced ridicule, accusations of treason, ostracism, and the specter of conscription during the war, the perfectionist pacifists united in its wake to create the Universal Peace Union (UPU). Through the UPU the perfectionists strove to convince the rest of humanity to recognize God's laws as the highest source of authority and to bring their governments into conformity with God's laws. They envisioned a day when all nations subordinated themselves to the Government of God, creating a ""universal republic"" of nations. Once accomplished, they posited, all evils, including international strife, would cease to exist. The pacifists' quest for a perfect world led them to expand their activities to a wide variety of issues within the United States such as Reconstruction, Native American policy, labor relations, education reform, and equal rights among others. In an era when American society and American reformers grew pessimistic about the possibility of individual and societal perfection, the pacifists perpetuated the tradition of perfectionism that characterized antebellum reform. Through their work the perfectionist pacifists endeavored to alter the political and social fabric of the nation and the world. In the process the organization they created became extremely sectarian and doctrinaire, impeding the UPU's ability to bring about constructive change. As is true with other radical movements, the UPU's rigidity explains its failure.",304058547,,Dissertations & Theses," Curran, Thomas F.CurranF.ThomasCurran, Thomas F.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747668841 , 28108841 , 66569 , 9328891 , 9328891", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304058547?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , postwar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22The+weapons+of+our+warfare+are+not+carnal%22%3A+Civil+War+pacifism%2C+perfectionism%2C+and+roots+of+post-war+radicalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Curran%2C+Thomas+F.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3442,Pentecostal/Charismatic spirituality: Looking through the lens of ritual,"This dissertation examines Pentecostal ritual as an expression of and an efficacious dynamic within Pentecostal/Charismatic spirituality. It aims to describe and interpret Pentecostal/Charismatic spirituality by means of a ritual study. Through ethnographic fieldwork including the methods of participant observation and ethnographic interviewing, the study focuses on data collected from the central Pentecostal ritual, the Sunday worship service, in three Northern California congregations over a period of more than two years. The dissertation seeks to understand Pentecostal/Charismatic spirituality by utilizing both indigenous categories and those suggested by ritologists and social scientists, especially Ronald L. Grimes and Victor Turner. In order to better interpret the Pentecostal rites and their attending spirituality the first two chapters provide an introduction and orientation to the study as a whole. Chapter one presents a historical outline of the 20th century Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement and, in particular, an overview of the Assemblies of God, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, and Vineyard Christian Fellowship. These three denominations function as the parent organizations to the three local congregations studied. Chapter two sketches portraits of the three congregations as expressions of local Pentecostal/Charismatic religion. In chapters three, four, and five the dissertation turns to consider distinctive elements and dynamics of the central Pentecostal. Chapter three discusses six select elements of the Pentecostal/Charismatic ritual field, i.e., ritual time, space, identity/roles, sights, sounds, and kinesthetic dimensions. Chapter four identifies a foundational three part structural/processual dimension of the ritual and explores its component rites. Chapter five presents seven modes of ritual sensibility discovered during our field research. The dissertation maintains that the Pentecostal ritual practices are oriented and animated by these embodied attitudes. In chapter six the dissertation gives attention to some of the communicative and efficacious roles that Pentecostal/Charismatic ritual performance plays within the community and its spirituality. The final chapter, seven, sets forth qualities and characteristics of Pentecostal spirituality within six selected indigenous symbols and then summarizes the chief characteristic qualities under the rubric of experience of God.",304059988,,Dissertations & Theses," Albrecht, Daniel E.AlbrechtE.DanielAlbrecht, Daniel E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747004371 , 27873361 , 66569 , 9322121 , 9322121", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304059988?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Charismatic , Pentecostal , worship",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pentecostal%2FCharismatic+spirituality%3A+Looking+through+the+lens+of+ritual&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Albrecht%2C+Daniel+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3443,"The political economy of Thailand: The Thai peripheral state, 1958-1988","This dissertation attempts to make a fresh contribution to theories of the state by developing the potential of Marx's and neo-Marxist concepts in order to produce new concepts of the state. Its key objective is to use these concepts as a tool to analyze the development of Thai political economy with a focus on examining the restructuring of the Thai state. Another key objective is to eliminate some illusions about the independent and democratic form of the state. It demonstrates that from 1958 to 1988 the Thai state was essentially peripheral in relations to the U.S. imperial state and the Japanese economic empire. The construction of this peripheral state was responsible for a special kind of capitalist development in Thailand: a strategy of over-exploitation composed of many primitive forms--primitive accumulation, semi-slave production, child labor production, prostitution and absolute surplus value. To operate this over-exploitation, the repressive class-state force was formed justifying itself as necessary for ""development"" and for the defeat of communism. Its main purpose was to silence all political and economic movements of workers and farmers, suppressing their political and economic rights. The growth of Thai economy was based on impoverishment of farmers and intensive exploitation of labor: farmers were indebted, income plummet as prices declined forcing many into low paid industrial and ""service"" employment. High profits were based on the intensified exploitations of farmers, prostitutes, and child laborers. The social costs, however, far exceed the worst period of the 19th century revolution in the West. Thailand which was a former center of Buddhism has become the global center of sex-exploitation. Thailand with a rich cultural past has become a country of cultural anomie and moral decay. Today thousands of whore houses, bars, and other ""entertainment"" centers sell not only sex but everyday death. Estimates are that by the year 2000 between 4 and 6 million Thais will have infected with the HIV virus.",304070567,,Dissertations & Theses," Wongchaisuwan, TienchaiWongchaisuwanTienchaiWongchaisuwan, Tienchai", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747242541 , 28114631 , 66569 , 9326093 , 9326093", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304070567?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science"," 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science"," 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science",," 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science"," History , Social structure , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+economy+of+Thailand%3A+The+Thai+peripheral+state%2C+1958-1988&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wongchaisuwan%2C+Tienchai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3444,Cherishing as a model of education: A spiritual journey,"This critique examines the dominant consciousness of contemporary schooling and society while discussing how competition, standardized testing, and the effective schools movement continue to diminish and depersonalize students. This study addresses the issues of students' and teachers' suffering and alienation and focuses on the need for healing, connection, and wholeness in our lives and in our society. A model of schooling, based on the concept of cherishing and grounded in a spirituality of love, justice, mercy and compassion, is proposed based on the personal journey of the researcher and linked to one's basic assumptions about humanity and the universe. Religious and spiritual language are used to gain a new perspective and awareness of education. Reflection, by teachers, on one's basic beliefs and practices in schooling is urged. Selective literature, on caring, interpersonal relationships, global interdependence, the need for social and political reform, and the need for an alternative consciousness, is examined as a foundation for a paradigm of cherishing in schools and society. The writings of Nel Noddings, Alfie Kohn, Martin Buber, Paulo Freire, Rita Brock, David Purpel, and Walter Brueggemann are examined extensively. The researcher envisions a society based on love, justice, and compassion where each individual is valued, cherished, and respected, regardless of ability or achievement.

Conceptually and aesthetically, Butoh is based on the traditional Japanese body, which for hundreds of years has been shaped by lifestyle and livelihood. There are several characteristics that shape Butoh, but the use of the body is the one that most clearly sets Butoh apart from other dance genres. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how the body as used in Butoh is a reflection of the body as it is manifested in everyday Japanese life and how the Butoh aesthetic is related to the traditional Japanese aesthetic. To set the context from which Butoh arose, the introduction recalls the artistic, social, and political climate of the times, and establishes the life and work of Hijikata Tatsumi, Butoh's principal founder. The seeds of Butoh were planted in the Post World War II period of the 1950s when Hijikata and co-founder Ohno Kazuo began to question the nature of dance itself and what it meant to them. Butoh was born in the process of reexamining their own culture and tradition, and out of a need to create an indigenous modern genre of dance. The introduction is followed by a portrait of the researcher, a Certified Movement Analyst and dance artist who lived, studied, and performed Butoh in Japan from 1987 to 1989. The main body of research is revealed in the three ""body"" chapters: the body concrete--the human form and proportion; the body ethereal--the concepts of ""spirit"" and ""self,"" the use of imagery and energy; and the body adorned--the coatings and coverings. These bodies constitute a holistic concept of the body as a subject of study and they merge in ""The Butoh Body Aesthetic"" in which pervasive characteristics of Butoh are identified, the life and work of Hijikata being the thread woven throughout. The final chapter addresses how changes within the Japanese culture and physical body as well as the growing number of Butoh inspired works created by non-Japanese artists may affect the aesthetics of Butoh and the dance genre's vitality and continued impact on the international dance community.

Hamburg was a hub both of international commerce and of cultural interchange with north German and European princely courts. Its Goosemarket opera, which operated for sixty years under protection of the Rat, with the support of aristocratic patrons, and to paying, popular audiences, became the principal locus for the formation of Hamburg's hybrid bourgeois/aristocratic secular high culture on the eve of the Enlightenment. The individuals who initiated the Enlightenment movement in Hamburg in the 1720s and 1730s belonged to the generation that grew up in the shadow of the Goosemarket opera. This study begins by reconstructing the salient features of Hamburg's high culture in the galant period--the period in which the opera was founded. In the musical and literary treatises published in Hamburg in the decade of the 1700s, the galant appears as a positive ideal of worldly wisdom, practical knowledge, good taste and inner cultivation. This ideal was transformed in the writings of Christian Friedrich Hunold, Johann Mattheson, Barthold Heinrich Brockes, and other early Aufklarer as they passed from youth to adulthood. In the Hamburg Patriot (1724-26), the most important moral weekly of the Fruhaufklarung, the ""galant homme"" is a negative ideal, the heuristic anti-type to the ""good burgher,"" reflecting the critical distance of the Hamburg Aufklarer from their own galant youth. Yet galant social values were carried forward in the early Enlightenment in the ethos of intellectual cultivation and refinement and the galant aesthetic of simplicity and naturalness was carried forward in the moral cantatas of Reinhard Keiser, harbingers of the proto-classical vocal style of another Hamburg composer, Georg Philipp Telemann. The cantatas of Keiser and Telemann--brief, technically simple music, suitable for amateur performance, and embodying the ethical and didactic impulses of the German Enlightenment--set the standard for eighteenth-century vocal chamber music, replacing the operatic standard--complex, technically difficult music for the stage.",304073176,,Dissertations & Theses," Le Bar, Ann CatherineLe BarCatherineAnnLe Bar, Ann Catherine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745499931 , 26962791 , 66569 , 9409330 , 9409330", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304073176?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0413 Music , 0311 Germanic literature"," 0335 European history , 0413 Music , 0311 Germanic literature"," 0335 European history , 0413 Music , 0311 Germanic literature",," 0335 European history , 0413 Music , 0311 Germanic literature"," European history , Music , Germanic literature"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Germany , opera",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Musical+culture+and+the+origins+of+the+Enlightenment+in+Hamburg&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Le+Bar%2C+Ann+Catherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3447,"The enduring or disappearing South? Testing regional convergence of church attendance, racial prejudice, and gun ownership","Sociologists have long been interested in contemporary social change, and have defined this change by concepts such as massification, secularization, societalization, and urbanization. It is generally assumed that these processes have diminished regional and residential differences. In this study I investigated whether differences in church attendance, racial prejudice, and gun ownership--between the southern and nonsouthern U.S.--had declined over the past 20 years. If regional differences had declined, I was interested in identifying factors which might be related to this decline. I tested the effects of the following upon regional convergence: (1) cohort replacement and the regional convergence of birth cohorts, (2) migration from the Nonsouth to the South, (3) residential mobility, (4) education, and (5) movement from the country to the city. The analysis showed significant regional convergences of church attendance, racial prejudice, and gun ownership over the past two decades. The convergence of birth cohorts had its greatest effect upon the regional convergence of racial prejudice, a lesser effect upon that of gun ownership, and no effect upon the convergence of church attendance. Of the other four explanatory factors, migration to the South generally had the most important effect. Education had an effect upon the convergence of birth cohorts with regard to racial prejudice. This suggests that increasing levels of education among more recent birth cohorts has contributed to a lowering of racial prejudice in the South. The effects of residential mobility and movement to the city were relatively unimportant. What do these trends mean for the future regional distinctiveness of the South? Most likely, further population shifts from the Nonsouth to the South and increasing levels of education in the South will result in a continuing decline of attitudes and values generally associated with the culture of the southern U.S. The South as myth will probably continue to be fostered, however, in contemporary music, literature, and film. There is a need for future analyses of regional differences in other parts of the world, particularly given the increasing importance of regional ethnic and cultural factors in current international conflicts.",304074438,,Dissertations & Theses," Kanagy, Conrad LeeKanagyLeeConradKanagy, Conrad Lee", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 744473611 , 27034741 , 66569 , 9334757 , 9334757", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304074438?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0366 Geography"," 0700 Social structure , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0366 Geography"," 0700 Social structure , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0366 Geography",," 0700 Social structure , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0366 Geography"," Social structure , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Urban planning , Area planning & development , Geography", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+enduring+or+disappearing+South%3F+Testing+regional+convergence+of+church+attendance%2C+racial+prejudice%2C+and+gun+ownership&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kanagy%2C+Conrad+Lee&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3448,"Population control and the perseverance of eugenics: A case study of the politics of fertility control, Alvin Ratz Kaufman, 1930-1979","Alvin Ratz Kaufman was an Ontario-based industrialist, philanthropist, and eugenicist, active in the field of birth control from the early 1930s until the late 1970s. For almost fifty years, and concurrent with his domestic efforts, Kaufman promoted the delivery of birth control overseas in Korea, India, Malaysia, Bangladesh and St. Vincent in the Caribbean; as he had within Canada, Kaufman favoured first the lay-delivery of ""simple"" contraceptives and after the war, sterilization, in order to limit the fertility of the social underclass. Kaufman's Canadian fertility control efforts in the 1930s have been relatively well documented; in particular, the 1936-7 trial of one of his home visitation workers for illegally advertising contraceptives has been extensively investigated. But his international and post-World War II efforts have been almost entirely ignored. Consequently, both Kaufman and the larger domestic birth control movement of which he was a member have been misinterpreted as primarily of intra-national importance. Furthermore, the failure to examine the continuation of Kaufman's birth control efforts after the Second World War has resulted in a narrow understanding of his methods.

Fifteen recurring themes were identified through an extensive review of literature. Themes and clarifying descriptions were presented to technological literacy experts from diverse fields. Respondents were affiliated with either the New Liberal Arts (NLA) group or the Science, Technology &amp; Society (STS) movement. The respondents' opinions were obtained from two telephone interviews. In Phase I, the recommendations of the respondents were combined to produce an updated list of 18 themes. The updated list included four additional themes, one consolidation of two themes, revisions for all of the descriptions, but no deletions. In Phase II, the respondents rated the themes on a 10-point scale. A one-way analysis of variance and a Scheffe comparison were used to test for significant differences among the mean ratings of themes. Only the top-ranked and the lowest-ranked themes were significantly different at the.05 level. Comments from the respondents added a dimension that was not conveyed by the quantitative ratings. The ratings and comments of respondents suggested that a variety of themes are important in the development of technological literacy in postsecondary core courses. Seventeen themes are offered to educators as a framework to guide the development of technological literacy. The prioritized list includes the following themes: change/diffusion; quantitative analysis; economic; political; environmental/ecological; technological; risk assessment; ethical/moral; social/cultural; historical; scientific; humanistic; international and global; military; behavioral; contemporary and futuristic; and human rights and freedom. Clarifying descriptions of each theme are included in the report. The prioritized list is not a recommendation that themes be taught in order; however attention should be devoted to the range of themes and to their prioritization. Although the themes are prioritized in the report, increments between adjacent ratings are far too small to approach statistical significance. It is recommended that a thematic approach be used to develop technological literacy in postsecondary core courses.

According to tradition Christianity came to South India in A.D. 52 through the apostle Thomas. By the fourth century the Syrian Orthodox Church was established in South India by the Syrian merchants who arrived in the State of Kerala for trade purposes. The Roman Catholics came with the arrival of the Portuguese by the end of the fifteenth century. Till this time there was no special attention given to the evangelization of the country. After the Protestant Reformation the Lutheran missionaries established their mission station in South India. Subsequent to their arrival many more mission organizations arrived. With the British as the rulers and Westerners as missionaries the ministry had very little effect upon the people of India. Evangelization was very slow. Those missionaries generally used the traditional methods of communication of the gospel through schools, hospitals, orphanages and preaching. With a culture that is caste oriented and diverse it was very difficult to effectively communicate the gospel. Today Christianity remains a minority with only about 4% of the population. After the emergence of the Pentecostal Churches from the beginning of this century the mission work became more active and many non-Christians accepted the Christian faith. Within the past several decades the Small Group ministry became very popular all around the world and it became a very effective means of Church growth in many countries. A brief survey of the various International Small Group movements is done to see its effectiveness in those countries. Under the present political and social setting of India the house Church movement and Small Group ministry will be very effective for the renewal and growth of the Pentecostal Churches. Through the Small Group ministry the lay people can be mobilized and many people can participate in the ministry and do very effective evangelism without much advertisement and by making use of spiritual gifts, Bible study and personal evangelism as the methods to reach the masses.

Now largely forgotten, Frank, who belonged to the same generation as Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, played a seminal role in the history of modern architecture. After graduating from the Vienna Technische Hochschule in 1910, he established a practice with Oskar Strnad and Oskar Wlach, producing a series of houses in a pared-down, geometrical look that later became characteristic of the International Style. After World War I Frank emerged as one of the leading modernists in Austria. He was invited to participate in the epochal 1927 Weissenhof housing exhibition, and in 1928 he took part in the first meeting of the CIAM (Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne). By the mid-1920s, however, Frank had begun to have growing doubts about the direction of modern architecture. Disturbed by what he viewed as the ""machine pathos"" and ""romanticized"" rationalism of the architectural left, he published essays and a book calling for a new, undogmatic approach to modernism, one which would be concerned less with issues of style and form and more with real human needs, both physical and psychological. In 1934 he left Austria and settled in Sweden, where he concentrated his attentions on interior design. His softened, comfortable, humanly-scaled furnishings were widely imitated by Scandinavian designers and helped inspire the Swedish Modern style. Late in life, Frank charted a new direction, this time calling for an architecture based on happenstance, an idea which he termed ""Accidentism."" Drawing on a wide variety of sources, this study seeks to reconstruct the intellectual, cultural, political, and social context in which Frank moved. It calls into question the notion of a unified modernist movement, arguing instead that modern architecture was continuously being redefined by its adherents and that this debate constituted an ongoing crisis. Frank's career and his critique of the radical modernists are viewed against these architectural debates and the forces that gave rise to postmodernism in the 1960s.",304088729,,Dissertations & Theses," Long, Christopher AlanLongAlanChristopherLong, Christopher Alan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747228861 , 28136771 , 66569 , 9323481 , 9323481", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304088729?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies"," 0729 Architecture , 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies"," 0729 Architecture , 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies",," 0729 Architecture , 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies"," Architecture , History , European history , Biographies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Austria , Frank, Josef",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Josef+Frank+and+the+crisis+of+modern+architecture&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Long%2C+Christopher+Alan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3452,Sendero Luminoso and the Indian problem in contemporary Peru: Conquering the other,"In the years following World War II, Peru experienced rapid economic and cultural changes, but within the confines of capitalism's uneven and contradictory development. Attempts to resolve these economic and ethnic discrepancies at regional and national levels--the re-opening of an important Andean university, the 1968 ""Revolution"" carried out by the armed forces--combined with the international political fissures produced by the Sino-Soviet split and the student movement of the late 1960s, to create a conjuncture favourable to the emergence of Sendero Luminoso in 1980. The complex, often ambiguous, ethnic landscape of the Andes, in which Sendero operates with mixed success, although long since penetrated by the destructive forces of capitalism, has proven impervious to Western social scientists and the Peruvian intellectual elite. In response to Sendero and the violence of the war both have resurrected, implicitly or explicitly, the old debate on the ""Indian problem."" Sendero represents both a case study in the conditions that can lead to revolutionary violence, and an example of the inadequacy of conventional academic wisdom to interpret and situate that violence.",304096412,,Dissertations & Theses," Derkson, Wade W.DerksonW.WadeDerkson, Wade W.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 748061941 , 28317601 , 66569 , 9780315860209 , 0315860200 , MM86020 , MM86020", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993," 9780315860209 , 0315860200", English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304096412?accountid=14496, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history,, 0336 Latin American history, Latin American history, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sendero+Luminoso+and+the+Indian+problem+in+contemporary+Peru%3A+Conquering+the+other&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Derkson%2C+Wade+W.&amp;isbn=9780315860209&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3453,"The CNT during the Second Republic in Barcelona: Leaders, activists, and members","The CNT during the Second Republic in Barcelona; leaders, activists and members. This research had as its aim to analyze more throughly the functioning of one of the most influential trades-unions of the 1930's, the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour), anarcho-syndicalist in tendency. Knowledge of its internal dynamics has allowed both a more detailed perception of the influence of the CNT amongst the workers, and to measure the variety, composition and strength of its activists and the nature of the relations it established with the majority of the working class. The militants of the Confederation appear in the light of this analysis as a large sector, although in a minority with respect to the total number of workers affiliated to the Confederation, that was very active and specialized in specific union tasks that depended on the place in which they developed their activities. The decisive sector consisted of the militants that participated in the organization's general and global discussions, in which not all members participated. It was a wide sector based around the single unions and which normally attended the general assemblies of militants that these unions called. Thus, the Confederation did not show a hierarchical structure like a pyramid, but a structure based on the existence of a diffuse responsibility in which a large collective participated. The militants of the base, however, did not participate in these general debates, and only dealt with tasks and demands of a professional nature. In this context the support of the majority of members affiliated to the Confederation can be explained, not exactly by their active participation in the life of the organization, but by specific nature of the libertarian movement of the time, which went far beyond mere union matters. Street life, the neighbourhoods, culture, leisure and the varied aspects of the social life of the working class were impregnated by libertarian ideals, and shaped the working-class culture of the time, and were the undeniable reference point the working class identified with.",304113561,,Dissertations & Theses," Monjo Omedes, AnnaMonjo OmedesAnnaMonjo Omedes, Anna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739100541 , 27579071 , 66569 , C540014 , C540014", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993,, Catalan, Catalan,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304113561?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0629 Labor relations"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0629 Labor relations"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0629 Labor relations",," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0629 Labor relations"," European history , History , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Confederaci\'on Nacional del Trabajo , Spain",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+CNT+during+the+Second+Republic+in+Barcelona%3A+Leaders%2C+activists%2C+and+members&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Monjo+Omedes%2C+Anna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3454,"""Dancing At Lughnasa"": The carnivalesque in Brian Friel's plays","This thesis is an analysis of Brian Friel's play Dancing At Lughnasa, with specific reference to the carnivalesque element as it manifests itself in the play's dramaturgical and thematic composition. The introductory chapter traces the history of the practices of Carnival as they emanated from the seasonal fertility rites of various ancient cultures--all of which were assimilated by Christianity at a later date. It further identifies Mikhail Bakhtin as the twentieth century critic who designated the term ""carnivalized literature"" which draws on the actual occasions of revelry for its composition, but is also recognized as an entity within itself. Bakhtin's Carnival vocabulary (""crowning/uncrowning"", ""second life"", ""transformation downward"") is applied firstly to the Irish Literary Renaissance (1898-1926) as the mainspring from which the tradition of Dancing is derived. The terms are subsequently applied to four selected plays of Friel between 1963 and 1987 and the context of Carnival is investigated in each play with respect to a dramaturgy that, as it becomes increasingly more diversified and complex, evolves from the verbal to the preverbal and visual. Dancing At Lughnasa's presentational/representational structure is perceived as one which alternately engages and alienates the audience. The play is viewed as a dramaturgical culmination and a thematic departure with respect to Friel's prior works. A highly evolved, festive, multifaceted dramaturgy (form) explores the nature of ritual and celebration (content). The character of the priest in this play is seen as Friel's resolution to the tension between the official and the unofficial--a continual preoccupation in his former works. Conversely the social, economic and political status of women emerges as an entirely new topic--one which is shown to be intrinsic to the notion of Carnival. The thesis concludes that the play is carnivalesque as to both form and structure but that revolution in the lives of the particular characters (the story) does not emerge from this marriage. Dance/music as a metaphor for the underlying dynamics between/among the Irish characters addresses the other themes of failure, unfulfillment, powerlessness, but in so doing it equally addresses the possibility of community and empowerment. The ""international"" or ""universal"" appeal of this particular play is thus ascribed to the vocabulary of the dance (movement) as one which precedes the parameters of any specific culture, Irish, African or whatever. The thesis finally concludes that this ambiguity of interpretation is integral to the notion of Carnival, which by definition concerns itself with the process of replacing, the refusal to concur with any fixed authority, the eternal question, rather than suggesting any definitive answer.",89221596,,Dissertations & Theses," O'Flaherty, Margo ReganO'FlahertyReganMargoO'Flaherty, Margo Regan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 743034681 , 27595661 , 66569 , 9780315883727 , 0315883723 , MM88372 , MM88372", Dissertation/Thesis, 1993," 9780315883727 , 0315883723", English, English,,1993,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/89221596?accountid=14496," 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Theater , British and Irish literature"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Northern Ireland",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Dancing+At+Lughnasa%22%3A+The+carnivalesque+in+Brian+Friel%27s+plays&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Flaherty%2C+Margo+Regan&amp;isbn=9780315883727&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3455,The establishment of ASI chapters in Tanzania,"Statement of project . The purposes of this project were first, to study the multifaceted aspects and the importance of ASI (Association of Privately Owned Seventh-day Adventist Services and Industries) in the United States of America, and second, to develop an approach for the establishment of ASI chapters in the Tanzania Union Mission of Seventh-day Adventists. Method . To accomplish the above purposes, primary sources of information were consulted, such as a survey of ASI and other relevant literature including ASI audio and video tapes in order to discover the historical background and cultural setting of ASI. The development of the self-supporting movement of the Seventh-day Adventist church from 1904–1947 and the recent trends from 1947 to the present have been described using the primary sources and supplemented through interviews and discussions with ASI leaders. Furthermore, the contributions of ASI to the Seventh-day Adventist church in the areas of home and mission projects and denominational structure (the means of revival) have been investigated. The second part of this study outlines the national and church conditions that justify the establishment of ASI chapters in Tanzania. Study has been given to the ways ASI chapters in Tanzania could help the Global Mission of the Seventh-day Adventist church. Such areas include health projects, improvement of the Tanzania Seminary and College, creation of scholarship funds by businessmen, improving small farms, nutrition seminars, training of lay people in witnessing techniques, and developing appropriate social centers. Summary, conclusions, and recommendations complete the whole study. Expectations from the project . The foremost expectation of this project was, is, and will be (1) the development of ASI chapters in Tanzania, (2) the involvement of more members in Global Mission projects and activities, giving Adventist lay people a sense of identity outside of their usual business associations and clubs, (3) increasing the public's awareness of the Seventhday Adventist church, and (4) the development of another resource for the furthering of God's work in Tanzania. And last, but not least, this project has helped me to develop and refine my skills, making me a resource person to help with the development of ASI chapters in the Tanzania Union Mission.",287966187,,Dissertations & Theses," Magesa, Israel MangoreMagesaMangoreIsraelMagesa, Israel Mangore", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764728351 , 30131991 , 66569 , 3096513 , 3096513", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/287966187?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations",," 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations"," Religion , Religious congregations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Association of Privately Owned Seventh-day Adventist Services and Industries , Mission , Seventh-day Adventist , Tanzania",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+establishment+of+ASI+chapters+in+Tanzania&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Magesa%2C+Israel+Mangore&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3456,Local conflict and ideological struggle: #positive images'and section 28,"The work focuses on a chain of events that began in the London Borough of Haringey in 1986. The Labour-led local council's adoption of a policy that would promote 'positive images' of homosexuality in local schools erupted into a conflict that led, in part, to Parliament's passage of Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act, which prohibits the 'promotion of homosexuality.' The dissertation examines the local conflict, investigating circumstances and actions that led to the creation of the policy, underlying economic, social and political tensions in the borough that were exacerbated by the conflict, and the consequent strategic opposition and support of both formally and informally constituted local political groups. It describes the movement of the conflict from the local to the national stage, analysing the national context in which coalitions opposed, supported, and attempted to ignore the policy in national political circles. It studies the construction of homosexuality as a campaign issue in the 1987 general election, the creation of the 1988 law, and the effects that the law had on the Borough. The work investigates the conflict's oppOSitional and exclusionary discourses on homosexuality embodied by the statements of those who were engaged in opposing the Haringey policy and supporting the Government's law. Five interrelated discourses of order were overwhelmingly present in the debates, are included in the brief text of the Section, and are contemporary interpretations of dominant historical discourses on homosexuality: 1. The promotion of 'positive images' of homosexuality is a form of political propaganda or indoctrination that poses a threat to the nation. 2. Homosexuality can be 'promoted' by homosexual predators who force, recruit and/ or proselytise their way of life on unsuspecting innocents. 3. Homosexuality is a disease that, combined with the more recent spectre of AIDS, creates a powerful threat of homosexuality -- or 'positive images' -- as spreading epidemic. 4. Homosexuality is a 'pretended family relationship' that reinforces a notion of 'real' family that consequently excludes other family forms. 5. 'Positive images' of homosexuality would adversely affect innocent children and troubled adolescents. Taken as a whole, the local and national conflict constituted an ideological struggle in which the meaning and import of homosexuality was severely contested and simultaneously transformed. It identifies and connects both action and discourse as major sites of ideological struggle. It posits the possibility of not 'studying down' nor 'studying up,' but of studying through, and thus offers an anthropological model that enables an integrated investigation of both local and global levels.",301472878,,Dissertations & Theses," Reinhold, SusanReinholdSusanReinhold, Susan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757173461 , 44530361 , 101309 , U060524 , U060524", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301472878?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU060524 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Local+conflict+and+ideological+struggle%3A+%23positive+images%27and+section+28&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reinhold%2C+Susan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3457,The Sephardi community of Shanghai and the question of identity 1844 - 1937.,"From 1845 Baghdadi Jews settled in Shanghai via India, and over 100 years of existence, their numbers never exceeded 1,000. They were exposed to great changes in their social, economic and political environment. Traditionalists felt that loyalties to the customs of their Baghdadi forebears and occasionally even to Judaism itself were being threatened. The action they took to preserve their Jewish and ethnic identity is observed, and changes in ethnic identity in Shanghai between 1845 - 1937 are analysed. Attention is paid to their choice of the title `Sephardi'; the religious and communal institutions they established in order to preserve their identity; their contribution to the economic development of the International Settlement with particular reference to their investment in real estate; the reasons for their tenacious endeavours to be accepted as British subjects, while remaining loyal to their religion; and their restraint in identifying with the Zionist movement. Conventional methods of historical research have been used. Among a wide range of primary and secondary materials, particular reliance has been placed on the Israel's Messenger , the only newsheet from the community (published from 22 April 1904 to 17 October, 1941 with some interruptions). A number of interviews have also been carried out with erstwhile members of the community. It will be shown that the hopes and ambitions of the founding fathers, as expressed by David Solomon Sassoon that traders who left Baghdad to settle in new countries would remain true to the tenets of the Jewish religion and to the traditional observance of Baghdad, were partially fulfilled. This is an example of the flexibility achieved by so many Jewish communities in the Diaspora, while still remaining faithful to their essential beliefs and values, and which has contributed to their survival. It is hoped this addition to the considerable body of literature which documents the history of Jewish communities in the East will promote an understanding of their economic development and social transformation.",301495985,,Dissertations & Theses," Meyer, M.J.MeyerM.J.Meyer, M.J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757232981 , 44547501 , 101309 , U062446 , U062446", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301495985?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIU062446 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Sephardi+community+of+Shanghai+and+the+question+of+identity+1844+-+1937.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meyer%2C+M.J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3458,Changing soundscapes: music and identity in Finland.,"This thesis presents an ethnography of contemporary folk music in an urban and in a rural context in Finland. The focus is on processes of transmission through the implementation of education programmes, performance contexts, the interrelations and divisions between musical genres, and musicians' perceptions of musical continuity and change. One of the principal questions addressed concerns how people express identity through music. The ways in which folk music has drawn on, and incorporated, traditions from diverse sources, including other European folk traditions and 'world' music, are described in conjunction with showing how Finnish identity is continually reconstructed in relation to neighbouring countries, and more generally in the global context. It is argued that music not only reflects, but also shapes, patterns of social identity. In the first part of the thesis (chapters 1-3) the historical, cultural and social contexts in which contemporary folk music may be interpreted are examined. An outline of the historical background is provided, followed by a discussion of folk music research and concepts of folk music within the context of nineteenth century nationalism. An account of the folk revival movement of the 1960s, focusing on trends of folk music research, education programmes, and musicians' performances and recordings, which contributed to the emergence of 'new folk' music in the 1980s, leads to the second part of the thesis.

Whereas the predominant analysis of the experience of popular participation during the period has emphasised structural level phenomena, here an attempt is made to combine actor-oriented and structural-historical approaches in order to identify the key factors which operated to shape the development of local participation. In such a way the thesis stresses how micro-level factors - life experiences, subjective meanings and group dynamics - interacted with macro-level processes. The thesis starts by identifying the dimensions and theories of popular participation which relate to its objectives, intensities and outcomes, in order to frame the research questions. The period studied is then contextualised with a history of Nicaragua, establishing the authoritarian conditions which marginalised the majority of Nicaraguans from economic development and political processes. Next, the thesis examines Sandinista political theory, the channels of popular participation and the macro-level factors which restricted its development. It also describes how the cooperative movement evolved during the period of Sandinista rule as an expression of the peasant movement in the context of state paternalism. The main analytical body of the thesis starts by providing background details about the two case studies. Then it details and compares the participatory processes underway within the cooperatives, focusing on the assembly, leadership and women; the different intensities of participation; and the social factors influencing it. These processes are evaluated qualitatively and it is demonstrated that despite apparent limitations, participation enhanced the social, political and psychological power of cooperative members although in different, uneven and contradictory ways. The thesis concludes that although the participation of peasants in national level structures was restricted, the objective conditions created by the FSLN contributed to the qualitative empowerment of individuals incorporated into cooperatives.

AIDS education efforts and accompanying AIDS discourses have been created mainly by elites, such as governmental and non-governmental organizations, religious groups, doctors, academics, and media producers. Simultaneously, AIDS is a major concern of international health organizations that promote specific policies in a variety of cultural settings. These national and international elites contest the meanings of scientific findings and the nature of sexuality. In addition, Brazilian elites struggle to create a broad-based social movement out of AIDS, and try to change sexual behavior through AIDS education. The politics of AIDS provides a unique case study of the politics of the relations between Brazilian elites and the impoverished masses. As AIDS increasingly spreads to impoverished women, the cultural gap between the classes is increasingly apparent. AIDS programs, failing to understand the sexual culture of the lower classes and the specific problems of impoverished women, fare poorly in their attempts to change sexual behavior in this disenfranchised population. My dissertation is a study of the politics of impoverished women's sexuality, how it relates to the spread of AIDS, how it is misunderstood and manipulated by elites, and how it relates to other aspects of class, cultural, racial, sexual, and gender relations in Brazil. Using participant observation and hundreds of interviews with both elite AIDS program workers and the class that serves them as impoverished domestic servants, my research examines the class-based cultural gap, using the AIDS crisis as a lens through which to view the class disjuncture in the discourse of sexuality. Through the juxtaposition and cultural analysis of the interrelated worlds of elite activism and impoverished women, I document how AIDS is constructed in the Brazilian context, particularly during the years 1991 and 1992. My dissertation research tries to enlarge our understanding of the cultural construction of sexuality, race, gender, public/private, AIDS, science, and new social movements in Brazil. Brazilian AIDS discourses are embedded in a complex web of sexual, racial, cultural, class, and gender politics that not only define the parameters of the epidemic, but also question and challenge the nature of public/private, class/culture, and masculine/feminine body politics in Brazil. I draw from a number of theoretical and interpretive frameworks drawn from inter-disciplinary sources to understand how AIDS discourses affect women. Writing the ethnography of AIDS education and political strategies as a sympathetic form of cultural critique could lead to the formulation of alternative strategies by AIDS organizations. Furthermore, providing a detailed account of how poor urban women discuss AIDS in the context of their own sexuality may also lead to a rethinking of AIDS education in the Brazilian cultural context. In addition, my research intends to bridge the gap in research on Brazilian women's sexuality.

This dissertation examines the relationship between three currents (nationalism, cultural aesthetics, and musical historicism) and African-American music from the late 19th century to the present. African-American nationalism, based on the belief that African Americans in the United States share a common cultural foundation based on their African heritage and their experiences in the New World, covers a range of viewpoints, from assimilationism to separatism. Cultural aesthetics focus on the efforts of African Americans to develop philosophies of artistic expression that embody the African-American experience. Historians of African-American music, particularly through comprehensive histories, endeavor to create philosophies that depict the correlation between these three currents and music. The relationship of African-American nationalism and cultural aesthetics to music will be examined in four ""test cases"": (1) the African-American concert spiritual from the 1870s through the 1940s, (2) African-American musical theater from its origins in the 19th century through Joplin's Treemonisha (1911), (3) jazz, with particular attention to the music of Duke Ellington, and (4) rap music from the 1970s through the 1990s. Each of these genres was created by African-American artists primarily for African-American audiences and later modified (by either Euro-American or African-American musicians) in order to appeal to mainstream American audiences. The spiritual began as African-American folk music but became known to national and international audiences through concert arrangements. The ragtime music of Joplin's era had its origins in saloons and bars; nevertheless, Joplin sought to place ragtime within the tradition of European art music with the composition of his opera Treemonisha. The multi-movement compositions of Ellington owe much to both African-American and Euro-American musical traditions. Rap, which originated as African-American dance music in the late 1970s and later became a vehicle for African-American political and social expression, ""crossed over"" from African-American audiences to mainstream American audiences by the mid-1980s.",304091890,,Dissertations & Theses," Strong, Willie FrankStrongFrankWillieStrong, Willie Frank", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740973491 , 28558151 , 66569 , 9500699 , 9500699", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304091890?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0328 Black history"," 0413 Music , 0328 Black history"," 0413 Music , 0328 Black history",," 0413 Music , 0328 Black history"," Music , Black history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Philosophies+of+African+American+music+history&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Strong%2C+Willie+Frank&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3462,"Innovators and gravediggers: Capital restructuring and class formation in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1945-1994","This dissertation examines how international economic transformations converged with capital restructuring efforts and local progrowth coalitions to redesign Ann Arbor's physical and cultural landscape. It also studies the effects on working-class communities and the shifting contours of class formation. I begin with the area's largest economic institution, the University of Michigan, and the evolution of federal and corporate spending on scientific research. Consequently, U-M restructured fundraising efforts, research programs, and administrative departments to attract venture capital. Business and political leaders reacted by coordinating campaigns to attract R&amp;D companies to Ann Arbor, the self-proclaimed ""Research Center of the Midwest."" Yet, subsequent development displaced working-class neighborhoods, particularly the African-American community on the city's Northside. After WWII, these neighborhoods possessed economic institutions and cultural organizations that buttressed a powerful local civil rights movement. While gaining strength from national events, most efforts grew from traditional cultural practices and community networks that had historically empowered fights for dignity and survival in a racist community. The final chapters examine how all of these changes reflect and reinforce transformations in class structures and cultures: a new petite bourgeoisie ushers in a scientific paradigm integrating research and enterprise; peripheral development forces downtown merchants to meet the new tastes of sophisticated and globalized consumption practices; and new disciplinary narratives rationalize postindustrial production and postmodern culture. However, fragments of working-class resistance have drawn on experiences with the new socio-spatial organization of economic and social life to challenge postindustrial policies and ideologies. By drawing on emerging and residual notions of community, groups of homeless activists and public housing tenants have integrated life experiences with political action to struggle against elite progrowth visions of the postindustrial city. This study employs methodologies including archival and oral history work as well as ethnographic and participatory research to investigate the dialectical dynamics of capital accumulation, institutional restructuring and class struggle in a postindustrial city.",304097635,,Dissertations & Theses," Dolgon, CoreyDolgonCoreyDolgon, Corey", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741894811 , 29125291 , 66569 , 9513339 , 9513339", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304097635?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0323 American studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0323 American studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0323 American studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," American studies , Social structure , Urban planning , Area planning & development", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Innovators+and+gravediggers%3A+Capital+restructuring+and+class+formation+in+Ann+Arbor%2C+Michigan%2C+1945-1994&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dolgon%2C+Corey&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3463,"Recharting the Caribbean: Land, law and citizenship in the British Virgin Islands","Previous anthropological research on the Caribbean has presupposed rather than problematized the region's colonial past and nation-building present. The literature on colonial discourse and nationalism developed for other regions has no counterpart in the Caribbean literature. This dissertation's focus on colonial processes and the modern state is intended as a corrective. Based on a year of fieldwork in the British Virgin Islands, it explores how modern statecraft and law have helped differentiate British Virgin Islanders from other Caribbean peoples with whom they share a colonial past. It investigates contradictions of the current regime as British Virgin Islanders struggle to define a ""national"" culture while maintaining their colonial relationship with Britain, becoming an important tax haven, and attracting increasing numbers of immigrants from other Caribbean places. This dissertation demonstrates how kinship, nationality, race, place, and land came to be defined as ""natural"" entities that determine human life, and argues that the liberal state was central to this creation of a determining and determinate nature through its legislative and administrative procedures. The construction of a ""nature"" that is seen to constrain choices co-occurred with the introduction of democratic institutions. Why would democracy foster the construction of ""nature"" when under democratic principles people and not forces outside of human control are called upon to shape society? The answer proposed is that this construction resolves the contradiction between the liberal dictum that all persons are equal and the observation that some people seem to be more equal than others. Ideas about a natural order have come to justify a social order in which half the population is deemed ""not to belong"" and is denied citizenship. This ordering of the world has resulted in the exclusion of people from political participation, the exploitation of labor, and the movement of capital across international borders. At the same time it consolidates ""British Virgin Islanders"" as more similar to each other than to immigrants and is central to the invention of ""national"" identity in this late twentieth-century colony. The dissertation points toward similar processes occurring worldwide as ""ethnic"" and ""nativist"" attachments become increasingly important to people living in market societies, but argues that these attachments are recent constructions rather than primordial.",304104314,,Dissertations & Theses," Maurer, William M.MaurerM.WilliamMaurer, William M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741289371 , 28549651 , 66569 , 9508405 , 9508405", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304104314?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0398 Law"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0398 Law"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0398 Law",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0398 Law"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Law"," Social sciences , Virgin Islands",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Recharting+the+Caribbean%3A+Land%2C+law+and+citizenship+in+the+British+Virgin+Islands&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maurer%2C+William+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3464,The political economy of direct foreign investment: The case of Taiwan,"Direct foreign investment (DFI) has become a primary vehicle for technology transfer and capital movement from advanced countries to Third World countries. While DFI may not be a necessary condition for economic growth in developing countries, foreign capital and advanced technology certainly facilitate their economic growth one way or another. Taiwan's successful economic development over the past decades has been widely recognized. In the early stages of Taiwan's economic development, foreign investment contributed to capital accumulation and foreign exchange surplus. In the case of Taiwan, even though DFI is not as important as often thought, there is no doubt that it has been quite important in Taiwan's economy, not to mention its political implication. In searching for the factors causing the changes in the trends and features of DFI, current literature only considers demand-side effects (i.e., the host country's political stability, healthy economy, and inexpensive labor force) and economic factors while excluding supply-side effects (i.e., multinational's investment strategy, and its home government's attitude toward overseas investment) and political and social mechanisms. Accordingly, the primary objectives of this study are threefold. The first is to understand the major factors that determine the inflow of DFI in Taiwan. The basic argument that I make in this regard is that both demand and supply-side effects are equally crucial in affecting inward DFI. The second is to search for insights on the differences among foreign investors who have brought capital into Taiwan. Regional differences such as market orientation, ownership structure, the size of investment project, and sectoral difference among these investors, especially American, Japanese, and overseas Chinese, are a major concern in this regard. Finally, this study attempts to understand the momentum for changes in the nature of DFI. It argues that if change in the trends and features of inward DFI is the primary dependent variable we want to explain, the structural factors, which include both domestic and international political and socio-economic mechanisms, are the fundamental independent variables to explain this change.",304107468,,Dissertations & Theses," Yuan, Hao-LinYuanHao-LinYuan, Hao-Lin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741786301 , 28869021 , 66569 , 9519424 , 9519424", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304107468?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , China",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+economy+of+direct+foreign+investment%3A+The+case+of+Taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yuan%2C+Hao-Lin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3465,Pluralism and liberation: A critical-constructive conversation for postmodern Christian theology,"Contemporary Christian theology is marked by its concern for efficacy in promoting social justice and by its attention to the challenges of the various pluralisms that characterize the postmodern world. To date, however, these two matters have tended to be pursued in separate theological movements. Latin American Liberation theology, the most systematically developed expression of the socio-political dimensions of Christian faith, and the pluralist theology of religions, the most radical theological assessment of the place of Christianity in the religiously diverse world, are here brought together in a critical and comparative study. After a critical survey of traditional approaches to religious pluralism in Christian theology, the pluralist model is exposited and defended through an examination of four ""cases"" made by contemporary Christian philosophers and theologians for a de-absolutized, non-normative understanding of Christianity. Assessment of the critiques of pluralist theology, however, indicate that as presently articulated, this theology faces serious challenges. Central among these are its epistemological inconsistencies and its relative inability to specify the distinctiveness of Christian identity and norms for Christian practice. The conversation with liberation theology affords insights at these points of vulnerability. The praxis-based method developed by liberation theologians, in which the truths of faith are discovered and verified in the practice of working with and for the oppressed, its soteriocentric interpretation of the normativity of Jesus Christ, and its understanding of the relationality of God all offer to pluralist theology ways of affirming the normative truths of Christian commitment without imposing them on those of other perspectives, or so distorting them, in the name of interreligious harmony, that they cease to resemble that on which Christians have staked their lives. Because the Latin American movement has not itself attended to problems of pluralism and thus has not absorbed many of these insights, this conversation raises reciprocal challenges for liberation theology. Specifically, it will need to re-examine its own normative christological claims in relation to its description of the open-ended engagement of God in liberation struggles. This examination promises to enhance liberation theology's potential for global networking and prompt a deepening of its understanding of the commitment to the priority of orthopraxis over orthodoxy. The confluence of the experientially grounded and politically committed method of liberation theology and the dialogical, anti-absolutist approach of pluralist thought results in a theology that is greater than the sum of its parts. A finial component of this study is an effort to suggest the dimensions of such a theology by presenting a sketch of the liberationist-pluralist theology currently developing among Christian theologians in Asia, where the experiences of religious pluralism and the experiences of poverty and oppression intersect.",304109986,,Dissertations & Theses," McCarthy, Katherine GunningMcCarthyGunningKatherineMcCarthy, Katherine Gunning", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747032391 , 28548911 , 66569 , 9426250 , 9426250", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304109986?accountid=14496," 0469 Theology , 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy"," 0469 Theology , 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy"," 0469 Theology , 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy",," 0469 Theology , 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy"," Theology , Religious history , Religion , Philosophy"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Latin America",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pluralism+and+liberation%3A+A+critical-constructive+conversation+for+postmodern+Christian+theology&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCarthy%2C+Katherine+Gunning&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3466,Sudanese-New World migration: The social history of Sudanese international migration to the United States and Canada,"This study concentrates on the social history of Sudanese international migration to the United States and Canada. Previous studies undertaken on Sudanese migratory phenomena were primarily concerned with migration to oil-rich Arab countries (i.e. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates), this study is the first attempt to investigate Sudanese New World migration, and in specific the new waves of Sudanese migration to the US and Canada since the Gulf war of 1991 and the renewal of the civil war in the Sudan in 1989. The basic hypothesis of this research is that an earlier, small temporary migration from the Sudan to the New World, based principally (but not exclusively) on seeking higher education has been replaced by a newer, larger migration stemming from political unrest, economic stringency and a new lack of choice in migration. This latter group, of recent Sudanese arrivals, it is hypothesized, are characterized by diverse socioeconomic histories, more selective demographic differentials, fewer fundamental alternatives, and subsequent different adjustments to New World life, than earlier migrants. The study seeks to provide empirical evidence on Sudanese migration to North America by investigating three major questions: (1) Who are the migrants and from where do they come? (2) What are the reasons prompting their migration to the US and Canada? (3) How are they adapting to living in North America? The research utilized the classical anthropological methods of structured questionnaires, collection of life histories, in-depth interviews of key informants, and the examination of published and unpublished documentary sources. The most significant picture emerging from this research is that, apart from the early Sudanese migratory movement since World War II, and that of Sudanese students from the 1960s the bulk of Sudanese international migrants are very recent arrivals in the New World. Their migration was an outcome of the totality of contextual and structural variables associated with politics, war and religion prompting Sudanese with diverse ethnicity, religious affiliations and migration biographies to leave for the New World. Consequently, Sudanese migrants presently are a less monolithic group than earlier migrants. It is noticeable that not only significant differentiation's exist with respect to their selective characteristics, but also with respect to their status in the New World (i.e. students, refugees, asylees, citizens, permanent residents and diplomats). Previously, most migrants were students (and some are an unique early migrant community in Brooklyn). It follows that today both legal and illegal migrants have dramatically altered the past pattern, character, culture and shape of Sudanese international migration.

The models are used to explore the implications of the inter-generational assets transfer via altruistic bequests outstanding issues of the long-run capital movements theory, such as the determination of capital flows and the effects of capital market integration on individual/national savings, domestic income/wealth distribution, and individual welfare. The first model contrasts/compares the aggregate savings and overall macro characteristics of no-bequests, life-cycle economy (a la Cass-Yarri) as against a perfectly altruistic, bequest economy (a la Barro-Becker). Given identical technology and time preference rate, the bequest economy will run a current account surplus in the steady-state equilibrium of the integrated world economy with capital mobility. Comparing capital formation under autarky and openness for each economy, capital mobility increases the long-run national wealth of the bequest economy. By contrast, the life-cycle economy may have the greater or smaller steady-state national assets under openness. For both economies, the ranking of stationary individual welfare levels under autarky and openness depends critically upon the efficiency of their respective autarkic steady-state. However, the prospective wealthy groups in the bequest economy, expected to inherit substantially large bequests, would always be better off under openness. In the Gini-coefficient and the coefficient of variation, the capital market integration worsens the stationary intra-family distribution of total wealth (the sum of human and financial wealth) for the bequest economy. Based on social welfare functions (or Lorenze) criterion, however, the ranking of distributions is ambiguous. The second model addresses the same issues as in the first model, but under an extended version of the model which builds on a generalized form of inter-generational taste allowing of imperfect altruism. The first model's extrapolation of the Fisherian economy and bequest economy is lessened, and the two economies therein are now explained as two special cases associated respectively with insufficiently weak altruism or perfect altruism. The open-economy analysis finds that an array of conflicting theoretical results/predictions of the capital movement literature so far can be reconciled into coherent interpretations, all in view of the degrees of intergenerational altruism and the prevalence of the intergenerational assets transfer via bequests.",304116264,,Dissertations & Theses," Woo, CheonsikWooCheonsikWoo, Cheonsik", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747267491 , 29871461 , 66569 , 9427166 , 9427166", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304116264?accountid=14496, 0511 Economic theory, 0511 Economic theory, 0511 Economic theory,, 0511 Economic theory, Economic theory, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Altruistic+bequests+and+international+capital+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Woo%2C+Cheonsik&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3468,"""An innocent way out"": The literature and politics of cultural pluralism, 1880-1925","In contemporary debates on multiculturalism, 'pluralism' signifies a number of contradictory and mutually exclusive ideological positions. This dissertation situates these debates by locating the cultural and intellectual antecedents of multiculturalism beyond the social movements of the 1960s, and toward the turn of the century. The first part of the dissertation explores the intellectual genealogy of pluralism within the pragmatic tradition of William James. In 1898, James summarizes the crux of his concept in a syllabus for Philosophy I at Harvard: ""The rule is that one victorious should so far as possible keep the vanquished somehow represented. Find some innocent way out."" His brand of 'genteel pluralism' illustrates a form of crisis management, which tries to expand the boundaries of cultural inclusion at a time when the nation was undergoing dramatic demographic and economic changes. After the First World War, two of James' students, Horace Kallen and W. E. B. Du Bois, develop a pluralist politics but along different ideological lines. Kallen appropriates Jamesian pluralism for liberal progressivism, while Du Bois inscribes it within a tradition of international socialism. The second half of the dissertation examines the aesthetic manifestations of pluralism in two popular genres of the turn of the century magazine boom: local color sketches and intra-urban walking tours. Both genres chronicle ""how the other half lives,"" either from the perspective of the Howellsian flaneur searching for picturesque ruins in the Lower East Side tenements, or Garland's ""native novelist"" representing the ""vanquished"" regions of the nation. Pluralism's elasticity, however, reaches its representational limit with Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton's use of the term ""vanquished"" to describe the Mexicans who lost their land in post-1848 California and Mary Church Terrell's 1903 alternative walking narrative of Washington, D.C. The epilogue explores the development of contemporary socialist renditions of multiculturalism. These renditions show a counter-hegemonic genealogy of pluralism, which still continues among certain cultural workers today.",304118100,,Dissertations & Theses," Bramen, Carrie A. TiradoBramenA.

It considers as well the active part union men and women played in shaping the direction particular unions took regarding ""women's issues,"" protective labor legislation, and equal rights legislation. This project examine how workers constructed these concerns within labor's ranks and why certain contemporary concerns such as comparable worth moved to the forefront of union agendas by the late 1970s. This dissertation presents case studies and overview chapters in a chronological fashion. Early chapters provide historical background to the growing call by many for gender equality in the 1945-63 period in the form of equal pay demands. At the same time, the accelerating trend of automation undercut the rationale for protectionism by eliminating the ""heavy"" job elements used to justify preventing women from taking ""men's"" jobs. The growing rhetoric of equality from the civil rights movement gave rank-and-file members a framework with which to demand their rights as women. These women used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964's ban on sex discrimination in employment to file discrimination charges against their unions and employers. They protested against protectionism and helped usher in the law of equality. The core of this dissertation consists of case studies of two unions: the United Packinghouse Workers and the International Union of Electrical Workers. While the packinghouse union men displayed a ""confrontationist"" approach to quality demands, the electrical unionists exhibited an ""accomodationist"" perspective. This is explained by the two organizations' distinct industrial structure, membership composition, institutional structure, and political history.",304122831,,Dissertations & Theses," Deslippe, Dennis ArthurDeslippeArthurDennisDeslippe, Dennis Arthur", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740928751 , 29375351 , 66569 , 9433620 , 9433620", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304122831?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0510 Labor economics , 0398 Law"," 0337 American history , 0510 Labor economics , 0398 Law"," 0337 American history , 0510 Labor economics , 0398 Law",," 0337 American history , 0510 Labor economics , 0398 Law"," American history , Labor economics , Law"," Social sciences , equal employment opportunity , unions , women workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Rights%2C+not+roses%22%3A+Women%2C+industrial+unions%2C+and+the+law+of+equality+in+the+United+States%2C+1945-1980&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deslippe%2C+Dennis+Arthur&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3470,Reinventing nature: Science narratives as myths for an endangered planet,"This dissertation is a philosophical and ethical inquiry into the possibilities of a mythological treatment of the modern scientific cosmology in light of global environmental crises. I develop a method for this project by examining science as a philosophical and moral problem following the critiques of empiricism by Hilary Putnam and Thomas Kuhn, and then turning to radical deconstructions of science by Sandra Harding, Cornell West, and others. This discussion sets the stage for a shift to a hermeneutical approach to the sciences which I develop with the help of Paul Ricoeur. The dynamics of interpretation are extended in ways that illuminate the impact of metaphors, models and paradigm shifts on the content and culture of science. This social-biophysical hermeneutics better accounts for the actual phenomena of science, nature, and society, and provides pragmatic and productive possibilities for mythically ""reinventing nature"" as a way to reinvent human thought and behavior in this moment of evolutionary crisis. I then explore in The Universe Story by Thomas Berry and Brian Swimme as an example of a new mythological approach to modern science. The authors ""read"" the scientific cosmology as a value-laden natural history which present humans with guidance at a moment of crisis in evolution. The three-fold Cosmogenetic Principle of differentiation, autopoiesis, and communion becomes a description of all phenomena at all moments in the evolutionary epic and a prescription for human adaptation strategies at the end of the Cenozoic era. I then reassess this discussion with the help of Donna Haraway on the basis of a radical postmodern hermeneutics that looks with suspicion on ""one-true stories"" as counter to emancipatory struggles. Haraway helps to more deeply ground this project within the power-charged dynamics of a hermeneutical conversation between human and nonhuman agents. I conclude with a hermeneutical conversation as a model for human-nature thought and behavior that promotes an environmental ethics and inspires an eco-justice movement of voluntary simplicity. This remythologization of science offers theoretical and motivational models for reinventing nature and ourselves in a mutually enhancing and sustainable manner.",304127723,,Dissertations & Theses," Grassie, William JohnGrassieJohnWilliamGrassie, William John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741428961 , 29140151 , 66569 , 9512823 , 9512823", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304127723?accountid=14496," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0768 Environmental science"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0768 Environmental science"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0768 Environmental science",," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0768 Environmental science"," Religion , Philosophy , Environmental science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Health and environmental sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reinventing+nature%3A+Science+narratives+as+myths+for+an+endangered+planet&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grassie%2C+William+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3471,"The culture of conquest: The British colonists and Nova Scotia, 1690-1759. (Volumes I and II)","The topic of this dissertation, in the broadest terms, is the origin of Manifest Destiny. More narrowly it explores why the British colonists decided to acquire territory in New France, and their debate over how to treat the people who lived there. Before the middle years of the eighteenth century, the English settlers who agitated for expansion advanced specific reasons for their projects and in general pleaded self-defense. The New Englanders, mindful of Old Testament strictures against wars of conquest, never claimed that acquiring territory was a good thing in itself. During the second third of the eighteenth century, growing trans-Atlantic contacts changed the outlook of many New Englanders. Some of them came to see their accomplishments as part of a global movement, the expansion of the British Empire. Others adopted an equally imperialistic religious outlook. With respect to Nova Scotia (the old French colony of Acadia), the policies endorsed by these expansionists constituted a huge social experiment. By resettling the Acadians in nine of the thirteen colonies, they hoped to assimilate them, despite their French background and Catholicism, into British colonial society. The supporters of this policy used force to make the exiled Acadians join Protestant, English-speaking communities. Many of the Acadians fled to Canada and others to Louisiana, but by 1783 those who remained on the seaboard were recognized as citizens of the United States. Contrary to expectations, not all of them had become Protestants, but Catholicism was no longer an insurmountable barrier to entry into Anglo-American society. Expansionism, religious toleration, and racism had become inextricably linked. The Micmacs, the Indian inhabitants of Nova Scotia, were not treated as kindly as the Acadians. Beginning in 1749 the provincial government offered bounties for their scalps. The stated objective of this policy was to make room for white Protestant settlers. In the mid-eighteenth century, for the first time, Anglo-American political leaders argued that conquest was a mark of human progress and that the spread of Anglo-American culture justified exterminating the Indians. They self-consciously put these ideas into practice in Nova Scotia.",304128793,,Dissertations & Theses," Plank, Geoffrey GilbertPlankGilbertGeoffreyPlank, Geoffrey Gilbert", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741277171 , 28867071 , 66569 , 9505125 , 9505125", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304128793?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history",," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," Canadian history , American history"," Social sciences , Puritanism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+culture+of+conquest%3A+The+British+colonists+and+Nova+Scotia%2C+1690-1759.+%28Volumes+I+and+II%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Plank%2C+Geoffrey+Gilbert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3472,"On the frontiers of empire: British administration in Kenya's Northern Frontier District, 1905-1935","This thesis is a study of British administration in Kenya's Northern Frontier District (NFD) between 1905 and 1935. It examines the colonial policies and institutions which governed the mainly pastoral African societies who inhabited the frontier region. This work argues that the colonial authorities treated the NFD much differently than the rest of Kenya and that, because of the administration's absorption with ""law and order,"" the province's political and economic development was neglected. It is based primarily on British archival sources including the correspondence between Kenya governors and the Colonial Office in London and official records which originated from within the frontier administration. This work surveys developments in northern Kenya during the nineteenth century as well as the political, economic, and social institutions of the peoples who inhabited the region at that time. It examines the extension of colonialism into the north and the emergence of a frontier policy on the part of the British colonial administration. The problems of policing the border region form a major part of this thesis. Accordingly, this study considers brigandage, inter-ethnic raiding, and the movement of peoples across international boundaries in detail. This thesis also analyzes the means and instruments of colonial control in the NFD. The land dispute between the Samburu and European settlers over the Leroghi plateau is discussed. Finally, this work probes issues associated with the imposition of taxation throughout the NFD as well as the impact of colonial policies on the economic development of the region.",304131328,,Dissertations & Theses," Simpson, George Lawrence, Jr.SimpsonLawrenceGeorgeJr.Simpson, George Lawrence, Jr.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 747269071 , 29870901 , 66569 , 9427991 , 9427991", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304131328?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0335 European history"," 0331 African history , 0335 European history"," 0331 African history , 0335 European history",," 0331 African history , 0335 European history"," African history , European history"," Social sciences , colonialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+frontiers+of+empire%3A+British+administration+in+Kenya%27s+Northern+Frontier+District%2C+1905-1935&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Simpson%2C+George+Lawrence%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3473,International competitiveness and its implications on industrial policy,"A substantial change has taken place over the last two decades in the trade patterns and distribution of economic and industrial capacity among the United States, Western Europe and Japan. This is increasingly attributed to a movement to the ""fifth Kondratiev cycle"" from the oil-based old technological regime to what is called the ""New Techno-Economic Paradigm"" based on microelectronics. In the context of this new paradigm, the question of external trade has been transformed into the question of competitiveness, measured by the ability of a country to develop and produce what are called ""new technology goods"". For a country to compete successfully in the global markets, inputs that are deficient can be remedied by appropriate policy measures to promote the production of these goods. This study analyzes the question of competitiveness within this new paradigm, taking the case of Malaysia. It is found that Malaysia is competitive in the trade of these new technology goods, defined to be comprised of the Standard International Trade Classifications (SITC) 5, 7 and 8. The behavior of the underlying inputs that are crucial to the production of these goods are analyzed, while simultaneously, the arguments of the new paradigm of the importance of technology in the production process are verified. The translog GNP function is used to analyze the behavior of these inputs and other macroeconomic variables. Imports are treated as variable inputs, while domestic factors as fixed inputs. Since the general results of the model are found to be consistent with previous empirical findings, further disaggregation is subsequently done. Imports of new technology goods and human capital inputs are found to be important for the production in this sector, and they behave as substitutes, reflecting the fact that imported technologies are substitutable to domestic technologies. Physical and human capital are found to be complements, while capital and labor are found to change from substitutes to complements, a new phenomenon in recent empirical findings. The implications of these results on policy are then derived in a more comprehensive method, encompassing the economic, social and institutional aspects of policy-making.",304132556,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohd.

Chapter two examined the many changes in America in the period before and including World War Two and how Christian preaching in America responded. Major phenomena examined include global political alliances, the rise of ecumenism, the Great Depression, the New Deal, the fundamentalist-modernist debates, the social gospel movement, and the development of commercial radio and religious broadcasting. Chapter three focused on ecumenical and liberal Christian use of radio. Mainline Protestants interested in using radio joined Jewish and Catholic organizations and received free network airtime through arrangements established by the Federal Council of Churches. Harry Emerson Fosdick's use of radio was examined historically and rhetorically. Aristotelian analysis was applied to four wartime radio sermons that dealt with the topics of war and peace. It was discovered that Fosdick's rhetorical success was due largely to his use of logos and ability to speak directly to relevant concerns of listeners. Chapter four examined the conservative Christian response to radio. The arrangement between the Federal Council of Churches and NBC and CBS created a liberal Protestant monopoly that angered conservative evangelicals. They responded by establishing their own broadcasting facilities and by purchasing time on individual stations and Mutual Broadcasting System. A study of Father Charles Coughlin followed. Coughlin devised his own ""network"" of stations and used his program for political advantage.

The expectations of sociological, feminist difference, risk perception, and structural political theories are tested against the empirical evidence. This research examines the aggregate gender differences in opinions on the use of conventional military force and on the testing, deployment, and use of nuclear weapons. It finds large, stable, and significant gender gaps on security policy attitudes, which persist from World War II to the Gulf War in both nations. Significantly more men than women supported the use of force in international affairs. Males also had higher levels of knowledge and of self-reported awareness, attention, and interest in foreign and nuclear policy issues. Females perceived greater risks and expected worse consequences from military and defense policies. More women than men thought that the chances of war were high, and they expressed more worry about war also. There is no particular growth or decrease in the size of gender differences over time on most issues. Neither changing social and economic roles of women nor the women's movement has affected the bivariate gender gaps. Multivariate analyses of the 1990-91 American National Election Study (NES) demonstrate significant independent influences of gender upon opinions about US involvement in the Gulf War. Political efficacy, partisanship, and attentiveness also differentially influence the opinions of women and men. Mothering, feminist ideology, education, and age do not have significant, consistent impacts. Socially constructed roles for women and men and structural impediments to the equal political participation of women in security policy-making explain these gender gaps in public attitudes. These causal factors are likely to persist in western societies, so that gender differences on war and peace issues will continue in the future. These attitudinal differences have implications for voting, political participation, activism, elite recruitment, and the democratic politics of foreign policy-making.",304138819,,Dissertations & Theses," Brandes, Lisa Catherine OlgaBrandesCatherine OlgaLisaBrandes, Lisa Catherine Olga", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741988291 , 29378181 , 66569 , 9522721 , 9522721", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304138819?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," International law , International relations , Political science , Womens studies", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+opinion%2C+international+security+policy%2C+and+gender%3A+The+United+States+and+Great+Britain+since+1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brandes%2C+Lisa+Catherine+Olga&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3476,"Critical intellectuals and the new media: Bernward Vesper, Ulrike Meinhof, the Frankfurt School and the Red Army Faction","The Red Army Faction (RAF) originated in the international crisis of the 1960's. The urban guerrilla movement they instigated was modeled on Third World insurrections. It was also determined by the exigencies of the political environment created in Western Europe by the ascendancy of the electronic media. The role of the traditional intellectual, what Foucault called the ""universal intellectual,"" generally a ""man of letters,"" became problematic with the rise of television, the post-war reorganization of the economy, the process of decolonization and the feminist challenge to patriarchal authority. The crisis of the universal intellectual was simultaneously a crisis of writing as a critical institution. Bernward Vesper responded to this crisis by integrating the use of hallucinogenic drugs and mechanical recording devices into the writing process. The result was the creation of a written text, Die Reise, that simulated the effects of LSD. Ulrike Meinhof, who made her name as a critical journalist, attempted to overcome the limitations of her work through forays into radio and television culminating in her teleplay, ""Bambule."" However, her involvement in the founding of the RAF ultimately overshadowed her experiments in the electronic media. The urban guerrilla transformed her body and the bodies of her comrades into a political medium which made West Germany's political situation visible. These bodies also became political weapons through which a struggle for liberation was waged. This corporal transformation was a reaction against authoritarian aggression and the result of an interaction with critical social thought particularly that of the Frankfurt School. Theory, in order to be revolutionary, had to change bodies; it had to make bodies resistant to hegemonic systems of power and oppression. The RAF attempted both to produce a theory that would have this effect and, through their actions, to demonstrate the appropriate transformations a revolutionary body should undergo. The trace of the group, photographic and otherwise, became the privileged site of their struggle by providing a core for a new, radical identity. The trace also marked the convergence of the RAF's political desire with sexual desire, highlighting the threat of women as militant revolutionary leaders.",304145028,,Dissertations & Theses," Grant, Matthew ToddGrantToddMatthewGrant, Matthew Todd", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745514381 , 29888381 , 66569 , 9409578 , 9409578", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304145028?accountid=14496," 0311 Germanic literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0615 Political science"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0615 Political science"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0615 Political science",," 0311 Germanic literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0615 Political science"," Germanic literature , European history , Motion Pictures , Political science"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Meinhof, Ulrike , Vesper, Bernward , intellectuals",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Critical+intellectuals+and+the+new+media%3A+Bernward+Vesper%2C+Ulrike+Meinhof%2C+the+Frankfurt+School+and+the+Red+Army+Faction&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grant%2C+Matthew+Todd&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3477,Olympic power plays: A social analysis of CTV's production of the 1988 Winter Olympic ice hockey tournament,"This dissertation is a study of the Canadian Television Network's (CTV) production of the 1988 Winter Olympic ice hockey tournament. A critical cultural studies analysis of the production site, the crew, Olympic and network decision makers is conducted on a number of levels including the political, economic and cultural spheres of broadcasting. On the broadest political-economic level, Olympic broadcasting is analyzed to question how Canada's national private network strategically employed Olympic hockey as a spectacle of accumulation to boost ratings, expand market positioning, strengthen their media monopoly, and attract national sponsors while blocking national broadcast competitors. To study the political-economic level, three methods are utilized including (1) interviews with network and Olympic officials, (2) document analysis of media and Olympic policies, papers, memos and texts, and (3) ethnographic observation of the media officials in the Broadcast Centre and at the SaddleDome hockey venue. Ethnographic observation of the labour process of the CTV hockey crew at the arena, informed by the semiotic insights of critical communication studies, provides the second level of understanding, Olympic broadcasting as a spectacle of legitimation. These observations illustrate how the crew re-make the live sporting event into a series of cultural images to ""sell"" the national audience. These images are compatible with the commercial and sporting ideologies of the ""Olympic family"" (including the International Olympic Committee, media rights holders and exclusive sponsors), and broadcasts that are compatible with mythologies of the unofficial Canadian ""national game"". The ethnographic elements of production appraised in this study include the division of media labour, crew relations, social-aesthetic use of broadcast technology, the conventional employment of sporting codes of commentary and visual codes of television mediation. Despite covering a losing Team Canada, which had been positioned as a medal hopeful by CTV programmers prior to the 1988 Games, this study demonstrates how the television crew laboured to reclaim hockey as ""the"" Canadian sport in order to reassert a self-proclaimed superiority in producing the television feed for all world broadcasters. The work to create Olympic telecast images of the sporting spectacle is revealed to be a social process that legitimates select systems of meaning, reinforces particular modes of media production and strengthens monopolistic political-economic relationships: the circuit of cultural production constructs a profoundly patriotic and patriarchal version of hockey that momentarily serves the economic and marketing interests of the CTV network and the Olympic movement, while reproducing the cultural-economic power of the National Hockey League as the hockey reference system for broadcasting spectacles of this game.",304158321,,Dissertations & Theses," MacNeill, Margaret E.MacNeillE.MargaretMacNeill, Margaret E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741436371 , 28561861 , 66569 , 9780612011397 , 0612011399 , NN01139 , NN01139", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994," 9780612011397 , 0612011399", English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304158321?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation"," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation"," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation",," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation"," Mass media , Canadian history , Recreation"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Alberta , Canadian Television Network , Winter Olympics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Olympic+power+plays%3A+A+social+analysis+of+CTV%27s+production+of+the+1988+Winter+Olympic+ice+hockey+tournament&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MacNeill%2C+Margaret+E.&amp;isbn=9780612011397&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3478,"Interpretive adult education: Language and lifelong learning in university, industry, and community settings in Hawaii and Singapore","This study investigates the sociocultural aspects and transformative process of language and lifelong learning programs in Hawaii and Singapore. As Pacific Rim island communities, Hawaii and Singapore were chosen because they are rich in cultural diversity, and they have active adult education programs. The interpretive nature of language and lifelong learning and the implications for adult education are examined through analysis of conversations with seven adult educators in Hawaii and seven in Singapore. Three categories guided the research conversations with the participants: (1) the interpretive nature of language, (2) the role of tradition and culture in learning, and (3) lifelong learning as transformation. Critical hermeneutics was used as the theoretical basis for this research study. The text developed during the conversations with the participants was transcribed and analyzed using the philosophical tenets of Gadamer, Habermas, Heidegger, and Ricoeur. This hermeneutic field-based research methodology was utilized as a process for reaching new understandings and actualizing meaning. The results of this research show: (1) The future for adult education is a movement to interpretive adult education. Adult education is socially and culturally constructed with lifelong learning and language as foundations. (2) Understanding of traditional values is essential for communication in conversation or discourse. (3) The distinction between East and West cultural values is a primary concern for participants. (4) Sociocultural issues encourage educators to focus on understanding how relationship creates an opportunity for student understanding and transformation. Both Hawaii and Singapore would benefit from developing an understanding of core cultural values that represent the people as community, irrespective of race or religion. A shared vision would join the Asian-Pacific region and enhance the meaning and understanding of these core values. A global interdependence that highlights the similarities of the Pacific region and the common economic aspirations can connect people in these geographical areas. This common concern can create a cultural bridge built for the betterment of these geographical and social neighbors. To accomplish a transformation to interpretive adult education, educators can shift from thinking of education as merely information-giving to education that emphasizes relationship, understanding, and lifelong learning.",304166615,,Dissertations & Theses," Stafford, AvisStaffordAvisStafford, Avis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740814011 , 28534191 , 66569 , 9433229 , 9433229", Dissertation/Thesis, 1994,, English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304166615?accountid=14496," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0998 Educational theory"," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0998 Educational theory"," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0998 Educational theory",," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0998 Educational theory"," Adult education , Continuing education , Bilingual education , Multicultural education , Educational theory", Education,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interpretive+adult+education%3A+Language+and+lifelong+learning+in+university%2C+industry%2C+and+community+settings+in+Hawaii+and+Singapore&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stafford%2C+Avis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3479,"The life and thought of jacques ellul with special reference to his writings on law, violence, the state, and politics","This thesis presents an original interpretation of the life and thought of Jacques Ellul, one of the most important contributors to contemporary Christian social and political thought. Based on the most comprehensive research of the primary source material undertaken to date, it clarifies the context, structure, central content, and coherence of his thought as a whole and also examines in detail certain aspects of his social and political thought. It argues that Ellul is a revolutionary dissenter whose personalist convictions and faith in Jesus Christ made him a radical critic of modernity. His writings analyse the modern world and study Scripture in order to encourage others to understand and revolt against the catastrophic path taken by twentieth century man and to incarnate the word of God in the contemporary world. The thesis has a bipartite structure comprising a ""macro-analysis"" which offers a global reading of Ellul ( Part One ) and a ""micro-analysis"" which presents individual case-studies of four subjects central to his social and political thought ( Part Two ). PART ONE offers a detailed biography of Ellul and a brief outline of the origins, structure, and purpose of his corpus ( chapter one ). Ellul's theology and ethics are interpreted by focussing on the relationship between God and the world in terms of communion and rupture ( chapter two ). His sociology is shown to originate in the 1930s personalist movement and to have as its central themes the novelty of modernity, the crisis of civilization, and the dominance of Technique ( chapter three ). A short conclusion discusses the dialectical relationship between his sociology and his theology ( chapter four ). PART TWO examines four important themes in Ellul's work which are also significant in the history of Christian political thought and modern political theology and social ethics: law ( chapter five ), violence ( chapter six ), and the state and politics ( chapter seven ).

In insect social behaviour, the interactions among individuals that communicate and respond to the presence of other individuals within the same colony, generate new global phenomena such as the ""group effects"" or ""social facilitation"" where patterns of behaviour different from those observed in individuals arise solely because of the interactions. In this study, this phenomenon has been examined both theoretically and empirically in ants and in termites. Ants show changes in the dynamics of the colony activity as the nest density varies, while termites attain large survival rate as a function of group size. Theory and experiments are discussed. The second part of this thesis is concerned with the study of host-parasitoid models that exhibit complex dynamics such as chaos and spatial self-organization. Chaos via a quasiperiodic route is shown to exist in many well-known host-parasitoid population models. Furthermore, it is shown that this kind of route to chaos is less unaffected than others under the presence of immigration. Host-parasitoid models with explicit spatial dimension are analysed to study the consequences of density dependent parasitoid movement. Finally, the equilibrium stability consequences of dispersal in metapopulation models are explored.

Migration is studied here within a conceptual framework of mode of production, relations of production, hegemony, and cash nexus. The historical aspects of migration are acknowledged throughout. The thesis then studies the theories of migration that are available and traces their developments. In this process, the thesis discovers ideology in many migration theories and literature. It selects three specific problematics of the postwar migration, named as 'zonal imbalance', 'mother country' migration, heavy representation of people who form lower SEGs. By examining these three closely, the thesis reveals many erroneous conception and notions about the postwar migration. In this process, the thesis rejects 'individualistic' and 'voluntary' actions in postwar migration. For the empirical part, Bangalee migration from Bangladesh to Britain has been chosen for its typicality and other reasons. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods have been used. Two control groups, one in Britain, (migrants) and another in Bangladesh (non-migrants, who had had the opportunity to migrate at some point in time, but did not) have been studied in as much depth as possible. The findings of the experience of the respondents are offered in relation to the historical evidence, particularly the relations of production in Bangladesh, and migration history of Bangladesh. Despite the basis of a small universe used in this research, international and historical persepectives have always been borne in mind. The objective remained the study of the totality of migration. Having taken the views of those who did not migrate (non-migrants) at a time when 'everyone was going', this research can claim to be a unique way of exploring a sociological phenomenon by negative investigation. The concluding part is in two chapters. In the first, the thesis has attempted to develop four new categories of migration to end the debate who can or cannot be called a migrant. It then exposes the myths of migration. Having established that socio-cultural transition migration, which is one of the four categories developed in this chapter, is the major concern of most migration studies, the thesis argues that a subtle process of 'branding' exists in the matters of encouraging migration to a country, whether the country is situated in the 'First World' or in the NICs. In fact, since '90s, the trends in the global population movements have changed so rapidly and radically that all older theories fail to explain the new phenomenon. The thesis argues that in order to understand 'migration', one has to study the changes that have occured in the social relations, emanating from changes in their relations of production. Finally, the thesis asserts that the phenomenon of human migration can possibly be explained within the conceptual framework chosen. It concludes that social relations play a major role in migration and offers a definition towards developing a sociological theory of migration.",301482582,,Dissertations & Theses," Alam, FazlulAlamFazlulAlam, Fazlul", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757500441 , 44616921 , 101309 , U089113 , U089113 , http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/585/", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301482582?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/585/ , (UMI)AAIU089113 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+relations+and+migration%3A+a+study+of+post-war+migration+with+particular+reference+to+migration+from+bangladesh+to+britain&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alam%2C+Fazlul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3482,"Sustainable urban development in the kampung improvement programme: a case study of jakarta, indonesia","Recently, ""sustainable development"" has become the key concept in the integration of environmental and economic policy. However, little literature considers the links between sustainable development and urban development. This research focuses on these concepts and attempts to develop the term sustainable urban development through an investigation of the ""Kampung Improvement Programme (KIP)"", and particularly, a case study of Jakarta - Indonesia. The main objectives of the research are to examine the sustainability of KIPMIlT in Jakarta, specifically to analyse the physical, economic, social and environmental characteristics that positively affect urban systems and should be considered as a component of sustainable urban development as a means of improving quality of life and standards of living. The analysis is based on the data collected from two types of kampung areas: improved kampungs and unimproved kampungs. Moreover, each of these have two types of surveys: the household survey which examines the extent of movement of the people to the urban kampungs and their physical, social and economic living conditions; and the leadership survey which examines the extent to which kampungs settlers have participation, opinions, perception and satisfaction in the KIP. The study concludes that the impact of KIP of the kampung study areas in Jakarta has been to improve not only the physical and environment conditions but also the social and economic conditions of the people as a means of increasing the standards of living and improving the quality of life. In considering the implications of these findings on sustainable urban development in Jakarta, it is shown that the KIP has been concerned with the creation of balanced urban development which does not jeopardise future generations. It is based on social, economic, physical and environment activities, and integrated approach among the government, community participation and international agencies.",301499735,,Dissertations & Theses," Djajadiningrat, Hasan MustafaDjajadiningratMustafaHasanDjajadiningrat, Hasan Mustafa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757406521 , 44592251 , 101309 , U079562 , U079562 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/14841/", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301499735?accountid=14496, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0999 Urban planning, Urban planning," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/14841/ , (UMI)AAIU079562 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustainable+urban+development+in+the+kampung+improvement+programme%3A+a+case+study+of+jakarta%2C+indonesia&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Djajadiningrat%2C+Hasan+Mustafa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3483,"Intellectuals, political power and emancipation from Marx to the October Revolution.","The introductory chapter of the work sheds light on the philosophical background of the intellectual-question. To this end, the author draws critical arguments from classical works such as Plato's Republic , Aristotle's Politics , Rousseau's On the Social Contract , focusing his attention on the tension arising among intellectual vanguard, on the one hand, political power and emancipation, on the other. Given this philosophical frame of reference, the first part of the study constitutes a critical presentation of Marx's and Engel's commitment to the proletarian movement of the 1840s with special emphasis on their role in the Communist League. According to the author the fact that Marx and Engels finally entered the League represents a decisive turn from the role of the philosopher-interpreter and educator to the role of the philosopher-lawgiver and governor. The second part of this work deals with the participation of Marx, Engels and Bakunin in the First International and, furthermore, with the Marx-Bakunin controversy. The indisputable datum that Marx and Engels were against a Blanquist or a Bakuninist type of elite organisation, the author suggests, does not mean that they were against any kind of intellectual and political vanguard. In fact, the author argues, intellectual leadership and proletarian self-emancipation do not necessarily contradict each other. To support this argument, a direct juxtaposition has been suggested between Marx's and Engel's aristodemocratic version of the intellectual-people relation and Bakunin's apparently ultra-libertarian and actually quasi-dictatorial approach to the same relation. The third part of the study includes a further analysis of the intellectual-question, as this was posed in the framework of the European proletarian movement, and a critical presentation of the Russian Populist and Social Democratic intelligentsia. Moreover, the author takes advantage of the aristodemocracy-concept in order to evaluate particular versions of the intellectual-proletarian relation as appeared in the field of the Russian Populism and Marxism during the end of the nineteenth and the early years of the twentieth century.",301550434,,Dissertations & Theses," Chryssis, A.A.ChryssisA.A.Chryssis, A.A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757368371 , 44583231 , 101309 , U072183 , U072183", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301550434?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU072183 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intellectuals%2C+political+power+and+emancipation+from+Marx+to+the+October+Revolution.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chryssis%2C+A.A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3484,The impact of external shocks upon a peripheral economy: war and oil in twentieth century Shetland.,"This thesis, within the context of the impact of external shocks on a peripheral economy, offers a soci-economic analysis of the effects of both World Wars and North Sea oil upon Shetland. The assumption is, especially amongst commentators of oil, that the impact of external shocks upon a peripheral economy will be disruptive of equilibrium, setting in motion changes which would otherwise not have occurred. By questioning the classic core-periphery debate, and re-assessing the position of Shetland - an island location labelled 'peripheral' because of the traditional nature of its economic base and distance from the main centres of industrial production - it is possible to challenge this supposition. This thesis attempt a comparison of both the economic and social effects of the three major shocks, deploying oral sources as well as more conventional quantitative material. The thesis questions whether Shetland's apparent 'peripherality' has any historical foundations. Greater exposure to the world through trade, seafaring travel and emigration ensured that the three external shocks of this century had less permanent social consequences than may have been anticipated. Both World Wars brought naval and military personnel to Shetland, and saw the movement out of men and women from the isles. War experiences and contact with 'outsiders' had some effects on the attitudes and ideas of Shetlanders. But it is difficult to separate these from more long-term cultural change. In contrast, a great deal of concern was expressed over the social impact of North Sea oil, since the perceived vulnerability of this society, and its supposed unique features captured national and international interest. It was feared that the 'traditional way of life', arguably only devised as a reaction to oil, was under threat. But, as Shetland's history shows, it is not as susceptible to change as many may think, and represents a resilient society when exposed to external shocks.",301568693,,Dissertations & Theses," Black, B.A.BlackB.A.Black, B.A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757336731 , 44575551 , 101309 , U072301 , U072301", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301568693?accountid=14496, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics,, 0503 Agricultural economics, Agricultural economics," (UMI)AAIU072301 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+external+shocks+upon+a+peripheral+economy%3A++war+and+oil+in+twentieth+century+Shetland.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Black%2C+B.A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3485,International cooperation and the rules of change: A neo-institutional approach to the Helsinki process,"The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe has been an important agent of international cooperation and change. The present analysis spans from 1975, the year in which the CSCE was established, to 1990, the year in which the CSCE was endowed with a permanent organizational structure. This early CSCE phase is known as ""the Helsinki process"". The present study looks at the impact of this process upon the end of the Cold War in Europe. The analysis begins with a critique of traditional regime theory and justifies the adoption of a neo-institutional approach to the study of the CSCE. What the author calls a neo-institutional approach (1) puts the evolution of a regime or its historical development at the center of analysis and (2) focuses on the interaction between international institutions and non-governmental organizations--respectively ""above"" and ""below"" the level of the state. The author maintains that well grounded institutions are ones which exert a broad societal impact. The main assumption is that the more ""informal"" an institution, the broader its societal impact. This appreciation of informality stems from the consideration of the ""constitutive"" and/or transformational nature of institutional rules. To this effect, the author suggests that institutions be seen, first and foremost, as ""rule-making"" processes. The study is divided into three parts. The first part focuses on the formation of CSCE rules through a linguistic analysis of the main CSCE text: the Helsinki Final Act. The second part looks at the actual impact of CSCE rules, through an analysis of the principal social practices and/or epistemic communities which emerged in the wake of the Final Act. The third part looks at the recent transformation of the CSCE into a ""formal"" organization (OSCE). Empirical findings confirm the author's main contention that the Helsinki process or institution exerted a broad societal impact. This impact was facilitated by the informality of the process, which stimulated participation ""from below""--of peace movements and human rights groups in particular--while triggering a merging of NGO discourses in support of the main Helsinki idea of a linkage between security and human rights. This linkage worked to undermine the Cold War in Europe--or the legitimacy of the political-military status quo--as it was perceived and sustained by society at large as the basis of a new, more humane security ""order-to-be"" beyond the East-West divide.",304155482,,Dissertations & Theses," Visentin, AnnamariaVisentinAnnamariaVisentin, Annamaria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742868051 , 30100511 , 66569 , 9623257 , 9623257", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304155482?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," International law , International relations , Political science , European history"," Social sciences , Cold War , Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=International+cooperation+and+the+rules+of+change%3A+A+neo-institutional+approach+to+the+Helsinki+process&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Visentin%2C+Annamaria&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3486,"Dependency, development, and ethnic mobilization","Over the last quarter century many countries in the world have witnessed the reemergence of ethnic mobilization in the political arena. The present study analyzes the impact of external factors, such as dependency on other nations, and internal factors, like modernization and a history of ethnic conflict, on ethnic political mobilization. According to dependency theorists, economic, political, and military dependency affect state policies which perpetuate ethnic inequalities leading to ethnic political mobilization. From the competition perspective, the study investigates whether indicators of development impact state authority and its policies, which in turn provoke ethnic mobilization. The study also assesses the impact of a history of ethnic conflict on contemporary ethnic mobilization. The effects of the history of ethnic conflict, dependency, and development were analyzed in a cross-national model in two sub-populations of fifty and eighty countries. Data for the independent variables were drawn from World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators III: 1948-1977. Ethnic mobilization was conceptualized in terms of types of ethnic organizations and their activities to achieve their goals. A content analysis of the information contained in Revolutionary and Dissident Movements: An International Guide (1988) and World Encyclopedia of Political Systems and Parties Volume 1 and Volume 2: 1983 was conducted to gather information on ethnic mobilization. Multiple regression analysis and path analysis produced assessments of the direct and indirect affects of a history of ethnic conflict, dependency, and development on the endogenous variables of state efficacy, communication resources, ethnic inequality, and ethnic mobilization. The history of ethnic conflict had a direct positive and a significant impact on the mobilization of ethnic political organizations. Import dependency, export dependency, and debt dependency had significant positive effects on ethnic mobilization. Urbanization had positive effect on mobilization of ethnic groups. State efficacy, communication resources, political,and economic discrimination had significant positive effects on ethnic mobilization. Path analysis revealed that the direct effects of the exogenous variables on ethnic mobilization were greater in magnitude compared to their indirect effect in the sub-population of fifty and eighty countries.

Through its medical programs, the Foundation sought to export scientific knowledge and methods in a scientific institution--the American research-based medical school. The Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) serves as a prism to study the diverse spectrum of ideas and approaches, American and Chinese, involved in the development of educational and social reform in modern China; these ideas and approaches are interpreted in their respective historical contexts, with hopes of increasing the understanding of cultural exchange programs in general. There was no single voice in the Rockefeller Foundation's program in China; missionaries and American professionals were the most influential. While the missionaries inspired the Foundation's interest in China, their opinion of medical science often clashed with the Foundation's scientific philanthropy. On the other hand, in the early 20th century, professionals, particularly medical professionals, profoundly influenced the foundations' policy-making. An international version of the Foundation's domestic scientific philanthropy, the PUMC was based on the notion that science along with institutional development was a powerful dynamic for social progress and reform. The Rockefeller Foundation's effort to change China intertwined with reforms promoted by key Chinese leaders. This study analyzes an important aspect of China's modern reform: the development of scientific direction. The Foundation's scientific approach converged with the Chinese new intellectuals' campaign for science and their criticism of the old culture and traditional medicine. The PUMC was the Foundation's response to certain Chinese intellectuals, most with Western educational backgrounds, who favored gradual reform and Western ideas. Through medical programs and other work, the Foundation established a mutually trusting and mutually influential relationship with this elite group. Their support of the PUMC laid a foundation for this intercultural program; however, limited knowledge of China's reality and bias against Chinese rural problems circumscribed the Rockefeller Foundation's perspective of China's reality.",304174683,,Dissertations & Theses," Ma, QiushaMaQiushaMa, Qiusha", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741686141 , 30645341 , 66569 , 9607914 , 9607914", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304174683?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0520 Education history , 0585 Science history"," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0520 Education history , 0585 Science history"," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0520 Education history , 0585 Science history",," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0520 Education history , 0585 Science history"," American history , History , Education history , Science history"," Social sciences , Education , missionary education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Rockefeller+Foundation+and+modern+medical+education+in+China%2C+1915-1951&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ma%2C+Qiusha&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3488,Global change and paradigm crisis: The renovation of left discourse in Cuba and Mexico,"Through case studies of left intellectuals from Cuba and Mexico, this dissertation explores how major changes in the structures and practices of the world-system have contributed to a paradigm crisis within the left. That crisis has led the left to reformulate its notions of and strategies for the creation of democratic societies and economic alternatives; most notably, the left has been compelled to reconsider the role of the state. The new global circumstances, which constitute the main independent variables, include: the restructuring of the world economy, the demise of liberalism and the ascendancy of neoliberal ideology, and the collapse of the former Soviet bloc. The analysis is informed by theoretical perspectives associated with: (1) the sociology of knowledge, ideology, and intellectuals, and (2) the historical political economy of world-systems theory. It is an empirical account, based primarily on in-depth interviews with seventy-four intellectuals in Cuba and Mexico, a purposive sample selected to reflect the range of relevant political and ideological currents. The interview data is supplemented by an extensive bibliography of current left literature in Latin America. The findings reveal that a chain of world events over the past three decades indeed provoked a great paradigm crisis for the left in Cuba and Mexico, which undid old alignments and produced a new constellation of left discourse. Three ""ideal type"" perspectives are identified among today's left on the questions of democracy and economic alternatives; liberal, orthodox socialist, and renovative. In Cuba, the renovative tendency is important but somewhat fragile, liberalism exerts its greatest influence over ideas about economic reform, and orthodox notions about democracy still prevail. In Mexico, the renovative current is quite strong, liberalism has been most influential in terms of the left's revaluation of democracy, and orthodox statism still informs much of the thinking about economic alternatives. Nationalism remains strong within all left currents. The renovative perspectives identified have importance beyond the left and beyond Latin America, as they suggest new alternatives to the great social crises of today's world. Our conclusions take into account global structures, national culture, divisions within ruling elites, and the left's relationship to state power and popular movements.",304175824,,Dissertations & Theses," McCaughan, Edward JosephMcCaughanJosephEdwardMcCaughan, Edward Joseph", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740911251 , 32280871 , 66569 , 9539501 , 9539501", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304175824?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Sociology , Latin American history , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+change+and+paradigm+crisis%3A+The+renovation+of+left+discourse+in+Cuba+and+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCaughan%2C+Edward+Joseph&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3489,Political foundations of the information society in the European Union: Public space in the information age,"This study of the political significance of the information society in the European Union (EU), demonstrates that the information society for citizens essentially constitutes a systematic dismantling not only of the European public service paradigm of democratic development, but of the very future of political rights in the information age. The political reality of this historical change is assessed in the context of four specific areas of information society policies and laws: (1) telecommunications infrastructure liberalization; (2) intellectual property rights; (3) audiovisual policy; and(4) the constitutional foundation of communication rights. The policy design of the information age is assessed through the following rival conceptions of European public space: (1) the competitive order of information liberalization as a global social movement derived from liberal political foundations; (2) universal service and public service in the European democratic tradition as developed from non-liberal political foundations; (3) nationalism or culturalism in Europe rooted in expressivist political foundations; and (4) the effect on political rights of participation demonstrated in tensions between public constitutional law derived from the Roman-Germanic legal tradition, and private, contractual law derived from the Anglo-American common law legal tradition. The dissertation illustrates two principal arguments regarding the design of the multimedia age: First, as a theoretical and empirical demonstration of Hegel's (1952) concept of the central role law plays in the social order, the study attempts to develop Hegel's political thought into a theory of law founded on a deliberative paradigm. This approach provides a way of examining the legitimacy of modern policy and law for the information society through the requirements of democratic will-formation and of the principles of public reason and political rights of communication. Second, the dissertation argues that contrary to enhanced freedom of consumer choice the information society is supposed to bring about, the study's finding make it evident the multimedia digital age is far from being designed to function as a demand-led environment. Rather, it is held that the granting of absolute liberty for unlimited economies of scale under information liberalization seriously contradicts the terms and arguments of liberalization's own political profession, viz., that it was supposed to deliver a competitive commercial structure rather than a monopolistic one.",304183183,,Dissertations & Theses," Venturelli, Shalini S.VenturelliS.ShaliniVenturelli, Shalini S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742700491 , 31210171 , 66569 , 9613318 , 9613318", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304183183?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0422 Philosophy"," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0422 Philosophy"," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0422 Philosophy",," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0422 Philosophy"," Mass media , International law , International relations , Philosophy"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+foundations+of+the+information+society+in+the+European+Union%3A+Public+space+in+the+information+age&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Venturelli%2C+Shalini+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3490,A network of praying women: The formation of religious identity in Women's Aglow Fellowship,"This thesis examines the lives and narratives of a group of charismatic Christian women and their everyday religious practices, most importantly the practice of prayer, as a way of exploring the construction of religious identities. The group I am examining is Women's Aglow Fellowship International (""Aglow""), an organization that emerged in the 1960s as part of the charismatic renewal movement within American Christianity. Aglow formed in Seattle, Washington, when a small group of pentecostal and charismatic Christian women began meeting together for prayer, worship, and evangelical work. Throughout the 1970s and 80s and into the 1990s, Aglow rapidly expanded, forming hundreds of new chapters across the United States and around the world and establishing a successful publishing industry aimed at ""reaching women for Christ."" My study examines Aglow in the United States as a case study of a religiously conservative women's prayer group, with the intention of contributing to an understanding of how religious practices such as prayer and testimony work in the formation of religious meanings around Christian womanhood, home and family, intimacy, and healing, all of which are then enacted in public as well as private domains. Often associated with the so-called ""religious right""--although not a specifically political organization--Aglow has informal ties to such groups as Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition and Beverly LaHaye's Concerned Women for America, among others. The thesis thus has broader implications for understanding the rise and composition of the new Christian right in recent American history. By analyzing printed and oral narratives, gleaned from literary sources and ethnographic research, the study uses the practice of prayer as a lens through which to view Aglow women's strategic ways of negotiating the circumstances of their daily lives, resisting and even reshaping various cultural and social structures. I argue that prayer itself is a tactical practice, a mode of communication through which the women share stories of suffering as well as one in which they come to feel healed and transformed. Praying together to God for release from pain is a means through which new religious identities are constructed and, they hope, sustained.",304185717,,Dissertations & Theses," Griffith, Ruth MarieGriffithMarieRuthGriffith, Ruth Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740910761 , 32280691 , 66569 , 9539079 , 9539079", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304185717?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history",," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history"," Religion , Womens studies , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , charismatic",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+network+of+praying+women%3A+The+formation+of+religious+identity+in+Women%27s+Aglow+Fellowship&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Griffith%2C+Ruth+Marie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3491,Nazi apocalypticism as a response to rapid and radical change,"Many Nazis perceived Weimar Germany to be a period of chaos, where all political, economic, social and cultural order was turned upside down. This chaos was in turn interpreted as reflecting an imminent apocalypse. They believed that Germany had arrived at a historic turning point, and foresaw the dawn of a New Age--the Third Reich. The Nazis believed themselves to be a chosen elite, led by a God-sent messianic Fuhrer. Their Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler revealed the way to salvation through what I have termed his soteriology of race. It was the divine mission of Aryan humanity to annihilate the ""satanic Jew"" in an eschatological battle that was to be final and decisive. The ""Final Solution"" accomplished, the millennial Third Reich could begin. My research in the cross-cultural and interdisciplinary literature of apocalypticism indicates that it is a global phenomenon occurring across cultural and temporal epochs. The common causal factor among these movements is that all occur in cultures undergoing rapid and radical change. The only factor that can explain such a cross-cultural and atemporal phenomenon is the shared genetic foundation of the human brain, which has changed little for millennia. Therefore I have created a psychohistorical model, utilizing the archetypal theories of C. G. Jung. It is the contention of this thesis that the psychological theories of Jung, which posit an objective psyche, in other words, a psyche which contains non-personal elements, may provide researchers with a much needed tool for analyzing collective behavior in historical contexts. What I have termed the apocalypse complex is a common psychological response to stress generated by rapid and radical change. When societies undergo such drastic changes, normal external ordering factors such as family, work, and social and religious institutions are considerably weakened. The apocalypse complex reconstructs order and gives meaning through the production of a standard set of symbols (messiah, New Age and past Golden Age, eternal peace and prosperity, unity, timelessness). These symbols are reflective of the ordering power of the Self, Jung's psychological construct for the internal ordering factor of the psyche.",304199297,,Dissertations & Theses," Redles, DavidRedlesDavidRedles, David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742699231 , 30670021 , 66569 , 9612818 , 9612818", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304199297?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology",," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology"," European history , History , Religious history , Social psychology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Psychology , Germany",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nazi+apocalypticism+as+a+response+to+rapid+and+radical+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Redles%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3492,"Migration within cities: A study of socioeconomic processes, intra-city migration and grass-roots politics in Jakarta","There is no lack of studies on the contribution of rural-urban migration to the urbanisation process in Southeast Asia. This study goes beyond the common tradition. The huge urban complex of contemporary Jakarta structures the mass migration of the Jakarta's low income groups that takes place within the boundaries of the city. This study thus deals with the basic patterns of intra-city migration and its impact on individual actors, families, and local communities in Jakarta. Based on both secondary and primary data, this study demonstrates that migration within Jakarta is occurring on a massive scale especially if one adds the ""shadow migration"" to officially registered moves. A large proportion of migrants move more than once, but moves tend to occur mainly over short distances. This finding supports the thesis that there is a large ""floating mass"" of low-income persons occupied mainly in the informal sector. These informal sector workers live mostly in kampung areas. This study also registers five primary motives for intra-city migration in Jakarta: kampung demolition, important events in the life-cycle, the search for better communities, the intention to move closer to the work-place, and the construction of a new house. These motives suggest two typologies of intra-city migration: voluntary and involuntary intra-city migration. The involuntary intra-city migration is commonly connected to the process of kampung demolition and community politics in Jakarta. However, these kampung-based urban social protests in Jakarta have not developed into massive urban social and political movement for reasons proposed in the dissertation. The overall framework of this study suggests that intra-city migration is linked to the influence of globalization on the urban economy. This economic dynamic provides jobs and income-earning opportunities but on the other hand keeps people on the move. The poor of Jakarta are thus seen as actors and re-actors in the urbanisation process. On one hand mass intra-city migration is produced by the economic and political structures of Jakarta which are being massively affected by wider arenas of the global economy, on the other hand, the city is being made by the moves and related actions of its people.",304204972,,Dissertations & Theses," Somantri, Gumilar RusliwaSomantriRusliwaGumilarSomantri, Gumilar Rusliwa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741166371 , 32270001 , 66569 , 9544395 , 9544395", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304204972?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0510 Labor economics , 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science"," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0510 Labor economics , 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science"," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0510 Labor economics , 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science",," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0510 Labor economics , 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science"," Social structure , Urban planning , Area planning & development , Labor economics , Geography , Political science , Rural urban migration , Global economy , Studies , Socioeconomic factors , Politics"," Social sciences , Indonesia , grassroots politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migration+within+cities%3A+A+study+of+socioeconomic+processes%2C+intra-city+migration+and+grass-roots+politics+in+Jakarta&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Somantri%2C+Gumilar+Rusliwa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3493,"Domestic reform, structural changes and foreign policy transformation: Structural-institutional contexts of Chinese foreign policy evolution since 1979","Based on a dynamic structural analysis which focuses on structural-institutional connections between different issue and policy sectors during a large scale social transitional period, this dissertation explains China's foreign policy transformation at current period in its contexts with domestic reforms and structural overhaul. China's reforms and structural changes in the past 15 years have altered the domestic condition in which Chinese foreign policy is formed and executed. These changes may not be enough to furnish sufficient conditions for an overall foreign policy restructuring. However, they constitute a significant part of the necessary conditions for Chinese foreign policy transition since 1979. Without domestic reforms and corresponding structural changes, a new Chinese foreign policy as witnessed today would be less possible, if not impossible. As well, Chinese foreign policy in the near future will by and large depend on the continuity of its domestic reforms and structural changes. As long as China adheres to its reform and opening-up policy and China's domestic structural transitions undergo along with the present course, China's foreign policy will be maintained complying with the existing principles and following the current track: open, pragmatical, economic and regional concentrated, flexible, and well under-control. To reorient or overturn such a policy may require an entire overriding of existing domestic conditions, which means to redefine China's national interests and priorities; reconcentrate great deal of resources, at the sacrifice of domestic demands, on military establishment and international adventures; and rebuild an over-centralized or authoritarian national leadership. These will be most unlikely, if not impossible, in the foreseeable future. Structural constraints, after all, are enormous and heavy. Though new developments in Chinese politics in some aspects may create chances for challengers toward the current reform policy and movement, an overriding to the major structural transitions China has so far accomplished will be less likely--the price will be unbearable.",304205749,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, HanwenChenHanwenChen, Hanwen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742871051 , 31426061 , 66569 , 9622038 , 9622038", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304205749?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0332 History"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0332 History"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0332 History",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science , 0332 History"," International law , International relations , Political science , History", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Domestic+reform%2C+structural+changes+and+foreign+policy+transformation%3A+Structural-institutional+contexts+of+Chinese+foreign+policy+evolution+since+1979&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Hanwen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3494,"The drama of Carl Orff: From ""Unerwuenscht"" to postmodernity","The purpose of this study is to serve as an introduction to Carl Orff the dramatist. As a composer of music, Orff is best known for his staged cantata, Carmina Burana. Although Orff's remaining staged works do not enjoy the international fame of Carmina Burana, they continue to be performed, surviving the test of time. This dissertation treats two aspects of Carl Orff's stage works written during the Third Reich. The first area is Orff's dramatic theories. More specifically, how his dramaturgy was influenced by the ""Welttheater"" from Baroque Jesuit plays, the epic theater of Bertolt Brecht and the ""Gesamtkunstwerk"" of Richard Wagner. The second aspect investigates the intriguing role Orff's operas played in the Third Reich. Orff's controversial ""Aryan"" replacement of what the Nazis viewed as Mendelssohn's ""degenerate, Jewish"" Ein Sommernactstraum is one such example. Orff also wrote Die Bernauerin during the Third Reich. This drama, based on the life of the 15th-century political martyr Agnes Bernauer, raises questions about Orff's relationship to the Nazi regime and the regime's relationship to the arts. Orff wrote Die Bernauerin in an old Bavarian dialect with the assistance of Professor Kurt Huber from the University of Munich. Huber, a friend and neighbor of Carl Orff, is most famous for his role in the anti-Nazi movement, ""The White Rose."" Huber was executed in 1943 for his involvement in this underground organization. Despite the association of Huber to Die Bernauerin, the opera was allowed to be performed. Generally, the Nazi leaders afforded Orff quite a lot of freedom. To date, works published that study Orff's operas were overseen or written by Orff personally. These go into no detail on Orff's working relationship with Huber or Brecht, and only superficially into Orff's dramatic theories. Orff wanted such studies to treat his works from a musical standpoint only, illustrating his musical intent Orff's desire to confine studies of his music to these areas is perhaps due to the extreme nature of political and social events of that time.",304206649,,Dissertations & Theses," DCamp, Richard ManleyDCampManleyRichardDCamp, Richard Manley", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742129881 , 30949951 , 66569 , 9536186 , 9536186", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304206649?accountid=14496," 0311 Germanic literature , 0465 Theater , 0413 Music"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0465 Theater , 0413 Music"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0465 Theater , 0413 Music",," 0311 Germanic literature , 0465 Theater , 0413 Music"," Germanic literature , Theater , Music"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Brecht, Bertolt , Huber, Kurt , Orff, Carl",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+drama+of+Carl+Orff%3A++From+%22Unerwuenscht%22+to+postmodernity&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DCamp%2C+Richard+Manley&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3495,Women and citizenship: From a critique of liberalism to ecofeminism,"A large number of women engage in political action, today and historically (West and Blumberg 1990). This fact however is not adequately accounted for in the liberal paradigm, according to feminist theorists who argue that paying attention to women's practices will produce more inclusive theories (Ferguson 1987, Jones 1990, Pateman 1988). Subsequently feminists theorists are constructing an alternative discourse analyzing from the perspective women's experiences offer. My study takes the self described political activism of women and uses its lessons to add to this developing discourse. Specifically, it enlists the feminist theory, ecofeminism to add insights to women's political activism. Ecofeminism has gained national and international recognition in the last twenty years as a progressive and critical social theory. Drawing from a diverse array of grass-roots movements across the globe it maintains close links between theory and political activism. Ecofeminism is multifaced. It sees sexism, racism, classism, speciesm, and naturalism as mutually reinforcing systems of oppression, a perspective which necessitates challenging all oppressions and hierarchal practices in general. For my study of ecofeminism and women's activism I conducted exploratory interviews with women working as grassroots community activists and women working through national political organizations--liberal feminist organizations and a ""pro-life"" organization. I analyzed the reasons why these women undertook political activism and the meaning of the experience itself. Common patterns emerged among these divergent activists. The most noteworthy pattern was the women were all motivated by a concern for others, a motivation that challenges the liberal tenet, self interest (as feminist theorists argue). Differing patterns also emerged among these groups of activists. I discuss both the common patterns of these women activists and their differing patterns in relation to ecofeminist theory. This study will add to the feminist literature that is beginning to change our concept of the political by incorporating a broader conception of who can and does participate, and for what reasons.",304207621,,Dissertations & Theses," Mack-Canty, ColleenMack-CantyColleenMack-Canty, Colleen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741060671 , 30929431 , 66569 , 9541927 , 9541927", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304207621?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies",," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," Political science , Womens studies", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+and+citizenship%3A+From+a+critique+of+liberalism+to+ecofeminism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mack-Canty%2C+Colleen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3496,Social discourses of the environment: The absence of consumption and consumerism,"This thesis examines several contexts for recognition within Canadian society of the biophysical limits to material growth and the related problem of overconsumption. Ecological and 'radical' forms of environmentalism have tended to embrace the tenets of the 'limits to growth,' and are therefore antithetical to the high levels of consumption and consumerism endemic to capitalist countries of the North. In this light, environmental discourses of Canadian news media, government, corporations, and the environmental government itself are examined. An elaboration of the 'limits to growth' and an environmental system of values provide a context for the thesis. Next, a case study of two recent years of environmental news within The Vancouver Sun tested for evidence of news media representation of the consumption problematic. Using key words 'environmental,' 'recycling,' and 'global warming,' and quantitative and qualitative analyses, the consumption problematic was determined to be virtually absent from the newspaper. This tendency is then related to the wider contexts in which news production takes place, especially the economic imperatives of commercial news media and some key professional and cultural dynamics influencing journalists coverage of environmental issues. The character of state environmental administration and 'green' corporations, and the reformist nature of the mainstream environmental movement are also outlined. Like the news media, these institutions generally perpetuate the ideological dominance of economic growth. By variously failing to embody ecological values and means of social change, they too inhibit wider recognition of the need to reduce material consumption. Last, the cultural context in which consumption proceeds space within capitalist countries is sketched. Consumer culture's tendency to privilege material measures of identity and status is analyzed as perhaps the ultimate obstacle to Canadian society's recognition of the ecological consequences of overconsumption.

It was a decade full of activity and heavily laden with events, as its closing days meant the point of inflection of a new stage in the mexican and oaxacan life. For such an aim, in a first approach, a general and global study about the Diocese has been done when analizing its different demonstrations and those levels in which the activities of its dwellers developed on: that is, we have essentially analized its economic, social and political structures which are influenced by its geographical setting. We have placed in such a social-economic setting a wide variety of main actors and characters who lived in Oaxaca at that time, such as the Bishop Antonio Bergosa, pragmatic man with enlightened and jansenistic education and behaviour, who will attemp to put into practice the enlightened project of the Crown, becoming eventually both the political and spiritual leader of Oaxaca. Secondly, we have placed the clergy, mainly the rural clergy, who will help him in his tasks, and thirdly, we have the parishioners, that is, the indian natives, representing an 88.4% of the total population of this Diocese. All this means a clash between a native cultural reality and a modern colonial project which Bergosa and his priests identify with and the indian natives rebel against. We put an end to such a study about the Bishopric in Oaxaca with a vision of the Diocese on the eve of the so-named Insurrection, when the echo of the Spanish war of Independence will create the necessary precedents which will shake the colonial american world and consequenthy this Diocese. And finally, we shall also deal slightly with the effect the insurgent movement had on this Diocese, which staggered the foundations and basis of the wealthy, prosperous and solid Oaxaca, as a final note of a decada and age.",304221638,,Dissertations & Theses," Lopez Ramirez, Mari A CarmenLopez RamirezA CarmenMariLopez Ramirez, Mari A Carmen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739205111 , 30113381 , 66569 , 9788436233407 , 8436233409 , C564835 , C564835", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995," 9788436233407 , 8436233409", Spanish, Spanish,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304221638?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0304 Biographies , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0304 Biographies , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0304 Biographies , 0330 Religious congregations",," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0304 Biographies , 0330 Religious congregations"," Latin American history , Religion , Biographies , Religious congregations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Bergosa, Antonio , Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Bishop+Bergosa+and+the+Diocese+of+Oaxaca+%281800-1810%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lopez+Ramirez%2C+Mari+A+Carmen&amp;isbn=9788436233407&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3498,"Textbook revision in the Soviet Union in the 1980s: ""Memory of a Nation""","This research essay consists of three major components. The first is a summary of the well documented chronology of historical revisionism during the years of ""glasnost"" in the Soviet Union (1985-1989). Emphasis is placed on movements within the historical and literary professions which culminated in government and Party reassessments of the Soviet past and the rehabilitations of various personalities who had for decades been cast in the role of traitors to socialism and the Soviet state. The second part of the paper examines the revision of Soviet high school textbooks which occurred primarily as a result of the above reassessment and rehabilitation. The thoroughly revisionist tenth grade history text published in 1989 (History of the U.S.S.R., (1900-1941)) is contrasted with texts which preceded it (published between the years 1957-1987). Two topics are examined in detail: the transition from NEP to mass collectivization (1928-1929), with emphasis placed on the treatment of the so-called 'Bukharin group', and Soviet involvement in the Spanish Civil War. The conclusion is reached that textbook revision was just as much--if not more--a result of the atmosphere of 'political correctness' which had grown up around glasnost and perestroika as it was the product of sincere research and interpretation by the historical community of previously unavailable source materials. The final portion of the research essay is an examination of the portions of the ninth and tenth grade global studies syllabus of New York State that relate to the two topics examined above, and an evaluation of the treatment of these events in textbooks used in New York State social studies classrooms (texts with similar publication dates to their Soviet couterparts). Accompanying this discussion is the author's suggestions as to how both the syllabus and the texts could be best revised to reflect the Soviet revisionism which has given a new perspective to much of Soviet history.",304221705,,Dissertations & Theses," Katz, Philip J.KatzJ.PhilipKatz, Philip J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742652511 , 31215081 , 66569 , 9520112 , 9520112", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304221705?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0520 Education history"," 0335 European history , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0520 Education history"," 0335 European history , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0520 Education history",," 0335 European history , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching , 0520 Education history"," European history , Curricula , Teaching , Education history"," Social sciences , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Textbook+revision+in+the+Soviet+Union+in+the+1980s%3A+%22Memory+of+a+Nation%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Katz%2C+Philip+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3499,Economic implications of an alternative marketing system for yellow maize on the South African animal feed industry,"Structural changes are taking place in South African agriculture. Agronomical production shows a decline in production, while animal production shows a positive growth rate. Future growth for the demand of agricultural products for human consumption will be considerably higher for animal products than for grain products. Stockfeed requirements are expected to increase by 57,8% to at least 8,76 million tons for the year 2000. A detailed analysis was done on the production, consumption and price trends of the main protein stockfeed sources (industries supplying them). The marketing thereof were analysed, also taking into account the regional supply and demand of the protein sources for stockfeed. This was done in thirteen regions, identifying regional balances, transport costs and the flow of raw materials. The gross margins of the industries supplying the protein raw materials were analysed as well as the relative profitability. Important policy inconsistencies were identified, of which most can be directly linked to the single channel marketing systems of the products. Since maize is the single most important source of raw material to the stockfeed industry, while the maize marketing system also acts as an ""umbrella"" for the other industries, detailed recommendations were formulated to deregulate the marketing system. Deregulation is necessary to allow supply and demand factors to interact, especially on a regional basis. The Maize Board should be restructured to render a limited service, while market participants should be allowed to trade freely and performing the necessary marketing functions themselves. The domestic maize price should be linked to international market forces. A sectoral linear programming model was used to evaluate the economic implications of the deregulated yellow maize marketing system on the SA animal feed industry. The result showed clearly that the current maize marketing system ""tax"" the livestock industry to the benefit of maize producers and white maize users. The social cost of this policy is significantly and the impact on the livestock industry is severe. The result clearly indicates that a movement to a freer marketing system, with regional prices and allowing imports--is the policy where social costs will be minimized.",304228241,,Dissertations & Theses," Willemse, Barend JohannesWillemseJohannesBarendWillemse, Barend Johannes", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742073071 , 30630071 , 66569 , 0576256 , 0576256", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304228241?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0338 Marketing"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0338 Marketing"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0338 Marketing",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0338 Marketing"," Agricultural economics , Marketing"," Social sciences , maize",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Economic+implications+of+an+alternative+marketing+system+for+yellow+maize+on+the+South+African+animal+feed+industry&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Willemse%2C+Barend+Johannes&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3500,"The survival of privilege: The strategies of political resilience of oligarchies in the Philippines, 1946-1992. (The case of three provinces: Bulacan, Negros Occidental and Bukidnon)","This study charts the persistence of oligarchic rule in the Philippines, using the provinces of Bulacan, Negros Occidental and Bukidnon as case studies, through the twentieth century, focusing primarily on the post-war period from 1946 to 1992. Contrary to interpretations of Philippine policies that highlight discontinuities in politcal rulership, this work suggests some fundamental continuities in the composition of the Philippine State's family-based oligarchies, their strategies of rulership, and organisation of ideological, political, economic and military power. This study highlights six main strategies which lead to the persistence of oligarchic rule: (1) the establishment and maintenance of kinship network, especially through intermarraige, and non-kinship ties between and among oligarchic families; (2) diversification into non-agricultural economic interests, e.g. real estate, logging, mining and other industrial enterprises, primarily by establishing family-owned banks, cornering loans and subsidies from government banks and other State institutions and creating tie-ups with foreign and other local capitalists; (3) the control of political parties and State patronage machinery by using their personal wealth and political patronage to non-rival oligarchs, business power brokers and political ward leaders to secure votes, appointments to public office, business franchises and protection and other political favours; (4) the use of political power to obstruct progressive legislation, particularly on land reform and taxation; (5) the exploitation of political symbols or issues (e.g. nationalism, land reform), movements (peasants, cooperatives, non-government organisations and private foundations), and foreign aid from international development agencies for their political objectives; and (6) the astute management of political violence, more conspicuous and vulgar in the case of oligarchs who lack substantial connections to economic capital. As shown in the provincial case studies, the substitution of land-based personal wealth with State patronage machinery as source of political funding in the post-war period moderately altered the social origins and composition of political elites without changing the fundamental oligarchic characteristics of the political system.

The outstanding feature of this journal is its fusion of avant-garde esthetics and indigenismo, the cultural movement that redefined national identity in Peru during the 1920's. I thus analyze the emergence of the journal as the expression of an intellectual project which aimed at redefining Latin American esthetics by combining regional and cosmopolitan elements in their practice of indigenismo vanguardista. However, the project went far beyond the artistic and literary milieu to enter an ideological discussion that focused on the struggle for the preeminent role that the Andean indigenous heritage was to have in the national conscience. This was viewed as one of the major ""revolutions"" that the spirit of vanguardism was to contribute to the Peruvian cultural and ideological sphere. Therefore, my study relates the Boletin Titikaka to the contemporary national debate on indigenismo as part of a general discussion on nationalism and cultural identity within the whole of Latin America. By contextualizing the emergence of the Boletin Titikaka within the major changes in Peruvian society that took place around the 1920's, this study also emphasizes this journal's activities as a vehicle for the expression of the emergent mestizo middle class, the group which promoted indigenismo. This social group was also responsible for the development of a new type of intellectual who was outside the power structure, opposed the status quo and brought claims that attempted to democratize and decentralize the cultual field. Moreover, this Peruvian intelligentsia was connected to its peers throughout Latin America, and by means of intellectual exchange and a shared Americanist ideology, their activities resulted in a general quest for originality and cultural independence. Therefore, my work provides a study of the vital role journals like the Boletin Titikaka played both in the integration of the Latin American cultural and ideological milieus and in the diffusion of transnational artistic and literary productions such as the avant-garde and regional cultural movements such as indigenismo.",304234665,,Dissertations & Theses," Vich, Cynthia MariaVichMariaCynthiaVich, Cynthia Maria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742131201 , 30652131 , 66569 , 9535684 , 9535684", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, Spanish, Spanish,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304234665?accountid=14496, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature,, 0312 Latin American literature, Latin American literature," Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Avant-garde+esthetics+and+indigenismo+in+%22Boletin+Titikaka%22+%28Puno%2C+Peru%2C+1926--1930%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vich%2C+Cynthia+Maria&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3502,The creation of the image of the Indian in 19th-century Peru: The paintings of Francisco Laso (1823-1869),"This dissertation studies the first important appearance of the theme of the Indian in modern Peruvian painting, in the works of Francisco Laso (1823-1869). The emergence of this subject matter is examined as part of a wider process of reorganization of social and ethnic identities in post-independence Peru. Inscribed within a dualistic image of the nation, an idealized and abstract ""Indian"" becomes the cornerstone of Creole nationalist ideology. This manner of representing the nation defines the discourse of modern Indigenism as I define it, and although I do not present Laso himself as an early precursor of this 20th century movement, I argue that his life and work can serve as the basis for a case study in the conditions of the possibility of Indigenist discourse. By examining Indigenism as a discourse, I also analyze its specific rhetorical strategies, in particular that of approximation and simultaneous distancing to a Creole-created ""Andean world."" My discussion centers mainly on only a few works by Laso (Inhabitant of the Cordilleras, Portrait of Gonzalo Pizarro, The Three Races, and the Pascana series), although a number of other works by the artist are also discussed. I analyze these paintings in the context of contemporary discussions on the Indian population in Peru, but also with regard to the international circuits in which cosmopolitan intellectuals like Laso are increasingly situated. I explain the emergence of the modern image of the Indian as a consequence of both the racial prejudices structuring Peruvian society and the discourse of authenticity defining ethno-linguistic nationalisms.",304247621,,Dissertations & Theses," Majluf, NataliaMajlufNataliaMajluf, Natalia", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742790001 , 30657881 , 66569 , 9617294 , 9617294", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304247621?accountid=14496, 0377 Art History, 0377 Art History, 0377 Art History,, 0377 Art History, Art History," Communication and the arts , Laso, Francisco , nineteenth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+creation+of+the+image+of+the+Indian+in+19th-century+Peru%3A+The+paintings+of+Francisco+Laso+%281823-1869%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Majluf%2C+Natalia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3503,"A history of the ""International Encyclopedia of Unified Science""","This dissertation examines the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, founded and edited by Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap, and Charles Morris in 1937.

My hypothesis is that the emergent intellectuals or new intellectual formations--incipient and fragmented though they may be in these societies--suggest a fundamental restructuring of world thought which is contributing to the lifting of a ""hegemonic hold"" (Goonatilake) as a process towards authentic emancipation and a new social order. Although there is considerable evidence of Western cultural hegemony in various domains of these societies, I examine these emergent intellectuals as forums of resistance in three different discourses: educational institutions, especially universities in post-colonial societies; narrative art, with an emphasis on fiction writing; and political praxis, drawn from contemporary post-colonial movements. Each of the three discourses represents aspects of different tendencies in the global process towards the quest for ""authentic liberation"". To further nuance and delineate these tendencies, I analyze in greater depth the work of three emergent intellectuals reflective of dominant alternative processes corresponding to each of the three discourses selected: first, the work of Susantha Goonatilake, a Sri Lankan engineer and sociologist; secondly, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, a Kenyan writer and former lecturer of English literature; and thirdly, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of Uganda and revolutionary leader of a national political movement in the post-independence period. As a global intellectual study, this work has a broad canvas. The conceptual notions and processes of analysis suggested in the work of Raymond Williams and Antonio Gramsci are used to circumscribe the boundaries of the broad framework. Imperialism resulted in an abrupt cutting off of cultural processes that have led to massive distortions, mutations, and ""aborted discoveries"" within post-colonial societies. I am asserting as active process a new consciousness that is emerging in contemporary post-colonial societies and I tell that story, as much as possible, from the perspective of the liberating process.",304258599,,Dissertations & Theses," Boyd, Rosalind ElizabethBoydElizabethRosalindBoyd, Rosalind Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742792981 , 31434091 , 66569 , 9780612050594 , 0612050599 , NN05059 , NN05059", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995," 9780612050594 , 0612050599", English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304258599?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Goonatilake, Susantha , Kenya , Ngugi wa Thiong'o , Sri Lanka , Susantha Goonatilake , Uganda , Yoweri Kaguta Museveni",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emergent+intellectual+challenges+to+Western+cultural+hegemony+in+postcolonial+societies&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boyd%2C+Rosalind+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780612050594&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3505,The time and place of sport,"The aim of these studies from the year 1987 onwards was, by means of conceptual and material analyses, to de- and reconstruct: (a) sport as popular culture, as an expression of the sensuality and spontaneity of the common people, (b) new cultural conditions for sports and corporeality at the threshold of modernity/postmodernity, (c) the specific forms of perception (e.g. the ""record"", the ""landscape"") and mentality in physical activity along with the new conceptuality of cultural and microhistory; and finally to develop (d) some fresh models and possibilities for a new body-cultural approach in sport research and physical education. The purpose in the final instance was not to generate a new ""grand theory"" of sports, but, in accordance with the present ethnography, to deepen and further differentiate the local, minute understanding of the phenomenas in physical activity. The basic approach in these articles was to confront theoretical concepts and phenomenological observation, or to put it in a more philosophical way, ""the universal"" and ""the specific"", even ""the peculiar"", and to dwell deeper into this specificity--various experiences of time and space, an old, censored (?) nude picture, the old feast tradition of the local fire brigade or a certain natural landscape, a mountain--and to specify here, by means of proper concepts, something common and generalizable on a wider scale. Section I deals with the historical background of sport in Finland in the late 19th century, locating the accurate points and minor events where the new, sporting dynamics breaks through the shell of the old, rural mentality and atmosphere. The second section discusses some major cultural sociologists (Th. W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Norbert Elias, and Henning Eichberg) of the locality and temporality in everyday life, corporeality and sensuality. In section III, an attempt is made to sketch and estimate some new trends in the physical culture of the late 1980's in Finland, with new games, exercises, bodily movements and expressions. In the last section I try to make some more synthetic conclusions, and apply the method of the study to some local historical and natural examples.

This study seeks to understand why this is so, by presenting a profile of the Malays. The thesis is that the Malays have been historically, culturally, and religiously conditioned to be resistant to Christian overtures. This is defended through three prongs: historical investigation, religio-cultural analysis, and an empirical study of modern Malay university students in the United States. The first prong, that of the historical investigation, demonstrates that the successive colonization of Malaya by Western nations that identified themselves as Christian, coupled with the Christian missions' close association with the colonial administrations, their implication in policies seen by the Malays as detrimental to the Malays, and their neglect of the Malay people have led to a Malay antagonism against and fierce resistance to Christianity. The second prong, the religio-cultural study, analyses the relationship between Malay ethnic identity and normative Islam. A strong attachment to Islam coalesces with an exclusivistic Malay ethnic identity to make the Malays see Christianity as foreign to who they are as a people. The fact that Malays get their personal identity from the group militates against individual Malays breaking the social and religious barrier to considering Christianity as a viable option. The third prong of the study entails the findings of interviews of Malay university students in the United States. The information adds to the preceding by giving a firsthand account of what Malays believe about Islam and how they practice it. It also shows their understanding of Islam's relation to the state, and their view of their Malay identity in relation to Islam and other religions, especially Christianity. The interviews also test whether Malay international students display the openness to religious innovation that is typical of many internationals, and whether their exposure to American culture over time causes them to change their views on Christianity. We discover that the Malays in the United States retreat into a Malay ethnic enclave mentality that prohibits free inquiry and causes them to maintain their allegiance to Islam. In some cases, moreover, the relative lack of external, societal pressure to conform to Islam leads them to internalize their faith, and thus become more personally committed to Islam. The study concludes by noting that the rapidly changing Malay society is shattering traditional lifestyles and strong kinship ties, potentially weakening the societal barriers to receptivity to Christianity. In addition, we conclude that Malays overall have never been the object of concerted and thoughtful evangelization efforts, and that Malays do respond favorably to Christian gestures of kindness. Finally, a massive prayer movement is mobilizing to effect the evangelization of Malays.

This was achieved by examining how a group of potato farmers formed an interest group and challenged the Canadian Government in an effort to defend its interests, and how the latter countered that challenge in a manner that ensured that it retain its position of domination and control. Understanding the nature of that challenge required an examination of the process or “dynamics” of decision making as the two parties interacted with each other, seeking to resolve the situation. The study took place in Prince Edward Island over the course of three years (1990–1993). The crisis arose as a result of a potato virus (PVYn), which was found in the seed potato system. Although it causes no harm to potatoes or humans, it is lethal to the tobacco plant. The potential threat that PVYn posed to the US tobacco industry led the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ban the importation of Island seed potatoes and the Canadian Government to subsequently extend the ban to mainland Canada, thus denying the Island's seed potato growers access to their two major markets. As a result, this crucial component of PEI's economy, which represents in excess of $100 million annually, remained at a virtual standstill for over two years. In examining the process by which a resolution was sought, the study assumed a Pluralist position—that power is fragmented or dispersed throughout all strata of society, and that it can arise whenever and wherever people act in concert. A combination of two theories of collective action, New Social Movement and Resource Mobilization, were used to examine the process of mobilization. The methodology incorporated a combination of media releases, correspondence, minutes of the Industry and PVYn Action Committees, official and unofficial documentation, and approximately seventy-five interviews. The study revealed that both the farmers and the Government used primarily traditional methods to defend their interests. The farmers were generally unsuccessful throughout much of the three-year. period of the PVYn situation, because they were unaccustomed to challenging the Government. For the most part, they used strategies that were generally successful in the 1960s and 1970s. Not only does successful challenging the Government today require much greater skill, but challengers must also think and act in what Weber labeled “formal-rational” terms. Also revealed was a phenomenon which may well become more common in economic crisis situations, which is the presence of foreign governments in the role of third parties. Since Canada is closely connected to other countries through various international economic agreements, any resolutions of Canadian economic problems must increasingly require the cooperation or consent of foreign governments. This may well mean that problem solving will increasingly involve multi-partite power arrangements.",304295520,,Dissertations & Theses," Fullerton, Robin CatherineFullertonCatherineRobinFullerton, Robin Catherine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730823351 , 30121811 , 66569 , 9780612463035 , 0612463036 , NQ46303 , NQ46303", Dissertation/Thesis, 1995," 9780612463035 , 0612463036", English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304295520?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Interest group , Mobilization , Potato farmers , Power , Prince Edward Island",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Potato+farmers+in+exile%3A++Power%2C+state%2C+and+the+mobilization+of+an+interest+group&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fullerton%2C+Robin+Catherine&amp;isbn=9780612463035&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3508,The underlying causes of some problematic responses to curriculum evaluation reports within the ethnographic tradition,"This thesis follows the natural history of the research which gave rise to it. Working as an evaluator on a Social and Environmental Studies curriculum development project in the Republic of Ireland the author was surprised by some of the reactions to his evaluation reports. After consideration he came to the conclusion that these products of his evaluation had of themselves some sort of socio-political role. Moving to Northern Ireland he came into contact with a number of other evaluators, some of international repute, who convinced him that his experiences were not unique but were shared by other evaluators. He was helped to formulate and flesh out an Aggregate Pathology Model of reactions to evaluation products. This model represented a cumulative but not necessarily complete schema of possible negative reactions to evaluation products and included; cooption and collusion between the evaluation and the project, restrictive renegotiation of the evaluator's contract, rhetorical acceptance of the product divorced from political action, rejection of the evaluator or his product, distancing from the evaluation, a counter denunciation in which dossiers of evidence are produced to discredit the evaluation, the use of human sensitivity as an instrument of human control over the evaluation, and a `rival product' developed as an internal counter-thrust to the independent evaluation. Visiting this model with members of the evaluation community the author received qualified approval of its contents as a valid and useful map of many of their own evaluative experiences. In endeavouring to ascertain what might be the cause of the pathological reactions to evaluative products Concomitant Variation Method was used to compare contrasting between-case evaluation outcomes. This enabled the establishment of constants and independent and dependent variables, in evaluation cases where typicality had been established. As a result of its application to evaluation cases three explanations are advanced as causes of pathological reactions to evaluation products. These are (1) that the products are not `practical' in the sense identified by Schwab (2) that the pathology represents reactions to evaluation perceived as a degradation exercise (3) that evaluation products appear at nodes or decisive cusps in project activity where sensitivity is heightened. These explanations are offered as decisive in a final case study of a curriculum evaluation this time conducted in the political and social sensitivities of Northern Ireland. The thesis ends with a methodological appendix and a summary of the conclusions. A review of the literature covers the history of the evaluation problem of the thesis from its beginnings as a substantive critique of the testing movement and as a partial expansion from curriculum development, to the use of ethnography and other metaphors from the sciences and arts in the evaluation of curricula. The problem itself, aspects of which are covered in the literature, is next dealt with and some pertinent explanatory concepts from the social sciences are given. Finally, some published material concerning the principal evaluation cases studied in the thesis are given.",1808748981,,Dissertations & Theses," O'Connor, Sean B.O'ConnorB.SeanO'Connor, Sean B.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4137185031 , 106872442 , 101309 , U003938 , U003938", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1808748981?accountid=14496, 0727 Curriculum development, 0727 Curriculum development, 0727 Curriculum development, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0727 Curriculum development, Curriculum development," (UMI)AAIU003938 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+underlying+causes+of+some+problematic+responses+to+curriculum+evaluation+reports+within+the+ethnographic+tradition&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Connor%2C+Sean+B.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3509,"The development of ghanaian pentecostalism: a study in the appropriation of the christian gospel in twentieth century ghana setting with special reference to the christ apostolic church, the church of pentecost, and the international central gospel church","The study investigates the origins and development of Pentecostalism in Ghana with special reference to the Christ Apostolic Church, the Church of Pentecost, and the International Central Gospel Church. The theological section explores the continuity and discontinuity between the movement's conception of salvation and the primal concept of salvation. Part A looks at the Akan cosmology, the Akan concept of salvation, and the political, economic and social history of the Gold Coast/Ghana. It also examines some twentieth century Christian renewal movements in Ghana. Part B probes into the historical development of Ghanaian Pentecostalism and the Life and Faith of the movement, using the Christ Apostolic Church, the Church of Pentecost, and the International Central Gospel Church as case studies. Part C examines the Ghanaian Pentecostal soteriology using the Prayer Camps as a case study. The author concludes that the search of the Pentecostals for salvation or abundant life, manifests a continuity with the Akan traditional religious aspirations: a search for Salvation in which health, prosperity, dignity, fertility, security, vitality, and equilibrium within the cosmos are dominant. It also manifests a radical discontinuity in its hostile stand against all traditional forms of supernatural succour. Aspect of the discontinuity between the two religious expressions is Pentecostalism's concern for the paradise beyond. A related interest in this study is the investigation of the influence of socioeconomic factors on the eschatological presuppositions and the evangelistic ethos of the Pentecostal churches. The evidence from the Ghanaian context has led us to the conclusion that the materials presented in this study do not corroborate the thesis that the expectation of the parousia declines in the older Pentecostal denominations as their economic circumstances improve. Our findings indicate that though the neopentecostals believe in the parousia, this has not featured prominently in their kerygma. This, we propose, is due to their avowed concern to address the existential issues facing Ghanaians. The evidence indicates that the Prosperity or Abundant Life Gospel as espoused by the neo-pentecostals, is an attempt to appropriate the biblical message of salvation to suit the contemporary socio-economic and religious experience of Ghanaians.",1827469193,,Dissertations & Theses," Larbi, Emmanuel Kingsley KwabenaLarbiKingsley KwabenaEmmanuelLarbi, Emmanuel Kingsley Kwabena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209440521 , 103022622 , 101309 , 10174299 , 10174299 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9987", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827469193?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9987 , (UMI)AAI10174299 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+development+of+ghanaian+pentecostalism%3A+a+study+in+the+appropriation+of+the+christian+gospel+in+twentieth+century+ghana+setting+with+special+reference+to+the+christ+apostolic+church%2C+the+church+of+pentecost%2C+and+the+international+central+gospel+church&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Larbi%2C+Emmanuel+Kingsley+Kwabena&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3510,The construction of Latin identities and salsa music clubs in London: An ethnographic study,"This thesis is based on ethnographic research carried out between October 1993 and September 1994 and examines the construction and communication of Latin cultural identities across a selection of salsa music clubs in London. Through an engagement with contemporary theories of globalisation, 'power-geometry' and cultural identity the thesis argues for the need to understand music related practices in salsa clubs in relation to wider social, economic and political processes occurring from without the clubs, but which have an impact in the construction and communication of 'Latin' identities at these sites. In this sense, this thesis proposes three analytical distinct but interrelated levels of analysis as a way of studying cultural identities and salsa clubs in London; that of nation and migration, the identity of places and the performing body. In addressing the issue of nation and migration this thesis considers how Britain's immigration regulations affect the movement of Latin Americans across London, having an impact on the visible presence of Latin American cultural practices across London. This is then related to the geographical location of 'Latin' clubs which seek to attract both Latin Americans and non-Latin people. In discussing the identity of places this thesis provides specific details about salsa clubs in London and describes the practices of club owners, promoters and disc jockeys in constructing the identity of the clubs so as to communicate a 'Latin' identity. The thesis also examines how places with different but particular 'Latin' identities are constituted out of participants' movements across salsa clubs in London. The construction and communication of Latin identities is further developed by considering the relationship between body and music as performed by dancers and musicians. This approach to the study of 'Latin' cultural identities and salsa clubs in London has implications for theoretical discussions about the relationship between cultural identities and places: It suggests that the micro movements of the dancing body in a particular event needs to be related to macro attempts to regulate the movement of bodies at an international level. This, in turn, should be considered in relation to broader spatial relationships across the city of London whereby particular places have been given a 'Latin' identity. This thesis elaborates on this discussion and suggests the need for further exploration and explanation of ongoing relations of power between these three overlapping levels of analysis which are at play in the construction and communication of 'Latin' cultural identities in London.",301470221,,Dissertations & Theses," Roman-Velazquez, PatriaRoman-VelazquezPatriaRoman-Velazquez, Patria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757412631 , 44594121 , 101309 , U077410 , U077410", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301470221?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Music"," (UMI)AAIU077410 , Social sciences , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+construction+of+Latin+identities+and+salsa+music+clubs+in+London%3A+An+ethnographic+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roman-Velazquez%2C+Patria&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3511,Ezekiel and the ethics of exile,"Much recent work on the ethics of the Hebrew Bible addresses the theological task of using the Bible as a moral resource for today. By contrast, this thesis examines the moral concerns of the book of Ezekiel as part of a more historical or sociological task: to describes the ethical ideals and practice of the ancient communities which produced the Bible. Ezekiel addressed a community which Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Judah to Babylonia in 597 BC, and as exiles they belonged to two different moral worlds - different realms of moral possibility. The exiles originally came from Judah's ruling elite, and, before their deportation, would have participated in decisions affecting major communal institutions and thus the lives of many others. As Ezekiel predicts the destruction of Jerusalem, the sins he condemns belong largely to the world of these institutions, and his special concerns are international politics and the correct maintenance of the state cult. However, as deportees to Babylonia the exiles experienced a severe loss of status and their communal identity was threatened. Elements in Ezekiel's ethics can be seen as mechanisms for survival, providing significant impetus for social cohesion and the maintenance of a distinctively Jewish community. The rituals of the destroyed temple become the centrepiece of an ethical system which looks back to the homeland for its symbolic coherence. As communal decisions become impossible an increasing ""domestication"" of sin and virtue moves the focus of ethical interest from the institutions of state to the individual and the family. Furthermore, the book displays a movement from responsibility for judgement to passivity in the face of restoration that reflects the actual social circumstances of the exiles, who have moved from the world of power and influence in Jerusalem to the far more limited moral world of exile in Babylonia.",301489884,,Dissertations & Theses," Mein, AndrewMeinAndrewMein, Andrew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757429991 , 44598081 , 101309 , U093026 , U093026", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301489884?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0469 Theology, Theology," (UMI)AAIU093026 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ezekiel+and+the+ethics+of+exile&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mein%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3512,"Sea harvesters, traders and corporations: Local and global dynamics in the world seaweed-carrageenan economy","By focussing on the development of a global seaweed-carrageenan economy, this dissertation aims at presenting world-system dynamics in terms of an approach mixing micro- and macro-units of analysis. The anthropological subjects presented in this text are Muslim Filipinos cultivating seaweed in southern Palawan; traders from those communities who transport the commodity to upper knots of commercial mediation; middlemen in Puerto Princesa (the provincial capital); Philippine corporations exporting or processing seaweed, and finally ""core"" multinationals. All these subjects are presented as agents who can be accounted for only in terms of interrelated processes. As the product of transformations entailing movements and exchanges crossing space a commodity links people following different value systems and embedded in different socio-economic structures. By tracing the activities of different individuals operating at various levels in the world seaweed economy, I hope to show how the modern world system is articulated not only in terms of mechanical connections between abstract structures, but also in terms of the structure-shaping practices of social actors who are pursuing different interests in conditions of inequality. But, I would also like to show how these practices are informed equally by material and cultural/ideological concerns, at each point of the articulation. The tenet that material and symbolic capitals have mutual influence in the reproduction of social life is not new; but it has often been elaborated with reference to isolated microcosms (e.g. Bourdieu).

It discussed the reform project ""The Mission of the Ecuadorean University for the XXI Century""; the modernization movement in Latin America; and the government regulation models from which higher education systems derive. Models of the current and proposed higher education systems were developed and analyzed based on the constructs of the State Control and State Supervising Models. The study presented that the current model of Ecuadorean higher education was neither compatible with the characteristics of the State Supervising Model nor enabled the adoption of innovations. The study discussed that the State Control Model from which the Ecuadorean higher education system derived since colonial times, preserved the poor external efficiency of higher education given the high dropout rates, low research-teaching ratios, few new grants per year, little investment in library and scientific equipment, lack of scholarships, and high costs per government subsidized degrees (compared to Ecuadorean economic standards). The study also analyzed the centralized nature of the operating governance model as it antagonized the interaction between government agencies, international entities, professional organizations, and the private sector. The lack of linkage with other governmental and non governmental agencies emphasized the strong monopoly of power that the Ecuadorean National Congress had over the higher education system. The new model of Ecuadorean higher education governance developed in this study focused on decentralization and its potential to enable the adoption of innovations. The impact of the new model on the external efficiency of higher education and its relationship with national economic growth was predicted by comparing and correlating the performance of higher education in Ecuador to Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador and the United States of America. The new model was compatible with the constructs of the State Supervising Model and Theory of Innovations by Hage and Aiken. The new model sought to alleviate the current higher education crisis by considering the recommendations of the project ""The Mission of the Ecuadorean University for the XXI Century"". The statistical comparison of institutions in Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador and United States of America under State Supervising and State Control models, as measured by university dropout rates, student-teacher ratios, research-teaching ratios, new grants per year, and cost per degrees, helped to evaluate the possible impact of the new Ecuadorean model on the external efficiency of Ecuadorean higher education. The statistical analysis showed which external efficiency descriptors would and would not change once the Ecuadorean higher education institutions operate under a decentralized model. Correlating the external efficiency of higher education institutions in Ecuador, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and the United States, to their Gross National Products indicated which higher education external efficiency descriptors had a significant relationship with the country's economic performance. This provided a criteria about which external efficiency descriptors need to be monitored or disregarded in order to assess economic growth.",304245765,,Dissertations & Theses," Chacon Burbano, Maria de LourdesChacon Burbanode LourdesMariaChacon Burbano, Maria de Lourdes", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739309271 , 32044701 , 66569 , 9780591074093 , 0591074095 , 9701136 , 9701136", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591074093 , 0591074095", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304245765?accountid=14496," 0745 Higher education , 0514 School administration"," 0745 Higher education , 0514 School administration"," 0745 Higher education , 0514 School administration",," 0745 Higher education , 0514 School administration"," Higher education , School administration", Education,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+new+model+of+Ecuadorean+higher+education%3A+Its+impact+on+external+efficiency%2C+innovations%2C+and+economic+growth&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chacon+Burbano%2C+Maria+de+Lourdes&amp;isbn=9780591074093&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3514,"AIDS, activism and the social imagination in Brazil","This dissertation examines how AIDS-related, non-governmental organizations (AIDS/NGOs) have attempted to mobilize Brazilian society in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Through focusing on the prevention/education programs and political action strategies of two such groups--Grupo Pela VIDDA in Rio de Janeiro and GAPA/RS in Porto Alegre--I explore the operation of a global AIDS industry in local settings and the ways in which AIDS activism has affected popular conceptions of HIV/AIDS and behavior at individual and collective levels. The project is based upon qualitative and quantitative data obtained from twenty-six months of fieldwork in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, including participant observation in the two NGOs, archival research, and a year long study of a low income community in Porto Alegre. The thesis employs a multi-leveled analytical framework to investigate the critical social and cultural spaces that shape and are shaped by Brazilian AIDS activism, including the popular media, the world of AIDS/NGOs, and local practices and attitudes related to HIV/AIDS. The discussion begins by considering ten years of Brazilian media narratives and argues that despite increasing coverage and clarification of the epidemiological realities of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil, AIDS continues to be viewed primarily as a problem of a gendered ""other."" Building on this symbolic and discursive analysis, the dissertation's next two chapters provide a historical overview of how Brazilian AIDS activism came to be concentrated within AIDS/NGOs and suggests that the resulting institutionalization and professionalization of these groups, while enabling many effective programs, nonetheless has contributed to their relative isolation from other Brazilian political actors and social movements. The second half of the thesis focuses on case studies of AIDS prevention activities in a low income neighborhood and at a NGO based work group of travesti sex professionals. These experiences indicate that although the success of AIDS-related initiatives is largely dependent on people's willingness to integrate AIDS issues into broader collective concerns and to challenge often deeply ingrained constructions of the erotic that privilege (male) sexual pleasure and transgression over questions of gender/sexual inequality, many Brazilians continue to see AIDS prevention as at best a nuisance to be endured rather than as a pressing political question. In conclusion, I present an emerging wave of cultural production and activism centered on sexuality and race as one possible path through which Brazilian AIDS activism might revitalize itself and partially break the organizational stagnation and public complacency produced by more than ten years of living the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brasil.",304245934,,Dissertations & Theses," Klein, Charles HowardKleinHowardCharlesKlein, Charles Howard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739541951 , 19483041 , 66569 , 0591195208 , 9780591195200 , 9712004 , 9712004", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 0591195208 , 9780591195200", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304245934?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare"," Cultural anthropology , Public health , Latin American history , Political science , Welfare"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , immune deficiency",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=AIDS%2C+activism+and+the+social+imagination+in+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klein%2C+Charles+Howard&amp;isbn=0591195208&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3515,"Political economy of institutions and policy change: The case of stabilization policy of 1979, Korea","During the second oil crisis of the late 1970s, a dramatic policy reversal occurred in Korea. The character and functioning of this policy shift from ""growth by any means"" to ""stabilization"" can only be understood if they are seen collectively as instruments for coping with a political crisis as well as an economic contradiction, even though this change was partly a response to an unfavorable exogenous event like the second oil shock and previous policy failures. The point of this study is to explain the causes, processes and consequences of this policy change with the aid of a comprehensive institutionalist perspective that links economic policy and the policy-making process to the dynamics between the structural constraints implicit in socio-economic organization and the empowerment of agents involved in the struggle for change. Along this line, our analysis also incorporates careful consideration of the forces or actors at various levels, mainly as organized form, formally and conventionally, that shape these policy change processes and outcomes. First, it calls attention to power relationships in the structure and practice of the export-oriented industrialization policy of 18 years that had been led by the coalition of an authoritarian regime and large industrialists (chaebols). It, further, focuses on an underlying socio-economic structure and prodemocracy movement that not only opposed their country's authoritarian politics but was also increasingly able to resist the state's economic policy. In addition, it also examines intellectual innovations which the country's policy community of neo-liberal bureaucrats and technocrats helped produce, move into the power structure, and finally become reality in 1979 as the Comprehensive Stabilization Program. These innovations have persisted well into the 1980s, beyond the historical moment. Our observation shows that if social conditions had a crucial influence on the rate of policy transformation, so too did the elite ""sponsorship"" at critical junctures. This study emphasizes that the Korean state became socialized not only through structural change within the society and the international system, but also through intersubjective understanding, shared expectation and on-the-job learning, while focusing especially on how political imperatives had a definite impact on the processes and outcome. It says that the most important consequence of this policy change is the erosion of etatism of the Korean state in governing the economy.",304252068,,Dissertations & Theses," Chang, Kay SoonChangSoonKayChang, Kay Soon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739531951 , 19486791 , 66569 , 9780591194586 , 0591194589 , 9711936 , 9711936", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591194586 , 0591194589", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304252068?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0332 History"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0332 History"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0332 History",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0332 History"," Political science , International law , International relations , History", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+economy+of+institutions+and+policy+change%3A+The+case+of+stabilization+policy+of+1979%2C+Korea&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chang%2C+Kay+Soon&amp;isbn=9780591194586&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3516,"Violent democratization and the feeble state: Political violence, breakdown and recomposition in Peru, 1980-1995","This is a study of the expansion of political violence in Peru during the 1980s and early 1990s, after Peru made a successful transition from military to civilian, constitutional rule in 1980. This dissertation attempts to explain how a broad, inclusive party system which included a strong partisan left could coexist with a powerful and pervasive violent left, led by Sendero Luminoso ('Shining Path'). It also explains why Peru experienced a rupture in democratic rule on April 5, 1992, the so-called autogolpe (or 'self-coup') instigated by President Alberto Fujimori. It also seeks to understand the factors which enabled the post-coup civil-military regime to consolidate its power. The theoretical framework presented is a state-oriented framework, which examines the interaction of economic, political, social and international factors with state capacity along four dimensions. The argument is that both the 'violent democratization' and autogolpe phenomena can be explained in terms of factors relating to the incapacity of the Peruvian state during the 1980s. State weakness, I argue, contributed to a political and economic opportunity structure (PEOS) which was favorable to the expansion of political violence at precisely the moment at which Peru was moving toward a more inclusive, participatory regime. State weaknesses also generated a political crisis which led to a backlash against traditional parties, and this antiparty backlash in turn paved the way for political independents, notably Alberto Fujimori, to rise to power and subsequently to disband the constitutional regime inaugurated in 1980 in favor of a highly centralized civilian regime with broadly expanded presidential powers and strong military backing, a regime which challenges conventional notions of democracy and authoritarianism and contains elements of both. Utilizing various methods, primarily interviewing, statistical analysis presented in cartographic (map) form, archival research and secondary source research, the analysis reveals political and economic transformations at both the national and regional (departmental) levels of analysis which led to the expansion of violence in conjunction with the expansion of democratic participation, the breakdown of a democratic regime, and the consolidation of the new civil-military regime in the context of a radically restructured state along neoliberal lines. Economic variables are by themselves found to be inaccurate predictors of levels of violence across regions of a society. Meanwhile, the relative presence or absence of political authority, whether state authority or private authority is found to be a major determinant of levels of conflict across regions of a democratizing country. Structures of authority thwart the expansion of political violence, while the relative absence of those structures of authority can encourage the expansion of violence, especially in relatively affluent regions. The analysis also reveals that civil society can also be a major, albeit unwitting contributor to political violence in that sectors of society can be exploited by a guerrilla movement in pursuit of power, contributing to higher levels of violence. Finally, this dissertation demonstrates how the restructuring of the state can contribute to both a decline in violent conflict and the stability of an elected, civilian regime which is widely supported but not 'democratic' in the conventional sense.",304263109,,Dissertations & Theses," Kay, Bruce HowardKayHowardBruceKay, Bruce Howard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739591891 , 31582641 , 66569 , 0591235765 , 9780591235760 , 9715723 , 9715723", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 0591235765 , 9780591235760", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304263109?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history",," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," Political science , Latin American history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Violent+democratization+and+the+feeble+state%3A+Political+violence%2C+breakdown+and+recomposition+in+Peru%2C+1980-1995&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kay%2C+Bruce+Howard&amp;isbn=0591235765&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3517,Religious education in Turkey: A socio-historical study of the Imam-Hatip schools,"The question of whether and how religious functionaries such as imams and hatips should be educated has been an extremely controversial issue in Turkey for most of this century. In the midst of sweeping anti-religious reforms to create a new nation with a new identity under the guidance of rationalism and scientism, religious education was eliminated in 1924. After the introduction of the multi-party system in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, religious education re-emerged as a result of grassroots demands and pressures. Since then, the secular governments have taken a great interest in controlling and directing religious education. Despite governmental discouragement, the Imam-Hatip school system gained momentum in the 1960s and particularly in the late 1970s. These schools have shown remarkable vitality, attracting ever-increasing numbers of students. Contrary to the original legislative intent, the Imam-Hatip schools developed from a vocational system for the training of religious personnel into an alternative school system in which students receive both a religious and secular academic education at the secondary level. This study explores the relationships established between the people and the governments of Turkey under the electoral framework of the multi-party system and demonstrates that the public could and did force the government to answer the demand for Imam-Hatip schools. The Imam-Hatip school system from 1924 to the present is studied in relation to major social, political and educational developments in order to determine how socio-political factors shaped the present system of religious education in Turkey. As the case of the Imam-Hatip schools demonstrates, educational reform in Turkey has been motivated by the people's ideas and beliefs rather than imposed from above by the government. Today, a major ""post-Kemal self-discovery"" is taking place in Turkey. Concerned not only about Islam, this movement is focused on religion's potential for inculcating broad and sophisticated cognitive, emotional and ethical skills for dealing with the chaotic global, social, economic and ideological upheavals that mark the contemporary world.",304267606,,Dissertations & Theses," Tarhan, MehmetTarhanMehmetTarhan, Mehmet", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741878721 , 19497841 , 66569 , 9623807 , 9623807", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304267606?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history"," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history"," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history",," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history"," Education history , Religious education , Religious history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Religious+education+in+Turkey%3A+A+socio-historical+study+of+the+Imam-Hatip+schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tarhan%2C+Mehmet&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3518,Space-time and the city: Glasgow and the literature of the urban peripheries,"Space, as a dimension through which we experience and understand existential being, has traditionally been subsumed to time. Time, with its inextricable links to history, is seen as the privileged signifier in most social and literary critiques, while space is viewed as the deprivileged signifier. Consequently, time is associated with movement, action, and politics, while space is considered static, limited, and apolitical. To deprivilege space, however, is to fail to recognize its political potential, especially when we are within a particularly spatialized, if not global, epoch. The administrative centre of this spatialized moment is the city. It is similarly at the forefront of the Scottish literary imagination with its emphasis on that quintessentially spatial phenomenon, the ""urban"". However, Scottish, and particularly Glasgow, urban writers have concentrated on yet another aspect of the urban phenomenon; that is, those peripheralized spaces of the sometimes notorious Glasgow housing-schemes. Not only do these writers address the actual spaces of the periphery, but they simultaneously explore the 'peripheralized subject' and how this subject experiences time and space. Consequently, these literary explorations function to re-assert the active, sometimes volatile, significance of the periphery, and to resuscitate it from a certain type of historical attitude which is ultimately deterministic. In other words, the periphery and its subjects is much more than the outcome of history. To ameliorate a purely historical approach with its peculiarly Scottish impulse towards nostalgia and memory, space as a vital, living component of existential being must be considered. Whereas we make our own history although not always as we please, so too do we make our own geography. Likewise the city of Glasgow itself. As its traditional appellation as industrial, militant, proletarian begins to shift, rupture, and decline, as a new mode(s) of production (as yet not fully defined) insinuates itself, this uneasy transition necessarily has both a spatial and a historical effect. Historically, 'traditional' Glasgow is experienced as lost, or retrospectively apprehended as What Once Was. Spatially, it is experienced as displacement and atomization, if not abandonment, while the impulse towards postmodern classicism in the neo city-centre is a further testimony to that sense of uncertainty. Ultimately, rather than seeing the city and its peripheries through a purely historico-temporal prism, if the discourse is enlarged to incorporate the spatial dynamic, this may consequently lead to a recognition of the political potential invested in space and the agency subjects have within the spatial problematic.",304269297,,Dissertations & Theses," Pinnell, Lorraina BarrPinnellBarrLorrainaPinnell, Lorraina Barr", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739697661 , 32210451 , 66569 , 9780591324327 , 0591324326 , 9723569 , 9723569", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591324327 , 0591324326", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304269297?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Galloway, Janice , Kelman, James , Scotland",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Space-time+and+the+city%3A+Glasgow+and+the+literature+of+the+urban+peripheries&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pinnell%2C+Lorraina+Barr&amp;isbn=9780591324327&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3519,"Toward the second revolution: The political thought of Joaquin Maurin, 1915-1936","""Toward The Second Revolution, The Political Thought of Joaquin Maurin, 1915-1936,"" examines the evolution of the political thought of one of the leading revolutionary figures in pre-Civil War Spain. Following a youthful association with a regenerationist radical republicanism, Maurin aspired to forge a movement capable of carrying out a socialist revolution in Spain. This endeavor took him first into the anarcho-syndicalist Confederacion Nacional de Trabajo (CNT), then to the nascent Spanish Communist Party, and finally, to the leadership of the ""dissident"" communist Bloc Obrero y Campesino (BOC) and Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista (POUM). Through his prodigious and penetrating writings, Maurin was, by the early 1930s, recognized as one of the leading intellectual forces on the Spanish Left. The study is divided into seven chapters. The first three chapters focus on Maurin's early political development from 1915 to 1923, during which he evolved from a radical regenerationist republicanism to revolutionary syndicalism. Chapter 3 examines his attempt to reconcile his increasingly bolshevik perspective with the CNT's revolutionary syndicalist tactics. The fourth and fifth chapters concentrate on the period between 1923 and 1931. They examine Maurin's political development during his association with--and estrangement from--the Spanish Communist Party. They also explore his initial attempts to articulate a Marxist analysis of Spanish political, economic, and social conditions. The final two chapters trace Maurin's efforts between 1932 and 1936 to further develop this analysis and to forge an independent communist movement, first in Catalonia, and then throughout Spain. In addition to more completely elucidating the political evolution of Joaquin Maurin, ""Toward the Second Revolution"" demonstrates: that Maurin's most mature revolutionary perspective can only be understood in light of his earlier republican and revolutionary syndicalist convictions; that his overall intellectual and political development must be approached from a regional (Catalan), national, and international perspective; and finally, that it is these factors that led Maurin to develop the most original and sophisticated Marxist analysis of pre-Civil War Spanish society.",304272496,,Dissertations & Theses," Tyree, Robert AdamTyreeAdamRobertTyree, Robert Adam", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739395471 , 32055101 , 66569 , 9780591103618 , 0591103613 , 9703766 , 9703766", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591103618 , 0591103613", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304272496?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History",," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," European history , History"," Social sciences , Communism , Maur\'\i n, Joaqu\'\i n , syndicalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toward+the+second+revolution%3A+The+political+thought+of+Joaquin+Maurin%2C+1915-1936&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tyree%2C+Robert+Adam&amp;isbn=9780591103618&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3520,"Discourses of reformism: El Salvador, 1944-1960","In the period immediately after the 2nd.

The promotion of industrialization led the country to revitalize its links with neighboring countries and eventually to champion regional economic integration. This thesis focuses on the social and political determinations of this process of modernization, by analyzing the characteristics of the political system established after the 1948 military coup. This system, initially proclaimed as democratic, developed into a new form of authoritarianism that persisted up to the onset of the civil war that had just been terminated. In this work local as well as international forces which influenced the establishment of the political system are considered. The nature of the ruling coalition is discussed, as well as its transformation throughout the period. Special attention is given to the articulation of the reformist ideology as expressed in key documents of the time. The analysis emphasizes the modalities of the traditional authoritarian political culture that were recreated in the modernization project, specially (but not only) through the military presence in the ruling coalition.

The challenge is to increase the capacity of organization members and structures to include and reflect the varieties of stylistic, gender or cultural differences in the changed composition. The dissertation reports a single case study, conducted over nine months. The lived experience of organization members is explored utilizing combined methodologies of ethnography, appreciative inquiry and narratives. These combine their variety to offer a new perspective for the treatment and understanding of diversity in organizations. Findings from the study suggest that leaders and managers are eminently responsible for the success or failure of organizations to move toward more inclusive environments where diversities of people and interests exist, communicating new images of organizations. A new managerial competency, oration, which combines known competencies of conceptualization, diagnostic use of competencies and oral presentations is identified. Moving beyond the narrow focus of race, gender, age or ethnicity, a grounded theory of unitary reality is introduced. This new approach to the understanding and treatment of diversity in organizations calls for the suspension of the discussion of diversity as the desire for achievement of a permanent future state of harmonious relationship, among varieties of people and interests. Data from the study suggest that a permanent ideal future state is at best only assumed possible, and is yet undefined. What emerges is evidence that episodes of a unitary reality, or temporal sensemaking of collective singularity, contribute to feelings of organizational unity and satisfaction and occur as natural social processes in organizations. Propositions from this study call our attention to organizational processes which lead to a unitary reality These are the social interactions and centering and sensemaking processes commonly ignored as insignificant in rational, organizational processes. Additionally, it is argued that a reordering and re-valuing of processes, informal social interactions, and conversational acts like teaching talk, can not only address the consequential outcomes of fragmentation, myopic vision and statutory dialogue and interaction from previous interventions but may in fact accomplish the work of moving organizations toward a future where varieties and diversities of individuals co-exist in organizational experiences which are more inclusive and satisfying for all. The findings of this study will help to meet the need for practical, useful understanding of contemporary organizations, particularly in the current environment where varieties of people, from a wide range of constituencies are being associated through the movement toward a more global community. This study contributes new wisdom about organizations which will lead to deeper understanding of diversity in organizations and more innovative intervention strategies. The study provides hope as new strategies which more appropriately address the contemporary phenomenon of diversity in organizations are introduced.",304291981,,Dissertations & Theses," Pratt, Charleyse S.PrattS.CharleysePratt, Charleyse S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739697611 , 32210401 , 66569 , 9780591323603 , 0591323605 , 9723523 , 9723523", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591323603 , 0591323605", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304291981?accountid=14496," 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0700 Social structure"," 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0700 Social structure"," 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0700 Social structure",," 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0700 Social structure"," Management , Occupational psychology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Psychology , diversity , management , organizational development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+unitary+reality%3A+An+appreciative+inquiry&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pratt%2C+Charleyse+S.&amp;isbn=9780591323603&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3522,Unnegotiated transition...successful outcome: The processes of democratic consolidation in Greece,"This dissertation analyzes the processes through which a stable, consolidated and fully democratic regime was brought into existence in the 1970s and early 1980s in Greece by systematically and rigorously testing key hypotheses derived from the theoretical literature on democratic consolidation. Little has been written about Greece in political science, and the literature which exists is poorly developed. Despite this, Greece provides a rich opportunity for the testing of theoretical propositions found in the literature on consolidation processes. This is particularly true in light of several unusual features of its transition--its abrupt nature and the unprecedentedly dominant role in the process played by one individual, Konstantine Karamanlis. Several studies suggest that these features should have hindered Greece's prospects for a successful consolidation; yet Greece is today a fully stable and consolidated democracy. Thus, given the lack of prima facie evidence that the Greek transition trajectory fits with the most common models inherent in that literature, the ultimate contribution of this study (aside from contributing to the relatively sparse literature on the Greek case, per se) is the significant refinement in key propositions of the theoretical approaches now dominant in the literature on democratic consolidation. This dissertation focuses primarily on the roles played by political elites during and in the decade after the transition to democracy by systematically examining the four distinct transformations that forged the consensual unity required to establish a stable and consolidated regime in Greece: (1) the modernization of the Right from a questionable commitment to democracy before the 1967 dictatorship to a fully democratic stance in the post-1974 period; (2) the moderation of the Communist Left which went from engaging in anti-democratic oppositional tactics for much of its history to loyalty towards the new democratic regime; (3) the moderation of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) which went from a seemingly semi-loyal stance in the formative years of the transition to one of full loyalty once in government; and (4) the transformation of the military's attitudes and behavior which led it to retreat from political involvement and to submit itself to civilian control. Finally, recognizing that elites do not act within a political vacuum, it also undertakes an analysis of elite interactions paying careful attention to the relevant social, cultural, and international contexts, and to the linkages between elites and their respective social and political groups.",304292960,,Dissertations & Theses," Karakatsanis, Neovi MichaelKarakatsanisMichaelNeoviKarakatsanis, Neovi Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739489681 , 19513221 , 66569 , 9780591179644 , 0591179644 , 9710590 , 9710590", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591179644 , 0591179644", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304292960?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history",," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," Political science , European history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unnegotiated+transition...successful+outcome%3A++The+processes+of+democratic+consolidation+in+Greece&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Karakatsanis%2C+Neovi+Michael&amp;isbn=9780591179644&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3523,An evaluation system for CUSO: Promoting dialogue across epistemological divides in a learning organization,"CUSO$\sp1$ is a Canadian-based international non governmental organization (NGO) whose mission is to strengthen partnerships of solidarity among NGOs and social movements pursuing an agenda of social justice. As it faces cutbacks in funding, and meets requirements from its principal donor to improve planning and evaluation functions, CUSO is developing an evaluation system that meets the various needs of programmers, partners, management, the legislative Board, and donors. A basic premise of such a system is that it should be consistent with CUSO's aspirations to being a ""learning organization"". This thesis contributes to the development of CUSO's evaluation system. It analyses the implications of results-oriented management and evaluation practice which is currently being adopted at the suggestion of the principal donor. It then argues for a system that counterbalances the post positivist assumptions of a results-orientation to program evaluation by proposing participatory and consensus building evaluation approaches based on a constructivist paradigm. The strong associations linking purpose for evaluation, evaluation method, underlying epistemology, and decision-making arrangements in the organization are outlined. The implications of these associations are that participatory approaches based on a constructivist paradigm are consistent with CUSO's mission to develop partnerships of solidarity around responsive programs. For organizational learning, however, conclusions from these evaluations should be juxtaposed with conclusions from organization-wide evaluations based in the post-positivist tradition which examine program performance against CUSO's organizational objectives. The dialogue between these is ideally the site for challenging assumptions, revising the organization's analysis of the development process, and informing policy decisions. The theoretical discussion is based on three short stories conducted over a three-year period. The first is an inquiry into the different organizational needs for evaluation, as expressed by key stakeholders in the organization. The second is a case study of the development of an evaluation guide for CUSO's country program in Papua New Guinea. The third is a theoretical reflection on the application of a consensus-building approach to a regional evaluation of CUSO's programming in the Pacific. ftn $\sp1$Canadian University Service Overseas",304301868,,Dissertations & Theses," Mathie, Alison W.

International division of labor reconstitutes the labor power of Orang Bawean from that of subsistence farmer to the labor power of a migrant worker. Movements within the labor circuit are closely guarded by nation-states therefore, for physical mobility to be possible, state bureaucracies have to be approached, evaded or manipulated through links with insiders--the various oknums and calur (terms for linkages into bureaucratic offices). Various guards such as pengawal and tai kong assist in crossing boundaries. Many of them have come to play this role by attempting to move out of enclosing spaces themselves, and in the process, acquired the skills to deal with borders, boundaries, categories, documents and policing agents. Their work subverts the state's attempts at documentation because they move in a space that cannot be monitored easily by the formal bureaucracies. These generate overlapping circuits of exchange between workers and the Baweanese diaspora. A new family practice emerged--one divided by national boundaries and perhaps even national identities but unified by a newly found ethnic self, viewed as moral selves, with the help of yet a different kind of protector--spiritual guardians in the form of kiais (religious authorities). Kiais circulate within these circuits to act as linkages between parents and children or to pesantrens that practically raise children under their care. Thus, Bawean is spoken of as Pulau Santri (the island of religious novices) as well as Pulau Putri (the island of women, referring to male migration out to work). Often Baweanese aspire to get their children to become civil servants because in migrating for work, a worker often encounters dehumanizing experiences. The discourse on ethnic self enters into the cultural production of santri Bawean, and--thus, Bawean becomes inseparable with Islam and morality (disciplined or beradap).",304305977,,Dissertations & Theses," Ali, Mariam MohamedAliMohamedMariamAli, Mariam Mohamed", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 743055681 , 19785271 , 66569 , 9631624 , 9631624", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304305977?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Islam , Malay",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ethnic+hinterland%3A+Contested+spaces+between+nations+and+ethnicities+in+the+lives+of+Baweanese+labor+migrants&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ali%2C+Mariam+Mohamed&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3525,Essays in labor migration and economic development,"This dissertation consists of four essays on the theme of labor migration. The first chapter is an introduction. The second chapter examines a two-country general equilibrium trade model where transnational migrants find employment in the urban informal sector in the most country. We discuss the conditions under which such conventional concepts as ""labor exports in underemployed economies improves welfare"" do not necessarily hold. The asymmetric pattern of employment across migrants and domestic workers in turn distinguishes the welfare consequences of domestic population growth and foreign labor inflow. The presence of international labor mobility also renders ineffective several traditional corrective policy prescriptions against urban unemployment (such as unemployment tax (benefits) and foreign investment). In the third chapter we present two instances where migration reinforces its own momentum. The first example introduces the notion of cost reducing migrant networks. Through ties of kinship and other social relationships, these networks link veteran with potential migrants and serve to reduce both the physical and psychological costs of migration as the stock of migrants accumulates. The findings suggest the possibility of multiple migration equilibrium and explain the selectivity in terms of migration sources and destinations--neither of which can be accounted for when migration decisions are based on simple cost-benefit calculations. We explore the public good property of migrant networks and the suboptimality of migration flows even when laborers are perfectly mobile across geographically isolated regions. The results also stress the causal relationship between the initial stock of migrants and the migration equilibrium which ensues. The second example presents a model of brain drain which incorporates the role of quality uncertainty of prospective migrant workers. Our analysis emphasizes the impact of scale economies of education and offer an alternative explanation to the cumulative causation of the brain drain phenomenon when the possibility of migration affects education decisions. Free movement of migrants across countries is always suboptimal from the source country's viewpoint and national income maximization calls for both an education as well as an emigration tax. In the fourth chapter, we analyze the relationship between inequality in the distribution of productive assets and the propensity to migrate, in the context of an agriculturally oriented economy. We single out moral hazard on the part of hired laborers and credit market imperfection as key factors determining individual migration propensities. The findings identify the link between income inequality and the differential propensity to migrate between the haves and have nots. Ceteris paribus, a more unequal distribution of wealth implies a higher level of outmigration. The analysis also singles out redistribution of wealth originating from the rural sector itself as an avenue for alleviating the problem of excessive rural-urban migration. The fifth chapter, investigates the evolution of migration pattern when information pertaining to sectoral employment probabilities is imperfect. The chapter focuses on the interplay between belief on employment probabilities across sectors and the pattern of migration. A privately optimal migration rule is characterized and accordingly, the pattern of aggregate migration over time is traced out. We identify the long run pattern of migration under various institutional settings. We find that many common intuitions such as ""temporary policies can only have temporary effects on migration flows"", ""the poorest regions are the most migration prone areas"" and ""bilateral migration cannot be an equilibrium phenomenon"" turn out to be suspect.",304308048,,Dissertations & Theses," Chau, Nancy Ho-YanChauHo-YanNancyChau, Nancy Ho-Yan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741600901 , 19515311 , 66569 , 9617491 , 9617491", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304308048?accountid=14496," 0510 Labor economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0501 Economics"," 0510 Labor economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0501 Economics"," 0510 Labor economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0501 Economics",," 0510 Labor economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0501 Economics"," Labor economics , Economic theory , Economics", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+in+labor+migration+and+economic+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chau%2C+Nancy+Ho-Yan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3526,The victim as a hero in postwar Japan: The rise of a mythology of war victimhood,"Progressive activists cultivated Japanese pacifism after World War Two from both remorse over Japan's past as aggressor and a resolve never again to expose Japanese to the hardships of war. Yet in the 1960s a new generation led by Oda Makoto discovered that Japanese pacifism harbored an indulgent ""victim's consciousness"" (higaisha ishiki) and lacked a critical awareness of ever having inflicted suffering on others in war (kagaisha ishiki). Instead of treating victim consciousness only in the usual context of war responsibility, this dissertation on its evolution from 1945 until the 1960s analyzes war victimhood as a powerful ideological construct contested by conservatives as well as progressives. U.S. Occupation authorities inadvertently set the parameters of this struggle when they established ""the people"" as the central political entity in the postwar democratic order and encouraged the convenient belief that the militarist state had deceived and manipulated the Showa Emperor and his people into cooperating in the war effort. The victim mythology reached its purest form in the context of atomic victim exceptionalism, Japan's first powerfully unifying postwar myth which privileged the nation with an exclusive claim to leadership in the global ban-the-bomb movement in the middle 1950s. In this cold war context, nuclear victimhood transcended Japan's conventional wartime transgressions. Japanese and foreign critics routinely note that an amnesia about Japanese aggressions against Asians accompanied and abetted victim consciousness, but this study of Occupation reforms, anti-nuclear pacifism, social studies textbooks, novels and films, and victim compensation campaigns reveals that such aggressions were often remembered with clarity. Neglect of Japanese war responsibility characterized the purer, more self-absorbed discourse on victimhood, as in the ban-the-bomb movement; but Asian suffering played an essential role in progressive assertions of a common people's struggle against monopoly capitalism and the state system, and in conservative intimations of a shared Asian desire for independence from Western domination. More generally, Japanese victim mythology expressed progressive fears of a relapse into an aggressive foreign policy and oppressive domestic polity, while conservatives tried to redirect it to support a more traditional, patriotic understanding of postwar society.",304309957,,Dissertations & Theses," Orr, James JosephOrrJosephJamesOrr, James Joseph", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741561251 , 19521461 , 66569 , 9612019 , 9612019", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304309957?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0582 History"," 0332 History , 0582 History"," 0332 History , 0582 History",," 0332 History , 0582 History", History," Social sciences , Hiroshima",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+victim+as+a+hero+in+postwar+Japan%3A+The+rise+of+a+mythology+of+war+victimhood&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Orr%2C+James+Joseph&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3527,The barbarian moment: Southern New Criticism and social change,"Although Southern New Criticism was still in its infancy in 1942, young New York intellectuals like Lionel Trilling were already expressing the fears of a growing number of scholars that John Crowe Ransom and his disciples were leading American criticism astray, from a ""sense of the past"" and into the ""barbarian moment"" of formalist analysis. Ever since Trilling, moreover, the nominally objective approach sponsored by the Southerners and their fellow travellers has been accused of ""barbarism"" in many forms, whether repressing history, capitulating to the forces of social and political reaction, or even deliberately fostering what some have seen as the academy's entrenched elitism, racism, and sexism. For many poststructuralists, the New Criticism has become, in F. W. Dupee's phrase, an ""immortal scapegoat."" The irony, however, of the Jewish outsider Lionel Trilling scapegoating the Southerners so easily, can hardly have escaped Ransom, who nevertheless invited Trilling to join the editorial board of Kenyon Review that same year, and six years later to help found the Kenyon School of English. By then, of course, both were institutional insiders, but neither could forget the view from beyond the city's gates. My study examines the complex interrelations between criticism and barbarism by placing Ransom and company into two contexts: first, the ""New South"" movement, the promoters of industrialism and factory life who dominated academic and public discourse during the 1920s and 30s, and second, the Southern Renascence, the literary response to the unalloyed hubris of wholesale modernization. A concern with material history therefore underpins my analysis of the submerged connections between Southern modernism and the more dominant American tradition associated with such figures as Emerson, Whitman, Dickinson, Santayana, William James, and Wallace Stevens, and to international modernists like Laura Riding, Walter Benjamin, and Julia Kristeva. From this wide-ranging conversation, the portrait that emerges of the Southern New Critics, Ransom, Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, Robert Penn Warren, and their successor Marshall McLuhan--all of whose works wrestle with the competing claims of indigenous and non-native cultures, with a pervasive sense of exile at home, and with the utopian temptations of a ""new class"" of intellectual workers--anticipates many of the theoretical designs of contemporary ""postcolonial"" criticism.",304311832,,Dissertations & Theses," Precoda, KarlPrecodaKarlPrecoda, Karl", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739322891 , 19514291 , 66569 , 9780591077001 , 0591077000 , 9701394 , 9701394", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780591077001 , 0591077000", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304311832?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies",," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies"," American literature , American studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Ransom, John Crowe , literary theory",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+barbarian+moment%3A+Southern+New+Criticism+and+social+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Precoda%2C+Karl&amp;isbn=9780591077001&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3528,"Shanghai labour: Gender, politics, and traditions in the making of the Chinese working class, 1911-1949","Students of Chinese labour diverge widely in their approach to working class formation in China. Chinese historians tend to dismiss workers' pre-modern traditions as ""feudal remnants"" relegating the skilled craftsmen to the position of a ""labour aristocracy"" susceptible to political reformism. Working class solidarity and class consciousness tend to be depicted by Chinese scholars as rooted in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s leadership. Many western experts, in contrast, appreciate the key role played by traditional culture in workers' unionization, yet they emphasize the segmentation and differentiation of Chinese workers. Gender, as an analytic category, is understated by most scholars both inside and outside China, although this imbalance is being redressed by recent studies. This thesis explores the character of the making of the Chinese working class, drawing upon insights pioneered by E. P. Thompson, approaching class as a fluent relationship made and remade historically. Concentrating on Shanghai workers' activities in three major arenas--the workplace, the family, and the labour movement--this work examines how gender, pre-modern traditions, and national as well as international politics shaped and defined the experience of female and male workers in the Republican-era (1911-1949). The voices of Shanghai workers assumed distinct tones because of the meanings of region, skill, sex, and gang factionalism. Nevertheless, as this dissertation argues, during this period a new human relation formed that was rooted in the subordination of wage labour to capital. Workers started to express their class identity in daily conflicts with their bosses. Class consciousness manifested itself, and class solidarity superseded divisions and differences during two moments of intensified class warfare--the mid-1920s and late-1940s. Nationalism and the CCP's mobilization contributed considerably to working class formation and reconstitution in Shanghai. The labour upheaval in the late-1940s also indicates a developed working class maturity since women hands, who were usually followers in the 1920s, became central figures in the emerging working class politics of social transformation.",304317489,,Dissertations & Theses," McQuaide, Shiling ZhaoMcQuaideZhaoShilingMcQuaide, Shiling Zhao", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742547551 , 19488381 , 66569 , 9780612083707 , 0612083705 , NN08370 , NN08370", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 9780612083707 , 0612083705", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304317489?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0510 Labor economics"," 0332 History , 0510 Labor economics"," 0332 History , 0510 Labor economics",," 0332 History , 0510 Labor economics"," History , Labor economics"," Social sciences , labor",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Shanghai+labour%3A+Gender%2C+politics%2C+and+traditions+in+the+making+of+the+Chinese+working+class%2C+1911-1949&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McQuaide%2C+Shiling+Zhao&amp;isbn=9780612083707&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3529,Influence of father absence and satisfaction with parents on selected measures of nurturant fathering,"This dissertation investigated nurturant fathering as demonstrated by men of differing father-absent backgrounds. Archival data was used from a 1990 survey of 1,515 religious and highly motivated participants in fathering seminars in various regions of the United States. Reasons for father absence included death, divorce, work, and no absence. The influence of type of father absence was examined within the context of (a) participant's age at the time his father became absent, (b) participant's satisfaction with childhood relationship with father, and (c) participant's satisfaction with childhood relationship with mother. The Personal Fathering Profile (PFP) (Canfield, 1990) was used to measure eight aspects of nurturant fathering. The PFP is a 138-item, self-report instrument using 5- and 7-point Likert scales. Data was subjected to several multivariate analysis. Results indicated significant main effects for three measures of family-of-origin relationships (father absence, satisfaction with childhood relationship with father, and satisfaction with childhood relationship with mother). The global direction of these differences indicated a trans-generational movement toward healthy fathering. These differences were consistent with social learning theory and general psychodynamic theory. Participants were found to compensate for their fathers' obvious failures (e.g., amount of time spent with children) and to imitate the more subtle aspects of fathering (e.g., aspects of nurturant fathering). Isolated main effects indicated that childhood relationship with father and childhood relationship with mother made gender specific contributions to the development of instrumental and expressive fathering skills respectively. Relationship with father contributed to (a) commitment, (b) knowing children, and (c) protecting and providing. Relationship with mother contributed to (a) consistency, (b) loving spouse, and (c) active listening. Follow-up analysis indicated that the synergetic union of a father and mother contributed more to their son's development of these six measures of nurturant fathering than did the mere sum of the father's and mother's individual contributions. A father's presence influenced his life expectancy as well as the length of his wife's life. Divorce appeared to shorten life span of fathers and mothers by 10 and 18 years respectively. Work patterns where sons considered the father missing appeared to shorten life span of fathers and mothers by 6 and 12 years respectively.",304317620,,Dissertations & Theses," Swan, Donald WallaceSwanWallaceDonaldSwan, Donald Wallace", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742525831 , 19495521 , 66569 , 9625086 , 9625086", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304317620?accountid=14496," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Developmental psychology , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology"," Social sciences , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Influence+of+father+absence+and+satisfaction+with+parents+on+selected+measures+of+nurturant+fathering&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Swan%2C+Donald+Wallace&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3530,Quality of life measurement in schizophrenia: A study of the credibility of patients' reports of self-rated quality of life,"Patients' ability to appraise their quality of life in schizophrenia was studied by examining the reliability and validity of self-rated quality of life estimates. Sixty-three symptomatically stable patients with schizophrenia (DSM-II-R) receiving maintenance treatment were evaluated over a four week period. Quality of life was assessed at weekly intervals by patients of the Sickness Impact Profile, and on the first and fourth weeks by a clinician using the Social Performance Schedule &amp; Global Scale of Adaptive Functioning. A clinical profile was documented using the Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale, Drug Attitude Inventory, Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale, Hillside Akathasia Scale and a Neurocognitive test battery. The results indicated that patients' self reports were highly consistent over the four weeks (r = 0.80-0.87, p $&lt;$ 0.0001), and their quality of life ratings correlated significantly with the clinician's estimates (r = 0.52-0.54, p $&lt;$ 0.002). Further, the patients' quality of life was significantly influenced by the severity of their symptoms, side effects, cognitive deficits, the dose of their antipsychotic drugs and their attitudes toward treatment, but the reliability of their self-reports was not materially affected by these factors. Since their trustworthiness has been confirmed, it is recommended that increased emphasis be placed on patients' subjective assessments.

An integrated people-centred developmental model, which emphasises empowerment through service, is suggested as a solution to address the crisis. The African church has an important role in the implementation of the model by motivating members to address the needs of others. A new understanding of mission, which highlights service, is therefore needed. Jesus came to serve people by providing in their spiritual, emotional, and physical needs. This can be seen in His teaching and deeds which show that the Kingdom of God has entered the earth. Jesus' ministry can therefore be seen as semeiotic or disclosing service. He expects from His followers to continue with this ministry. This unified ministry was divided through the centuries. There is a return in various Christian traditions to the one ministry of Jesus. Mission can therefore be seen as semeiotic service, and the church as a serving community. Every Christian is called to serve others in his family, society, other parts of the world and the environment. It must also be realised out of the family, congregation, local community and international community. Voluntary service represents the apposite of the desire for power and wealth. Mission as semeiotic service is also voluntary service because believers serve others irrespective of compensation. The crisis in Africa can be addressed effectively through this approach. The various forms and categories of voluntary service need to be implemented in the South African situation. ""Impact: Community Volunteers Serving South Africa"" was established to embody this approach. Especially the institutionalisation of the church hampered the success of the organisation. This problem needs to be addressed if the church wants to play a role in the suggested developmental model.

That encounter culminated in the incorporation of the Independent State of Western Samoa created and defined by members of a Samoan political elite in collaboration with members of the New Zealand colonial elite. Since the incorporation of the independent State of Western Samoa, successive government elites in collaboration with aid donors have attempted to implement a state-centered model of and for development directed toward the goals of national self-reliance and a condition of improved economic well-being for all Samoans. Government strategies have focused on the development of relations with patron states that provide aid in the form of grants, loans, technology, and technicians for investment, for the most part, in large state-owned commercial ventures and infrastructural projects. Unfortunately, government strategies have failed to achieve either a movement toward national self-reliance or enhanced economic well-being for the majority of Samoans. The Government development practices have not effectively mobilized and utilized rural resources, specifically, the rural institutions of land and labour, as tools for raising productivity in the rural sector of the economy. Instead the production of export crops has stagnated or declined, and government attempts to utilize land for forestry or infrastructural projects have been met, more of the than not, with resistance from people living in the rural areas. Furthermore, young Samoans continue to migrate out of the rural areas leaving their families short of labour and struggling to produce a surplus in addition to their subsistence requirements.",89158675,,Dissertations & Theses," Luther, Eudene OnileeLutherOnileeEudeneLuther, Eudene Onilee", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739484251 , 19187061 , 66569 , 0612136671 , 9780612136670 , NN13667 , NN13667", Dissertation/Thesis, 1996," 0612136671 , 9780612136670", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/89158675?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," Cultural anthropology , Economics , Urban planning , Area planning & development"," Social sciences , Samoa , rural communities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Development+and+resistance%3A+Rural+resistance+to+economic+development+practices+in+Western+Samoa&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Luther%2C+Eudene+Onilee&amp;isbn=0612136671&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3533,"British ideological movements and irish politics, 1865-1925","This thesis is concerned with the movement in British public opinion towards the acceptance of Irish self-government in the years 1865-1925. The thesis is divided into three parts, each of which investigates an ideological grouping (largely represented in the periodical or newspaper press) which contributed significantly to this movement. The first part is concerned with the British followers of Auguste Comte in the late nineteenth century. The Comtean Positivists were the first significant group of educated Britons to endorse Irish independence. Although they derived these unusual convictions from the most visionary features of Comte's system, their advocacy significantly affected the late nineteenth-century debate on Anglo-Irish relations. The second part concerns new Liberalism. It is generally thought that Edwardian Liberal advocates of social reform were apathetic about Ireland; but one tradition within radical Liberalism was persistent and coherent in its support of Irish self-government. This group helped to popularise Home Rule from 1886, until the Anglo-Irish war of 1919-21. The final section concerns Imperialists (or advocates of Imperial ""consolidation"") in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the other two groups, these were not Home Rulers by conviction, and they endeavoured to preserve as much constitutional unity as possible in the United Kingdom. But in the second decade of the twentieth century, they came to regard some form of Irish autonomy as inevitable, and, in some cases, assisted the establishment of the Irish Free State in official capacities. This study concludes that changing British perceptions of the Empire and of the international community in these years produced a significantly more favourable attitude in Britain to the idea of Irish self-government. Indeed, it was partly because attitudes were changed by events exogenous to Ireland itself that problems remained after 1925 both with Ireland, and in British perceptions of the country.",1767630894,,Dissertations & Theses," Peatling, G.

It analyses the historical background of the Caribs from the time of their initial contact with Europeans and Africans through the period of colonisation, and considers the effects which the centuries of culture exchange have had on the indigenous societies of Dominica up to the present. This heritage is considered in relation to the cultural revival movement which has developed since the 1980s as part of the hemispheric action being initiated by indigenous peoples of the Americas for greater recognition and rights. Promoting Carib identity in this context has become important to the community on many levels. The thesis assesses the manner in which the Caribs are using their history, material culture, and association with their land to articulate their indigenousness in the face of the centuries of cultural and biological admixture with people of European and African descent known as Creoles. The thesis concludes that although it may be true that these symbols are distorted and exaggerated, they are not entirely invented, for they originate in the history and culture of the Carib people. Even if, in many ways, the Caribs have become as Creole as their fellow countrymen, the social fact is, that in the present circumstances, they see it as important and advantageous to define themselves as Caribs in their engagement with Creole nationalism and the world beyond. By promoting their association with the cultural markers of Caribness, their cultural activists seek to engage with the current international concern and interest in indigenous groups in the hope that it might eventually reap some good for their people.",301491240,,Dissertations & Theses," Honychurch, LennoxHonychurchLennoxHonychurch, Lennox", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757610061 , 44651381 , 101309 , U097414 , U097414", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301491240?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAIU097414 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Carib+to+creole%3A+contact+and+culture+exchange+in+dominica&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Honychurch%2C+Lennox&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3536,"The personal narrative of edith simcox: an annotated transcription of her autobiography of a shirt maker, and detailed introduction of her life and works","This thesis is concerned with the life and works of Edith Jemima Simcox (1844-1910), and offers a detailed introduction to, and annotated transcription of, her holograph journal, Autobiography of a Shirt Maker (1876-1900).

The first chapter considers the presence of gold in many different social institutions and shows how gold moves in similar ways in each. It is in the movement of gold between persons, and in the changing emphases on the potential of the substance, that the value of gold is to be found. Exchanges of gold give the gold bazaar a unique form. The chapter on markets sees the bazaar as the local articulation of a global commodity. The market is viewed as a social structure within which the primary process is the negotiation of the purity of gold. The chapter dealing with saving, lending and spending shows how, in the Indian context, the possibility of borrowing money against the security of gold means that women view investment in gold as a form of saving. The purchase of gold is simultaneously saving and consumption. As a valuable and potentially economically productive substance, the importance of gold has generally been underestimated in explanations of dowry. By looking at gold as an alternative form of property to land, this chapter seeks to understand the meaning of women's ownership of gold. Gold in India is perceived as embodying the same ambiguous mixture of good and evil as women. The chapter on adornment deals with both the symbolic and the practical uses of gold and other precious things, both worn on the body and consumed in medicine. This thesis uses a single substance as its main focus in an attempt to expand what can be seen as 'economic' within anthropology.

The assumption of development economists and policy makers, influenced by neo-classical economics, is that a change in ownership will be associated with superior management performance through improved accounting controls. This study, based on an intensive case study, argues that such assumptions can be over-simplistic and erroneous. The study analyses management controls in the light of the labour process theory paying due attention to intra-organisational conflict, the manufacture of workers' consent and inherent organisational contradictions in the context of wider socio-political factors. Thus, the methodological focus of the research resides in the political economy of work and organisations. In particular, it seeks to extend Burawoy's theorisation of organisation control and consent to accounting in the context of privatisation with a developing country. This theoretical model perceives control as the outcome of interactions of external and internal factors. Accounting is implicated in those interactions. The data for this study was collected from one organisation which had three phases of ownership: public sector, partial privatisation and privatisation. The data covered the historical changes of state policies, trade union movements in Bangladesh and the transformations of internal controls. An examination of the empirics thus collected helps explain the change of controls including accounting in a wider environment. The study argues that internal control processes are conditioned by external issues. For example, during the pre-privatisation periods, PC's control was politicised and bureaucratic due to the influence of state politics and strong trade union movements. Following the changes of external issues, that is, changes in state policies and weaker trade union movements, which are influenced by international aid agencies, control processes in the privatised firm have substantially changed.",301508305,,Dissertations & Theses," Uddin, S.N.UddinS.N.Uddin, S.N.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757689551 , 44675761 , 101309 , U095728 , U095728", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301508305?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," (UMI)AAIU095728 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+management+control+systems+in+privatisation%3A++a+labour+process+analysis+of+a+Bangladeshi+case+study.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Uddin%2C+S.N.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3539,"Myth, prejudice and vested interest: political and cultural influences on history teaching in British secondary schools, 1945 - 1995.","Introduction. The introduction identifies a variety of pressures bearing on secondary school history, analysing their role in producing substantial changes, short-term experiments and reversals of policy over fifty years. Chapter 1. Some Academic Controversies and Antecedents. This chapter traces the transmission of ideas from major historians through universities to school departments, drawing on evidence from the Historical Association, the JMB and a representative sample of school textbooks. Chapter 2. School History and the Politics of Post-War Reconstruction. Chapter 2 examines evidence from two major post-war developments; the improvement of international understanding and the provision of a varied and effective humanities education for senior pupils in the new technical and secondary modern schools. The increasing importance of educational sociology in curriculum theory is also explored. Chapter 3. Integrated Humanities and Social Studies: Challenge or Support to History? The main issue discussed here is the promotion of integrated humanities courses and social studies by the Schools Council and the resultant challenge to history's place on the timetable. The new movement and the traditionalist responses it provoked are considered with reference to the Nuffield Humanities, MACOS and Keele projects, together with some school-based initiatives. Chapter 4. The Defence of History. Chapter 4 reviews early proposals for improvement such as textbook reform, school-based experiments, and the application of Bloom's 'objectives' theory, mainly as interpreted by Coltham and Fines. This section is followed by an analysis of the Schools Council 13-16 History Project (1972) (SCHP) and the controversy surrounding it.",301526182,,Dissertations & Theses," Leighton, J.LeightonJ.Leighton, J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757654331 , 44665651 , 101309 , U095411 , U095411", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301526182?accountid=14496, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history,, 0520 Education history, Education history," (UMI)AAIU095411 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Myth%2C+prejudice+and+vested+interest%3A++political+and+cultural+influences+on+history+teaching+in+British+secondary+schools%2C+1945+-+1995.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leighton%2C+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3540,Church and politics in the theology of Jose Miguez-Bonino and Allan Boesak.,"Since the early 1970s, many Christians have come to the realisation that the churches world-wide have a profound impact on the shaping of a nation's socio-economic and political agenda. Issues and debates within the Church are shaped by the interplay between intra-Church theological and ecclesiastical concerns and national/international ideological and institutional patterns to which churches must adapt. Newly emerging socio-political situations, such as the emergence of democracy in South Africa, complicate the Church's continued search for its prophetic voice: What does it mean to have a concern for social justice, peace, and to maintain a ""preferential option for the poor"" when the world's political order is continually in transition? This thesis explores the debates that surround the Church's relationship to politics by focusing on the contemporary theological movement known as ""liberation theology"" and objections that have been raised by its more conservative and liberal opponents. It specifically examines and compares the way Jose Miguez-Bonino from Latin America and Allan Boesak from South Africa, have responded to the theological challenges set by their surrounding social realities and how they have answered the criticisms from Europe and North America. We argue that the theology of these two men offers a more adequate understanding of the relationship between Church, theology, and politics than their critics because of the importance Miguez-Bonino and Boesak give to a praxis that reflects the needs of the poor and oppressed.",301549822,,Dissertations & Theses," Poit, J.C.PoitJ.C.Poit, J.C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757638801 , 44660211 , 101309 , U088818 , U088818", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301549822?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology,, 0469 Theology, Theology," (UMI)AAIU088818 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Church+and+politics+in+the+theology+of+Jose+Miguez-Bonino+and+Allan+Boesak.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Poit%2C+J.C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3541,"Brutal responsibilities and second-class citizens: Women soldiers, martial citizenship, and feminist anti-militarism","This dissertation addresses women's incorporation to the United States' armed forces by placing it in political, historical, and social context. From common roots in the women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s, women have been approaching the military from two perspectives: feminist antimilitarists have been criticizing the military for its masculinist culture, while women interested in joining the military have insisted that it is their right to participate, and that the military is the sine qua non of full citizenship. This project explores a series of questions about women soldiers, women's citizenship, feminist antimilitarism, and the culture of patriarchal militarism to untangle some of the interesting and troublesome questions about women and the military. The method of analysis used in the dissertation is interdisciplinary, combining historiography, sociology, ethnography, and political theory in the United States' context to view a series of historical moments in congressional testimony, court cases addressing equality, feminist movements for equality, feminist antimilitarist perspectives on and responses to the military, and histories of martial citizenship, including women's. These materials are investigated for their political importance in shaping public understandings of the military as gendered, for their importance in building a discourse of expanded citizenship claims, and for their contributions to shifting the terrain of citizenship and equality. The dissertation suggests, in view of these materials, that feminist scholars of the military, and of militarism, must account for the changing demographics of the armed forces by examining the contested meanings of citizenship, the effects of technological advances, and the economic imperatives that together comprise the conditions through which women access advancement in the military. Furthermore, the dissertation demonstrates that women's entry to the military is a critical juncture for several reasons: (1) It is a challenge to the structured masculinity of military culture, (2) It informs studies of the international economies in which women become the primary, but low-waged, workers, and (3) It marks a need for feminist antimilitarists to re-evaluate their approach to the topics of soldiering, women, and peace.",304332588,,Dissertations & Theses," Feinman, Ilene RoseFeinmanRoseIleneFeinman, Ilene Rose", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740127771 , 28358181 , 66569 , 0591484099 , 9780591484090 , 9738149 , 9738149", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 0591484099 , 9780591484090", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304332588?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," American studies , American history , Political science , Womens studies"," Social sciences , soldiers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Brutal+responsibilities+and+second-class+citizens%3A+Women+soldiers%2C+martial+citizenship%2C+and+feminist+anti-militarism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feinman%2C+Ilene+Rose&amp;isbn=0591484099&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3542,"Women in transition, health care in translation: Nicaraguan women and the challenge of cervical cancer prevention","Nicaragua, a small Central American country, has suffered from centuries of colonial exploitation, social and political unrest, and inconceivable numbers of natural disasters. The health of the population, especially women, reflects the harsh realities of their lives. Extreme poverty, religious conservatism, machismo, and social and interpersonal violence, neglect, and sexual exploitation have left a legacy of high fertility, chronic pelvic pain, and extremely high rates of cervical cancer among women. Despairing of government, religious, or family support, women themselves have organized a vast network of services including new models of health care. Women's clinics, supported by the international women's health movement, have sprung up all over the country since 1990 to provide a wide variety of services for and by women. These clinics are widely perceived as positively affecting the emotional well being of their clients. A key service provided in these clinics is Pap screening for the prevention of cervical cancer. There are indications from around the country that cervical cancer is increasing in incidence. The clinics' effectiveness in preventing significant cervical disease is unknown. This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of these new clinics in reducing the toll of cervical disease on the lives of Nicaraguan women. Using methods from medical anthropology and clinical epidemiology, structured and semi-structured interviews, participant observation, STD testing and Pap smears, the activities of women's clinics and the reproductive tract disease burden of their clients were evaluated from October 1995 through July 1996. Clinical examinations were conducted on a random sample of 248 women that regularly utilized the services of three women's clinics in Esteli, Nicaragua. Results show that a significant portion of women with evidence of cervical disease are missed in the existing programs. I conclude that this difficulty reflects the limited operating funds, lack of education, and quality controls found throughout the Nicaraguan health care system, but more importantly it illustrates the difficulties encountered when technology and health care concepts are transferred from one cultural setting to another. All technology, including the Pap smear, embeds a number of unquestioned cultural assumptions that induce unexpected results in translation.",304343056,,Dissertations & Theses," McCue, Maureen F.McCueF.MaureenMcCue, Maureen F.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739927551 , 27564541 , 66569 , 9780591410587 , 0591410583 , 9731840 , 9731840", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780591410587 , 0591410583", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304343056?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0453 Womens studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0453 Womens studies"," Cultural anthropology , Public health , Womens studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , cancer prevention , epidemiology , medical anthropology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+in+transition%2C+health+care+in+translation%3A+Nicaraguan+women+and+the+challenge+of+cervical+cancer+prevention&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCue%2C+Maureen+F.&amp;isbn=9780591410587&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3543,"Female elites, women's formal associations, and political practices in urban Mali (West Africa)","This work investigates Malian women's formal associations and their participation in local and national politics from the late 'fifties until the present. Building on both historical and ethnographic data, it details a multiplicity of ways in which Malian women influence political events. It does so by highlighting the often opaque political implications of women's ritual and economic activities. Women's formal organizations may constitute often covert but powerful electoral lobbies. They work as mediators between state institutions and citizens and may be asked by local power holders to enforce administrative changes at the local level. Moreover, women's groups represent a major reference point for local and international aid agencies in search of development partners. This work begins with a critical review of some of the available literature on village politics. It tries to account for the ways that memories of the past have informed people's political practices during the struggle for independence from France. The work continues with discussing a number of institutional transformations that women's formal organizations have gone through from the colonial era to the present. While it describes the diverse historical phases of the women's movement, the main goal remains to further an understanding of the relationship between political practices and local culture. At the center of my discussion I situate the patronage system, since relationships among women within their organizations are far from egalitarian. Building on work by Amselle, Bagayogo and Lambert de Frondeville, I present patron-client relationships as an orienting paradigm within women's political associations. This discussion allows me to focus on the ways in which women's political activism, social distinctions, and Mande social philosophy intertwine in the practices and representations of female group members. I explore the multiple dimensions of the patronage system in Mali by looking at leaders' professional identities, motivations, cultural values, and political practices. I include glimpses detailing how leaders are viewed from the bottom up, and spend some time to describe women's communal activities, especially during feast time. I conclude by drawing some implications of my study for a general understanding of politics in Mali.

This research applies the co-citation methodology, developed and validated for mapping the structure of the science and social science literatures, to the literature of the visual arts. Co-mention, a co-word measure, is substituted for the co-citation unit of analysis. The study derives style structure from the visual arts literature using the multivariate techniques of cluster analysis, factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling applied to co-mention matrices derived from two bibliographical databases, Art Literature International (RILA) and Arts &amp; Humanities Search$\sp\circler$. The co-mention methodology is validated by the comparison of the classification produced by each of the two source databases with the independent qualitative classification of artists synthesized by Diana Crane in her book The Transformation of the Avant-Garde: the New York Art World, 1940-1995, from the major critics and historians of the period. The Rand Index, R$\sb{\rm g}$, provided a metric for comparison of the groupings obtained and produced ratings xindicating very good agreement between each of the database-generated classifications and the qualitative synthesis (3-D RILA and synthesis: R$\sb{\rm g}$ = 0.8873; 3-D AHCI and synthesis: R$\sb{\rm g}$ = 0.8297), as well as between the two quantitative classifications (R$\sb{\rm g}$ = 0.8070). Additional support for the validity of the method can be seen from the consistency of the structures produced by the three different quantitative techniques. The multidimensional scaling produced maps which provide coherent displays of the structures (RILA: 3-D RSQ = 0.799, stress = 0.170; AHCI: 3-D RSQ = 0.758, stress = 0.188). SPSS's INDSCAL scaling model of the ALSCAL procedure was used to compare the two maps and indicated a moderately good fit (3-D RSQ = 0.604, stress = 0.240).

Previous studies of the conflict typically addressed French guerrillas, known as francs-tireurs, in a cursory manner, often portraying them as little more than bandits and outlaws who proved a greater threat to the French population than to the enemy. Drawing upon important German and French primary source material such as diaries, memoirs, military orders, dispatches, and official proclamations, this study demonstrates that the earlier assessments have generally mischaracterized francs-tireurs as a whole and underestimated the degree to which irregulars positively effected their nation's war effort, destroying rail and telegraph lines, ambushing isolated columns and requisitioning patrols, conducting screening operations, providing intelligence, harrying siege perimeters, restricting the movements of major enemy units, and ultimately prolonging the war by two or three months. Francs-tireurs were not a homogeneous group, neither geographically nor ideologically. Demographic information reveals that franc-tireur units consisted overwhelmingly of males of all social classes and geographic regions and several foreign nations. Political philosophies varied among them, but nationalistic sentiments motivated most francs-tireurs to arm themselves and organize or join irregular guerrilla bands. Initially, the Germans perceived them as little more than a nuisance but as the war progressed and franc-tireur operations multiplied, they had to expend substantial manpower and material resources to protect their lines of communications from these formidable and elusive opponents. German counterguerrilla efforts which most often consisted of monetary fines, but also hostage taking, executions, and the burning of villages, ultimately achieved moderate success, convincing many French, just before war's end, to leave the fighting to the military. Never regarding the francs-tireurs as legitimate combatants entitled to the rights accorded soldiers under the laws of war, the Germans maintained vehemently throughout the conflict that warfare was reserved strictly for professional armies and that shielding civilians as much as possible from the horrors of war could be accomplished only if civilians refused to involve themselves in warfare, an argument which led subsequently to international conferences concerning the laws of land warfare to determine among other things the legal definition of combatants.",304348864,,Dissertations & Theses," Hatley, Paul BuchananHatleyBuchananPaulHatley, Paul Buchanan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 736832801 , 27261351 , 66569 , 0591684810 , 9780591684810 , 9817132 , 9817132", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 0591684810 , 9780591684810", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304348864?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History",," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," European history , History"," Social sciences , France , Prussia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Prolonging+the+inevitable%3A+The+franc-tireur+and+the+German+Army+in+the+Franco-German+War+of+1870-1871&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hatley%2C+Paul+Buchanan&amp;isbn=0591684810&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3546,"The centrality of mutuality, Africentric values, and ethnic identity on the socio-emotional functioning of adolescent girls","The scholarly study of adolescent development can be fairly characterized as male-centered and Caucasian-centered. Consequently, current theories of adolescent psychological growth and development rarely reflect the socio-cultural realities of African-American girls. The present study was predicated on two theoretical frameworks: relational theory (Jordan, Kaplan, Miller, Stiver, &amp; Surrey, 1991) and NTU theory (Phillips, 1990). This investigation examined the relationship of mutuality, Afrikan values, and ethnic identity to the self-concept and socio-emotional functioning of adolescent girls. It was hypothesized that different categories of perceived mutuality (e.g., relational orientation, unidirectional orientation, and social-isolation orientation) in same-sex peer relationships would be related to self-concept. Subsumed under this hypothesis was the extent to which these categories would be related to socio-emotional behaviors. Mutuality refers to the bidirectional movement of feelings, thoughts, and activity between persons in relationships. Socio-emotional behaviors are defined as indices of school functioning, such as rule compliance, social skills, school interests, anxiety and withdrawal. A second question explored the extent to which Afrikan values are positively related to self-concept and favorable socio-emotional behaviors. The third hypothesis addressed the extent to which ethnic identity would be related to self-concept and socio-emotional behaviors. Finally, it was hypothesized that different categories of perceived mutuality (e.g., relational orientation, unidirectional orientation, and social-isolation orientation) in adolescent-adult relationships would be related to self-concept. Subsumed under this hypothesis was the extent to which these categories would be related to socio-emotional behaviors. Archival data were obtained on ninety-nine African-American girls ages 10–14. The participants, in a group setting, were administered the Mutual Psychological Development Questionnaire, African Value Scale for Children, Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale and the Children's Rating Scale. Correlational and canonical results indicated that the participants strongly endorsed the centrality of mutuality in both relationship types (e.g., same-sex peer and adolescent-adult relationships). However, the categories of mutuality in both relationship types were not significantly associated with self-concept nor socio-emotional functioning. Ethnic identity was a salient predictor of global self-concept as well as several facets of self-concept. The hypothesized significant relationship between ethnic identity and socio-emotional functioning was also confirmed. Additionally, ethnic identity was significantly correlated with specific dimensions of socio-emotional functioning. Afrikan values were statistically significant in relation to one facet of self-concept; although, these values were not significant in understanding socio-emotional functioning. The concept of mutuality for African-American girls is situated within a cultural context. The primary implication of this study is that ethnic identity is an influential component in the lives of African-American adolescent girls. It is also suggested that school-related behaviors are directly related to positive evaluations' of one's ethnic group.",304350151,,Dissertations & Theses," Charlot-Swilley, DominiqueCharlot-SwilleyDominiqueCharlot-Swilley, Dominique", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732788501 , 26827071 , 66569 , 9780599095601 , 0599095601 , 9911307 , 9911307", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780599095601 , 0599095601", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304350151?accountid=14496," 0625 Personality , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0620 Developmental psychology , 0451 Social psychology , 0325 African Americans"," 0625 Personality , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0620 Developmental psychology , 0451 Social psychology , 0325 African Americans"," 0625 Personality , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0620 Developmental psychology , 0451 Social psychology , 0325 African Americans",," 0625 Personality , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0620 Developmental psychology , 0451 Social psychology , 0325 African Americans"," Personality , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Developmental psychology , Social psychology , African Americans"," Social sciences , Psychology , Adolescent , Africentric , Ethnic identity , Girls , Mutuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+centrality+of+mutuality%2C+Africentric+values%2C+and+ethnic+identity+on+the+socio-emotional+functioning+of+adolescent+girls&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Charlot-Swilley%2C+Dominique&amp;isbn=9780599095601&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3547,"Presentation, modernism, and post-colonialism: Korean Informel and the reception of the West","This dissertation discusses Informel, the most significant abstract art movement in recent Korean art history, which flourished from 1957 to 1965. In spite of the fact that modern Western oil painting had been introduced to Korea in 1910, Informel was the fist self-consciously avant-garde movement in the nation's history. As the first major cultural product in postwar Korea, Informel embodies the transformation of the society, in particular a desire for modernization and modernity, formed and led by intellectuals and the young social elite. The discourse of modernization accompanied expanded ideals on Western elements such as democracy, freedom, individualism, and enlightenment. Korean Informel began to emerge in the third Hyundai Artists Association exhibition--the group consisted of young artists who aimed to breach the conventional way of art-making and to challenge a dominant style, the Japanese-mediated French Impressionism. Informel works represent the drip technique, large scale, violent gesture, rough brushwork, strong color and abstract style. Most of the Hyundai artists suggested that behind these formal similarities with those of Western examples lay Korea's frustration with authority and its people's anger after the brutal Korean War. However, from 1960, Korean artists actively developed their own individual style rediscovering Korean traditional art. Hyundai artists branched out and developed diverse abstract styles. The artists including Seo-bo Park, Myung-no Youn, Sang-hwa Chung, and Chang-sup Chung, commanded very dark and rough surfaces built up with mixed media such as plaster and other materials. While Tschang-yeul Kim, Sung-soon Chang, Chang-kwon Kim and other young fellow artists adopted a simpler composition with calligraphic lines. And all of these artists explored traditional Asian visual features with Korean sensibility. For example, techniques of traditional Korean painting, such as using ink of various tones with abstract surface structure and contrasts between positive and negative space with absolute tranquility, were combined in Informel style. Informel was the most successful example of internalizing the Western avant-garde art incorporating the indigenous dialogue of Korea. Informel, diversified and expanded into various media and artists, signified the abstract style in general and caused a further exploration of other Western avant-garde styles. Informel artists actively participated in the international art fairs such as the Paris and Sao Paolo biennales, and this enhanced their status in Korea. The Korean art world turned its focus to abstract style and since then, the recognition and practice of avant-garde became the most significant subject among the artists. Informel was developed intertwined with the social discourse of modernization; intellectuals proclaimed the Western examples of philosophy and their systems of production. In this discourse, the desire to change conflicted with their identity, but as the subject of the change, Koreans took a critical position to both the realms of tradition and the West. As Homi Bhabha discusses, Korean modernization crystallizes the ambiguous stage of identity and an active involvement of mimicry. Informel, symbolizing the imperative to modernize the Korean art world that forebodes the advent of broad reception of the West, represents this ambivalent situation of involvement in the discourse of modernism.

It establishes a corpus of imagery and systematically studies how it relates to the multiple aspects and aspirations of the Popular Front. It underlines the aesthetic as well as the political diversity of the artists who participated in the Popular Front, from Robert Delaunay's abstraction to Boris Taslitzky's French brand of social realism, in order to explore how democratic participation and internal debate contributed to an ongoing effort to define politically engaged art and the role of the artist in the antifascist cause. The dissertation furnishes criteria for defining art of the Popular Front springing from the alliance's structure as a mass movement, an electoral coalition, and an elected government by using its political and cultural organizations and programs as an institutional framework. It takes artists' participation in the organizations' debates and exhibitions and in the alliance's public demonstrations as indicators of Popular Front involvement. Moreover, it identifies and analyzes the primary themes in art appearing in such contexts, including the portrayal of street agitation, key Popular Front events and values, the government social achievements and programs, and the Spanish Civil War. Arranged both chronologically and thematically, the study examines the commemorative function of early street art and imagery of the street in establishing a history of Popular Front events and in tracing a lineage of 18th- and 19th-century revolutionary struggles and cultural traditions. Such early art contained contestatory and affirmative charges which related to the often contradictory alliance propositions of antifascism and peace. These charges informed the Debates on Realism and ultimately became fragmented into distinct functions in affirmative government art and contestatory art of the Spanish Civil War. The study concludes that, among the western democratic powers, the Popular Front in France was the force most able to mobilize a coherent yet diverse artistic response to the totalizing projects of the three dictatorships with which it was faced.",304362385,,Dissertations & Theses," Miliotes, Diane HelenMiliotesHelenDianeMiliotes, Diane Helen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 736775141 , 27245921 , 66569 , 9780591654141 , 0591654148 , 9814269 , 9814269", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780591654141 , 0591654148", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304362385?accountid=14496," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history"," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history"," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history",," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history"," Art History , European history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Delaunay, Robert , France , Taslitzky, Boris",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Antifascist+art+of+the+Popular+Front+in+Paris%2C+1934-1938&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miliotes%2C+Diane+Helen&amp;isbn=9780591654141&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3549,A socio-biography of Shirley Graham-Du Bois: A life in the struggle,"Many people, when they think of Shirley Graham-Du Bois, tend to locate and situate her political, cultural, and intellectual life and accomplishments during her marriage to W. E. B. Du Bois. On the face of it this may seem to be an accurate representation of Graham's life. This perspective, however, obscures and marginalizes the significance of Graham's life and work before she became Du Bois's wife. This dissertation assesses how Shirley Graham-Du Bois was a leading cultural, political and intellectual figure (beginning in the 1920s and continuing throughout her prolific life). Graham constructed and enacted an intellectual, cultural, and political life which was constantly in tension with the dominant constructions, both within and outside of the black community, of gender, race, and nation. I discuss how Graham beginning with the late 1920s and continuing through the 1930s, 1940s, up to the early 1950s effectively generated, cultural, personal, and political spaces which were oppositional in her lifetime and foreshadowed many contributions to black feminism in particular and woman's studies in general. These areas of concern are investigated by using Socio-biography through qualitative methods. Socio-biography as a method is valuable because it makes visible the interplay between the experience of the individual and social structure. More importantly it highlights how the individual through agency and social structure are shaped by each other. Socio-biography fills the ""knowledge gap"" by and revealing the informal organizational structure that existed in the Black Colleges of Graham's days, within the formal organizational structure that limited Graham because of her gender in her teaching career. Socio-biography exposes the ""production of obscurity"": which argues that women's lives tend not to get the same attention and weight that men's lives do. That there has been a practice and system of silencing and marginalizing the lives, work, and activities of women. Through in-depth interviews, biographies, and correspondence I have found and document the breadth and depth of Graham's intellectual, cultural, and political life as a writer of operas and plays in the 1930s and early 1940s, biographer heroic African Americans (male and female) and active member and organizer in the 1940s of the International Peace Movement, and well as a founding member of the Progressive Party in 1948. By exposing Graham's accomplishments while she negotiated politics, career, and motherhood I show how Graham refused to be compartmentalized in any particular role, but was mother, career person, and political person all at once, and because of the complexity of her life I also further expose how Graham's life and work has been left-out of, and marginalized in gender, race, and ethnic studies.",304362540,,Dissertations & Theses," Thompson, Robert Dee, Jr.ThompsonDeeRobertJr.Thompson, Robert Dee, Jr.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 736882221 , 26825811 , 66569 , 9780591750461 , 0591750465 , 9823045 , 9823045", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780591750461 , 0591750465", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304362540?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0304 Biographies"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0304 Biographies"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0304 Biographies",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0304 Biographies"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Womens studies , Social research , Biographies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Graham Du Bois, Shirley",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+socio-biography+of+Shirley+Graham-Du+Bois%3A+A+life+in+the+struggle&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thompson%2C+Robert+Dee%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9780591750461&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3550,The abundant life prevails: Religious traditions of Saint Helena Island,"In 1862 two religious traditions collided on Saint Helena Island on the coast of South Carolina. One was an imported faith found primarily at the Penn School where Northern missionaries emphasized citizenship, character development, service, and self-discipline. The other, older religious tradition was that of the newly freed island slaves, representing a mixture of Southern evangelicalism and African traditional religious practice. This study demonstrates how each of these traditions emerged from their own community environment, sought particular goals for the island, influenced each other and eventually merged. Saint Helena Island and the Penn School are historically important because the island was used as a ""rehearsal for reconstruction"" when the area fell into Union hands in November of 1861. The Penn School was part of the ""Port Royal Experiment"" which sought to prove to a skeptical America that the former slaves could be good, responsible citizens. By the turn of the century, the Penn School faced various financial and leadership problems and therefore, a new cadre of missionaries arrived to conduct an ""experiment"" in educational salvation focusing on ""character development"" among the African-American islanders. Changing circumstances brought new crises to Saint Helena in the 1940s and the island became a center for the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s. The history of the island sheds enormous light on social progressivism and the nation's efforts to solve the ""Negro problem."" Numerous national progressive figures such as George Peabody, Julius Rosenwald, Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin Luther King, Jr. took an interest in Saint Helena Island. While national and even international attention was focused on Saint Helena, the local people of the island went about their lives, a major component of which was their own style of religion. The churches and pray's houses were the dominant institutions providing a place for community fellowship; for solving legal disputes because the islanders would not carry their cases before white judges on the mainland; and for guiding the people in seeking ecstatic, spiritual visions from God.",304371318,,Dissertations & Theses," Wolfe, Michael CharlesWolfeCharlesMichaelWolfe, Michael Charles", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 736562901 , 26833351 , 66569 , 9780591504682 , 0591504685 , 9738876 , 9738876", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780591504682 , 0591504685", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304371318?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history"," 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history"," 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history",," 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history"," Religion , Theology , American history , Black history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Penn School , South Carolina",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+abundant+life+prevails%3A+Religious+traditions+of+Saint+Helena+Island&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wolfe%2C+Michael+Charles&amp;isbn=9780591504682&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3551,Finnish music and the a cappella choral works of Einojuhani Rautavaara,"Over his long and varied career, Einojuhani Rautavaara has become one of the leading figures in contemporary Nordic music.

Beginning with the movement's origins in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) and the prophetic visions in 1947 of its founder Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oshoffa, the dissertation describes the events and processes which led to the Church's growth and international expansion. It details the social and administrative organization of the Celestial Church, highlighting how its notion of a ""spiritual hierarchy"" informs its bureaucracy, finances, and local parish government. The work emphasizes the nature of Celestial angels and points out their central role in Church cosmology, doctrinal tenets, and religious assumptions. The dissertation depicts the spatial context for Celestial Church ritual activity, its iconography, the constitution of its worship altars, and the design of its ""Holy Land."" It characterizes the style of ritual dress worn by Celestians, and the symbolic nature of the various substances and elements employed in Celestial ritual. The work presents the forms of ritual invocation, speech, bodily postures and gestures, offerings, spirit possession, and healing techniques in the Church, and then demonstrates how each, as different units of practice, cohere into complete Celestial Church worship services. Beyond ethnographic description, this dissertation also develops an explicit theory of ritual which accounts for how members of particularly new, and apparently syncretic, religious movements like the Celestial Church of Christ can successfully invent a sense of tradition. Drawing upon measurement theory with its distinction between accuracy and precision, practice theory with its understanding of ritual as practice, and numerical taxonomy with its distinction between monothetic and polythetic classification, the thesis argues that ritual practice has significant taxonomic consequences. The argument submits that being implicated in ritual practice defines for participating agents, objects, and spaces a context dependent ""operational identity"" which includes a monothetic status of tradition. Finally, by emphasizing the centrality of ritual for the Church, this dissertation also proposes a novel explanation for the extraordinary popularity of the Celestial Church of Christ.",304384323,,Dissertations & Theses," Carter, Jeffrey DavidCarterDavidJeffreyCarter, Jeffrey David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739849531 , 27217511 , 66569 , 9780591390308 , 0591390302 , 9729831 , 9729831", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780591390308 , 0591390302", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304384323?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Religious history , Religious congregations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Celestial+Church+of+Christ%3A+Syncretism%2C+ritual+practice+and+the+invention+of+tradition+in+a+new+religious+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carter%2C+Jeffrey+David&amp;isbn=9780591390308&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3553,A proposed North and South Korean education system consolidation plan for a reunified Korean peninsula,"Education is usually viewed as the vehicle that drives a society. The quality of education has a profound effect on how a society is shaped, functions, and prospers. Organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund urge developing third world nations to invest into education for a long term development, because education is an investment that pays the highest dividends over the long run. Education has been an important centerpiece in South Korean society as well. Education, especially the formalized school system, plays a central part in determining a child's future--his or her ability to attain the necessary grades and marks have a bearing on the college that the child will get into, and admission into college, in turn, determines the type of profession and salary that the child will get after graduation. The trend in South Korean education is the overt emphasis put on the formalized school education, especially around the admission and selection process of college, universities, specialized high schools, and academically renowned high school. Anxiety over college entrance is a part of all adolescents' life around the world. However, the emphasis put on it by the society has acutely exacerbated the problem. The exorbitantly long hours that students spend in classroom in preparation for entrance examination, as well as societal and parental pressure, has done much to raise the stress levels of most adolescent students in South Korea, often bringing unwelcomed incidents of student suicide and other conflicts over the issue. Problems such as this is an inherent problem that exists within the South Korean education system. North Korean education system, based on a completely different and opposite ideology, has its sets of problems and issues. Why are the problems associated with both system important? Looking at the recent events that happened around the Korean peninsula, especially the unusual movements by North Korea over the past few years, coupled with the reports of severe and crippling economic hardship that has North Korean population on a brink of mass starvation, a reunification of the Korean peninsula does not sound so abstract and narcissistic. One of the first tasks to be accomplished by the unified Korean government will be the consolidation of the North and South Korean education system. A solid education system will act as a foundation upon with social, economic, and political development can take place. A solid education also goes a long way to stabilize a society. In order to devise a plan for consolidation, both education systems must be looked at detail to identify the differences, similarities, and problems that exist within the systems.

It attributes the cause for this phenomenon to global upheavals of the era, including the struggle for independence from colonialism, the resistance to the Vietnam war and the rise of the women's movement. The female narrators of these novels voice women's righteous indignation against the misogynism of their respective societies as filtered through their personal experiences. Social injunctions against angry women, however, result in the circumspect expression of this emotion. The novels in this study exemplify the traits of the ""Trojan Horse"" metaphor which governs its structure: the motifs of hostile gifting and disguise/enclosure and the techniques of surrogation, displacement and dialogism. Not only do these motifs and techniques function thematically to disclose the narrator's feelings, but they also operate as textual strategies which subvert traditional narrative through repetition, gaps or silences, the resistance to logical syntax, dream imagery, and other challenges to the reader's expectations. In addition to the thematic and textual emphases, this dissertation examines the socio-historical context which informs each work, showing the links between a writer's creative expression and her concerns about the condition of women in her native or adopted country. These narratives thus demonstrate Antonin Artaud's perception of the artist as a scapegoat for the ""roving anger of the times in order to release the people from their psychological dis-ease."" Myriam Warner-Vieyra, a Guadeloupean living in Senegal, and Anne Hebert, a French Canadian, attack the abuses of the institution of marriage in Muslim and Judeo-Christian traditions. Marie Chauvet exposes the gynophobia, racism and classism of Haiti's political and religious systems. Simone de Beauvoir and Monique Wittig reveal the complicity of women in their own subjugation and emphasize the power of communal resistance. Wittig also details language's role in perpetuating patriarchal ideology. Female anger in these texts emerges from society's inhumanity and proposes an egalitarian love which will respect our differences and recognize our commonalities.",304389396,,Dissertations & Theses," Lavine, Laurie K.LavineK.LaurieLavine, Laurie K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739609841 , 27245951 , 66569 , 9780591256093 , 0591256096 , 9717443 , 9717443", Dissertation/Thesis, 1997," 9780591256093 , 0591256096", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304389396?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0355 French Canadian literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0355 French Canadian literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0355 French Canadian literature , 0453 Womens studies",," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0355 French Canadian literature , 0453 Womens studies"," Literature , Romance literature , Caribbean literature , French Canadian literature , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Anne Hebert , Chauvet, Marie , France , Guadeloupe , H\'ebert, Anne , Haiti , Marie Chauvet , Monique Wittig , Myriam Warner-Vieyra , Simone de Beauvoir , Warner-Vieyra, Myriam , twentieth century , women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+functions+of+female+anger+in+the+French+and+Francophone+novel+of+the+mid-twentieth+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lavine%2C+Laurie+K.&amp;isbn=9780591256093&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3555,"Sustainable development, urban transport and urban theory: current positions, convergence and contradictions; a case study of transport and environmental policy-making in selected european cities","This thesis aims to explore the tensions that exist between attempts to realise a more sustainable city and the dominant paradigm of economic development. Using transport policy as a focus, (and in particular, the emerging concept of ""car-free cities"" it explores the tensions and contradictions as well as opportunities that exist between this urban environmental agenda and what current urban theory suggests is actually happening to the form and function of Western cities in late-modern society. The thesis uses case-study material from a number of Northern European cities to explore the types of initiatives that are being considered under the car-free city movement and then develops models of radical and conservative sustainable development to categorise the environmental impact of such policies. It then uses an in-depth case-study of transport policy-making within the UK to explore many of the key economic and political forces that may prevent or assist the application of more sustainable transport policies. The main finding of the thesis is that even in municipalities actively claiming to be pursuing a ""Green"" agenda, only a very conservative interpretation of sustainable development is being implemented. This, I conclude, is because of the complexity of the roles and functions of the local state in late-modern society and its heightened role in pursuing local economic development within a global market-place. This has important implications for both the environmental and social impacts of urban transport. The thesis concludes by suggesting how environmental actors may wish to change their agendas to acknowledge and challenge these powerful economic and political forces.",1773283567,,Dissertations & Theses," McKenzie, CatherineMcKenzieCatherineMcKenzie, Catherine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3984032031 , 44697361 , 101309 , U111722 , U111722", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1773283567?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIU111722 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustainable+development%2C+urban+transport+and+urban+theory%3A+current+positions%2C+convergence+and+contradictions%3B+a+case+study+of+transport+and+environmental+policy-making+in+selected+european+cities&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKenzie%2C+Catherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3556,Personality traits and national dilemma: psychological perspectives of attitudes toward the peace process in the middle east,"The general hypothesis that there are common dispositional personality traits that relate to individuals' attitudinal systems concerning a national dilemma was examined in a sample of 197 Israeli students. The specific research question was why do some people support the Peace Process in the Middle East while others do not. Since there is as yet relatively little published research examining personality traits as related to peace attitudes and membership in political movements, such a focus is considered to contribute to the field of personality psychology as well as to that of peace research, conflict resolution and international relationships. The basic assumption ofvarious statements that relate mental disorders to membership in political movements is that personality traits are drawn upon, transformed and used by the movements to guide their activities, and to articulate their aims and values. Such statements form the stimulus field ofthe present research, examining the challenging puzzle ofwhich configuration ofpersonality traits, characterizes the ""Pro-Peace Personality"". A multi-methodological approach, integrating self-rating scales (the four factors of the General Survey, GS, and the Big Five Inventory, BFI) and the Rorschach (examined on a sub-sample of26 subjects) has been suggested for the empirical examination of personality traits. The Pro-Peace Attitudes Index, PPAI, has been developed for investigating the attitudinal system. The results point to the existence of a ""Pro-Peace Personality"" that tends to be non-religious, less authoritarian conformist, more agreeable and unconventional, high on integrative complexity in psychological 3 functioning, high in awareness to drives and impulses, less intensively reacting to affective stimuli, and high in open-mindedness and creativity. A question is raised as to whether the results can be replicated on other groups ofthe Jewish Israeli population, on the Israeli Arab population, on the Arab countries' population and the Palestinians, as well as on other nations involved in political conflicts, such as within Northern Ireland. Generally, the research might be considered as bridging the gap between the micro and macro levels ofanalysis in social sciences by examining a problem in the field of international relations with concepts and tools of clinical psychology.",1779210975,,Dissertations & Theses," Tibon, ShiraTibonShiraTibon, Shira", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013052641 , 103022832 , 101309 , 10076721 , 10076721", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779210975?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10076721 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Personality+traits+and+national+dilemma%3A+psychological+perspectives+of+attitudes+toward+the+peace+process+in+the+middle+east&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tibon%2C+Shira&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3557,Signs of blackness: racialized governmentality and the politics of the black diaspora (BL),"My intention in this thesis is to provide a critical exposition of how a Diasporic theory of Black politics in modernity might be conceived using the methodological tools of deconstruction . In this context the orchestrating concept of the Black Diaspora is particularly important for two main reasons. Firstly, I argue it can be used to signify a dialogical formation and transnational cartography. This is composed of dispersed and different identities, conditions, cultures and politics, among affiliations of African descent in Europe, the United States, the Caribbean and Africa. Secondly, I argue that as a configurable relation it has conceptual properties that suggest a deconstructive structure insofar as it introduces an irrepressible array of instability and contestability into the modern political settlements of western culture. The thesis develops this idea partly through an illustrative critique of western culture's disavowal of its indebtedness to the governmental structure of racism. In my view this disavowal is entangled with the space of inscription in which the genealogy of the Black Diaspora emerges as an unthematized formation of the politics of modernity, concerned with the exposure and redress of the effects both of racialization/racism and its European disavowal. Consequently I argue not only that Black politics is one of the oldest social and Diasporic movements in the history of modernity but that the racism of European modernity has been invariably instituted through extended and differential forms of governance. I also suggest that European racism should be understood as the initialization of a political theory. The thesis is divided into two sections. The first section, Deconstructing Formations of Racism , proceeds from W.E.B. Du Bios's famous observation in 1903 (that the problem of the 20 th century is the problem of the colour line). The second section, Genealogy of the Black Diaspora , brings together the themes of the previous section as a basis for analysing the political and cultural challenges of the dispersal of Black identities and movements to the naturalization of modernity's racisms and devaluation of African mores, ancestry and antiquity.",301504125,,Dissertations & Theses," Hesse, B.HesseB.Hesse, B.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757813851 , 44704581 , 101309 , U099603 , U099603", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301504125?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU099603 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Signs+of+blackness%3A+racialized+governmentality+and+the+politics+of+the+black+diaspora+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hesse%2C+B.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3558,Diaspora politics: the case of immigrants and refugees from Turkey residing in Germany since 1980 (BL),"This study examines Turkish immigrants and refugees in Germany within their contexts as diasporas in order to analyse the scope of their homeland political affiliations and the political implications of these at national and international level. Chapter 1 introduces the main hypotheses and arguments and places the thesis within the literature on diaspora and immigrant politics. The theoretical tools that structure the analysis of the thesis are discussed in chapter 2 , with a particular emphasis on both anthropological and international relations theories of transnationalism, theories of political participation, and concepts drawn from the scholarship on diaspora-politics. Chapters 3 and 4 are background chapters first outlining Turkish-German relations with a particular emphasis on post-1980 developments, followed by a discussion of the legal, economic, and social status of Turkish citizens in Germany. Chapter 5 presents the scope and levels of the diasporas' political mobilization in relation to their homeland. The complex landscape of the political organizations is viewed in the perspective of the institutionalized representation of the various overlapping political, ethnic and religious movements within the diasporas. Chapters 6 and 7 analyse the diasporas' participation in the political institutions of the host-country. This participation takes the form of multilayered strategies including both 'confrontational' and 'institutional' participation. In general terms, German political institutions view such homeland political activities with reservation. Yet a situation of spatial diffusion of Turkish and German domestic politics have been the consequence of a development where homeland political agendas have become part of a differentiated pattern of dialogue between parts of the diasporas and host-state political actors sympathetic to their particular agenda. Chapter 8 explores the perception and agency of the homeland, Turkey, which views diasporas as an ambiguous asset. Citizens abroad may constitute a potential lobby on the behalf of Turkish interests, but at the same time there is also concern with the political dissidence unfolding with a basis in Germany. Chapter 9 comments on the conclusions and perspectives to be drawn from the preceding analysis and argues for further and extended studies of the phenomenon of diaspora politics in a western European context.",301515901,,Dissertations & Theses," Ostergaard-Nielsen, E.K.Ostergaard-NielsenE.K.Ostergaard-Nielsen, E.K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757813381 , 44704481 , 101309 , U117324 , U117324", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301515901?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU117324 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Diaspora+politics%3A++the+case+of+immigrants+and+refugees+from+Turkey+residing+in+Germany+since+1980+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ostergaard-Nielsen%2C+E.K.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3559,Islamic resurgence in the periphery: a study of political islam in contemporary malaysia with special reference to the darul arqam movement 1968-1996,"As a case-study, this thesis investigates the political challenge posed by Darul Arqam, an Islamic movement, to the Malaysian state from 1968 until 1996. As a general manifestation of Islamic resurgence, the challenge sheds light on three important issues: the tactics, methods and strategies pursued by Islamic movements; the secular authorities' pattern of response to Islamic movements; the impact of repression on Islamists. The Darul Arqam challenge was unique in dispensing with conventional Islaniist ideas and practices, in generating an atypical reaction from the state and in producing an unconventional counter-response to state-initiated suppression. Darul Arqam's roots are traced to Malaysian Islam's largely sufi inclinations, which have been neglected by most contemporary Islamists for their perceived disadvantages, but which Darul Arqam successfully harnessed to its benefit. Given Darn! Arqam's disavowal of political violence and the state's strategy of emphasising cooptation and accommodation of Islaniists, its full-blown repression of Darul Arqam in 1994 deserves scrutiny in its myriad aspects and implications. The paradox of Darul Arqam's challenge is underlined by its innate capacity to weather external pressure, showing that wholesale repression would not necessarily amount to liquidation of a grassroots movement. - Applying the case-study of Darn! Arqam to wider historical and situational seftings, this thesis urges a rethinking of issues and concepts of general theoretical and practical significance. Malaysia and Darni Arqam are contextually situated within the Islamic periphery: a subject area which has eluded the serious attention of scholars intent on unearthing the phenomenon of Islamic resurgence. Yet, unconventional cases in the periphery, often guided by a pragmatic appreciation of indigenous mores, may be a more appropriate yardstick to gauge the potential of political Islam on account of its inherent grassroots appeal. Within the context of political Islam in Malaysia, this study examines the relative impact of long-term internal structural processes and global developments in moulding the contemporary scenario. Ideologically, the empirical case-study of Darul Arqam as a dynamic movement, combining the theory of sufi-messianic Islam with an achievement-oriented economic ethic, challenges conventional theories which postulate an incompatibility between religion, especially in its otherworldly dimensions, and modernisation, as measured mainly in terms of material development. Darn! Arqam, despite its heavily spiritual inclinations, emerged in the 1990s as an independent economic powerhouse which threatened the status quo of Malaysian politics. It is the successful marriage between apparently contradictory modes of social organisation, arguably unprecedented among contemporary political Islaniists, which underlines Darn! Arqam's distinctiveness and merits as a case-study with global implications.",301520539,,Dissertations & Theses," Hamid, Ahmad Fauzi Bin AbdulHamidFauzi Bin AbdulAhmadHamid, Ahmad Fauzi Bin Abdul", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757925021 , 44727291 , 101309 , U122612 , U122612 , http://hdl.handle.net/10443/328", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301520539?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0318 Religion, Religion," http://hdl.handle.net/10443/328 , (UMI)AAIU122612 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Islamic+resurgence+in+the+periphery%3A+a+study+of+political+islam+in+contemporary+malaysia+with+special+reference+to+the+darul+arqam+movement+1968-1996&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hamid%2C+Ahmad+Fauzi+Bin+Abdul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3560,Shinnyoen and the transmission of japanese new religions abroad,"This study examines the ways and the extent to which Japanese new religions that seek to attain an international presence adapt and alter their techniques of proselytism in moving from one culture to another, and the ways in which their development varies in non-Japanese cultures. In particular I focus on Shinnyoen, one of the largest new religions in Japan, which has achieved a foothold in Hawaii and other areas with large Japanese immigrant populations, but which has also begun to develop in Europe and other parts of Asia. Currently, movements such as Shinnyoen are in their infancy in Britain, although they have already begun to establish a presence and have developed to some degree beyond the Japanese population. Accordingly, the activities of such religious groups and the ways in which they seek to appeal to and attract non-Japanese followers form a highly appropriate topic for research. This study will examine Shinnyoen and its proselytizing campaign in three diverse locations - the UK, Hawaii, and Singapore - in order to glean a clear account of the dynamics involved in the proselytizing activities of Japanese new religions overseas. The ethos of Japanese new religious movements and the conditions (social, organizational, cultural) conducive for dissemination abroad, especially among local populations, are issues explored in the process. The extent to which these patterns differ at the various locations will also be examined in order to determine whether Shinnyoen attracts, and targets, the same type of people in Britain as it does in Singapore and Hawaii. What will emerge at the conclusion of this study is a clearer picture of the challenges Japanese new religions face in their efforts to expand overseas and flourish in foreign soil and the necessary provisions they must possess in their praxis and organizational structure if they are to meet these challenges.",301525147,,Dissertations & Theses," Sakashita, JaySakashitaJaySakashita, Jay", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757925071 , 44727331 , 101309 , U114895 , U114895 , http://hdl.handle.net/1893/2264", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301525147?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0318 Religion, Religion," http://hdl.handle.net/1893/2264 , (UMI)AAIU114895 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Shinnyoen+and+the+transmission+of+japanese+new+religions+abroad&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sakashita%2C+Jay&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3561,"The arpillera movement in Chile, 1974-1996 (BL)","This thesis presents an analysis of the 'arpillera world', the network of people co-operating to make, distribute and sell arpilleras (denunciatory wall hangings made by victims of political repression and economic deprivation in Chile). It adds to Becker's (1982) theory of 'art worlds' a political dimension, which has two components: (1) national and international political and economic contexts impact both artworks and art worlds, and (2) collective artistic activity in a context of political repression can foster a political consciousness in the artists. Art, it finds, is an important but understudied part of political movements, serving to inform, arouse, and shape the beliefs of diverse sets of movement actors. The arpilleras provided their 'consumers' (Chilean exiles and human rights activists in Europe and North America) with information about the state of affairs in Chile, and helped arouse in them the desire to oust Pinochet. The collective making of arpilleras caused the radicalisation of the shantytown women who made them. The thesis also constructs a chronology of the arpillera. It examines changes over time in the arpillera (from denunciatory to bucolic) and distribution system (from solidarity-oriented to commercially oriented), in the light of anthropological and sociological theories of change in art forms. it links the sociology of art and social movements literatures by demonstrating how changes in art worlds can cause changes in levels of activism of the artists/activists. The demand for bucolic arpilleras was partly responsible for the de-radicalisation of the shantytown women who made them. Finally, the thesis suggests that reciprocity in the fieldwork context can cause problems for the researcher because of the researcher's ever-changing membership status in the group she studies, and because of differences (in culture, power, and knowledge) between herself and her subjects.

In particular, it examines the ways in which these parties have dealt with the very specific issue of the 'Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe' (CSCE), both in government and opposition, from 1966 to 1983. It analyses the internal, domestic and international factors which have influenced these debates. The thesis provides a bridge between the works of Clayton Clemens on the Union's adaptation to 'Ostpolitik' and Tim Matthias Weber's work on Christian Democratic Nuclear Weapons Policy. The thesis demonstrates that, with respect to the CSCE, a tripolar debate evolved within the Christian Democratic parties. 'Fundamentalists' in the CSU and the right wing of the CDU were opposed to the entire idea of CSCE, which they argued could only lead to the reinforcement of the division of Germany. 'Rationalists' in the leadership of the CDU and the Fraktion were much more muted in their opposition to the proposals and attempted on numerous occasions to use the CSCE to forge a foreign policy consensus with the Federal Government. While the early debates within the CDU/CSU were dominated by the 'fundamentalists', the thesis shows that a third stream evolved which the left wing of the Fraktion and the Youth and student movements, referred to as 'positivists'. These actively demanded the embracing of the CSCE principles by the Union, particularly those on human rights. An emerging consensus about the CSCE between the major parties was reflected in the critical 'Grosse Anfrage' debate of October 1974. The parliamentary rejection of the Final Act was therefore only a Pyrrhic victory for the 'fundamentalists'. Throughout the later 1970s and early 1980s, the Union pursued a 'rationalist-positivist' CSCE policy, focusing on the humanitarian Basket III and the formulation of the 'German Question' (the problem of unification) as an issue of human rights, during the follow-up meetings at Belgrade and Madrid. This was both a reaction to the change of American foreign policy by President Carter, and part of an electoral strategy by CDU chairman Helmut Kohl, to woo the Free Democrats out of the Coalition with the SPD. Overall, the thesis demonstrated that the CSCE process was more important to CDU/CSU than has hitherto been imagined.",301560491,,Dissertations & Theses," Walter, R.WalterR.Walter, R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757814451 , 44704741 , 101309 , U115297 , U115297", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301560491?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," (UMI)AAIU115297 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+CDU%2FCSU+and+its+debates+about+the+%27Conference+for+Security+and+Co-operation+in+Europe%27+%28CSCE%29+between+1966+and+1983.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walter%2C+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3563,"Nearly the New World: refugees and the British West Indies, 1933-1945 (BL)","This thesis examines the role of the Caribbean as a place of refuge, internment and transit for Jewish refugees from Europe during the interwar and Second World War period. It approaches the subject from the different perspectives of the British Government, West Indian colonies, refugee organisations and refugees themselves. It is divided into three parts, the first examining local, national and international concerns of the British Government towards its colonies in the Caribbean. It explores how these concerns impacted on the development of immigration policy in the British West Indies, and how the Colonial Office managed to steer a course between protecting West Indian interests and following Government directives over its refugee policy. The second section traces the vital role played by British, American and European Jewish refugee organisations. It explores their practical involvement in directing refugees to the West Indies, in negotiating entry for refugees with invalid travel documents, and in providing maintenance. It also explores how the West Indies took on greater significance for refugee bodies as the war progressed. Whilst concentrating on their involvement with the West Indies, this section analyses the achievements and limitations facing voluntary refugee bodies during this period. The last section of this thesis considers the movement of refugees to the British West Indies, analysing how much choice was involved in their destination. Particular attention is paid to the experience of internment and attempts to establish Jewish communities. The reactions of British West Indians to the question of Jewish immigration, and to the presence of Jewish refugees is explored within the context of the social, political and economic situation of the British West Indies in the 1930s and 1940s.",301621741,,Dissertations & Theses," Newman, J.NewmanJ.Newman, J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757808541 , 44703021 , 101309 , U103236 , U103236 , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/43757/", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301621741?accountid=14496, 0582 Modern history, 0582 Modern history, 0582 Modern history,, 0582 Modern history, Modern history," http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/43757/ , (UMI)AAIU103236 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nearly+the+New+World%3A+refugees+and+the+British+West+Indies%2C+1933-1945+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Newman%2C+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3564,The strings of the Gandharva's lute: Continuity and change in the cross-societal transmission of Tibetan Buddhist ritual,"What is it that permits a society of individuals, whether geographically or ideologically based, to recognize elements of practical and ideological continuity in the face of change? Often wide variations in actual social practices linked to ethnic, religious, or national identity are regarded as continuous with historical practices, while, at other times, sets of activities which clearly share a common history are marked as discontinuous, generally as a result of some political or ideological factor which is considered to have exceeded the bounds of inclusivity. To the degree that religion functions as a marker of identity at both the local and global level, as well as the fact that anthropologists regard ritual as a performed enactment of religious, hence social, ideology, this dissertation considers the issue of continuity and change in relationship to the cross-societal transmission of religious ritual. More specifically, this dissertation considers the contemporary transmission of Tibetan Buddhist ritual to Euro-American practitioners in the United States. Within the over-all discussion, three general topics are addressed: (1) a consideration of structural and performative elements of contemporary Tibetan Buddhist ritual which suggests historical continuity with other contemporary ritual forms that similarly trace their ancestry back to pre-Common Era Indic ritual practices; (2) a consideration of the flexibility mechanisms which facilitate certain types of variation within the performance of contemporary Tibetan ritual in order to determine some of the indigenously-ascribed boundaries between permissible (i.e. continuative) and non-acceptable variation, with an eye to adaptations that are being made in present-day cross-societal transmission; and (3) a consideration of the intellectual history that has helped shape receptivity and adaptive response to Tibetan ritual in the United States. Additionally, two more subsidiary topics are addressed: (1) boundaries of continuity and discontinuity located in contemporary reframings of Tibetan ritual performance; and (2) the impact of the development of new models for cross-societal transmission on transmission of and receptivity to Tibetan Buddhist ritual in certain indigenous areas. This examination suggests that a determination of the parameters between continuity and discontinuity within ritual performance needs to be considered at three different levels of operation. Following the Tibetan Buddhist model of ""outer"", ""inner"", and ""secret"" (PHyi, Nang, gSang) modes of valuation, continuities and discontinuities of ritual performance can be seen located in terms of (1) ""external"" performative components such as text, structure, music, and movement, (2) ""internal"" ideological reshapings of meaning, and (3) ""esoteric"" function, i.e. ritual efficacy. In the process of cross-societal transmission of religion, adaptability in any or all of these areas may need to occur in order to facilitate receptivity among new populations. To the degree that certain core valuations within each of these three arenas are maintained, continuity may or may not be recognized.",304420174,,Dissertations & Theses," Egert, Janine EveEgertEveJanineEgert, Janine Eve", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732934421 , 28578911 , 66569 , 9780591991703 , 0591991705 , 9902061 , 9902061", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591991703 , 0591991705", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304420174?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0318 Religion"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0318 Religion"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0318 Religion",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0318 Religion"," Cultural anthropology , Music , Religion"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Buddhism , Cross-societal transmission , Gandharva , Ritual , Societal transmission , Tibetan Buddhist",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+strings+of+the+Gandharva%27s+lute%3A+Continuity+and+change+in+the+cross-societal+transmission+of+Tibetan+Buddhist+ritual&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Egert%2C+Janine+Eve&amp;isbn=9780591991703&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3565,"Hermann Muthesius and the reform of German architecture, arts, and crafts, 1890-1914","This dissertation reexamines the origins of German modernism in architecture and the applied arts through the multi-faceted career of Hermann Muthesius (1861–1927), a leading Berlin architect and theoretician of the early twentieth-century. Working at the crossroads of the design and government policy professions, Muthesius enjoyed an unusually prolific career as an architect, writer, diplomatic attaché, Prussian government servant, and reformer of arts and crafts education. Muthesius's professional activities brought him into close contact with Prussian state power, a Wilhelmine architectural and artistic vanguard, and leading national organizations focusing on economic development. From this unique position the architect exercised a formative influence on Germany's approach to twentieth-century architecture, the applied arts, and the application of design to industry. Working in Japan, Germany, and England between 1888 and 1903, Muthesius, became known for reinterpreting the principles of the British Arts and Crafts movement in light of contemporary German economic, cultural, and technological conditions. Assigned to report to his government on English cultural, economic, and technical affairs from London's German Embassy between 1896 and 1903, he authored countless articles, reports, and such well-known books as Stilarchitektur and Baukunst of 1902 and his three-volume landmark study, Das englische Haus of 1904–05. Returning to a post at the Prussian Ministry of Commerce and Trade in Berlin in 1903, he applied lessons derived from Britain to reform more than three dozen Prussian state schools of applied arts, crafts, and trades for service to a modern economy. In dozens of buildings and more than 100 articles and books published before World War I, Muthesius was responsible for the theories that laid the basis for the Deutscher Werkbund as well as the Bauhaus. The dissertation moves outward from Muthesius's multi-faceted career to combine the methodologies of political, social, and architectural history. It identifies new historical ties between the Prussian state's economic development efforts, a design culture increasingly oriented toward the Kaiserreich's fast-paced industrial and commercial expansion, and government policies toward the trades and service classes that comprised Germany's Mittelstand . Comparative analysis of governmental and non-governmental sources reveals that Prussian state policies—the goal of which was to improve German production quality and boost international competitiveness—played a fundamental role in the emergence of modern German design culture. The study emphasizes the years between 1903 and 1914, when Muthesius developed applied arts reforms for his government, founded a private architectural practice, and formulated the main principles that led to the formation of the Deutscher Werkbund. His efforts simultaneously advanced the interests of the educated, upper-middle class Bürgertum , which he joined from Mittelstand roots, while realizing the state's goals of improving the quality of German production and exports. In the increasingly fractious pre-war Wilhelmine political and cultural environment, his actions provoked such notable controversies as the Werkbund debates of 1914. Nevertheless, his formulation of such objective design principles as Sachlichkeit and Zweckmässigkeit (functionalism), his advocacy of architecture and design as forces for social engineering and cultural renewal, and his conviction that new technology held the key to socially conscious contemporary design all outlasted the Kaiserreich to become a part of the twentieth century's design lexicon. The history of twentieth-century modern German architecture and design, this dissertation argues, cannot properly be understood without examining the full scope of its Wilhelmine roots.",304423538,,Dissertations & Theses," Maciuika, John VincentMaciuikaVincentJohnMaciuika, John Vincent", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 734424541 , 28579631 , 66569 , 9780599225206 , 0599225203 , 9922950 , 9922950", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780599225206 , 0599225203", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304423538?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0377 Art History , 0335 European history"," 0729 Architecture , 0377 Art History , 0335 European history"," 0729 Architecture , 0377 Art History , 0335 European history",," 0729 Architecture , 0377 Art History , 0335 European history"," Architecture , Art History , European history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Architecture , Arts , Crafts , German , Muthesius, Hermann , Reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hermann+Muthesius+and+the+reform+of+German+architecture%2C+arts%2C+and+crafts%2C+1890-1914&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maciuika%2C+John+Vincent&amp;isbn=9780599225206&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3566,"Contesting reproduction: Gender, the state and reproductive technologies in India","This dissertation is a narrative of Indian women's experience with intervention in their reproduction. This intervention ranges from birth control during the colonial period, to assigned reproductive responsibilities during the nationalist struggle, to population control in post-colonial India, to bearing male children for the patriarchal family, to name but a few. This dissertation demonstrates that in India, women's reproduction is linked to the interests of the nation,, the states, international agencies and the patriarchal families which control women's reproduction. The underlying argument is that the conflation of economic development and population numbers fundamentally alters how women's reproduction is viewed in India. The Indian state sees population growth as a threat to the social and economic order and, because it declares the achievement of ‘development’ as the basis of its own right to rule, it supports patriarchal control of reproduction despite political and constitutional commitments to gender equality. State policies of population control articulate at various historical junctures with local patriarchal practices which as a result acquire new forms. In this process the Indian state is assisted by Western states and international agencies. This dissertation also demonstrates that reproductive technologies, which many women in the West welcomed as a “defining moment in history”, and as liberating and empowering, meant more state and patriarchal control for women in the ‘Third World’. It argues that whether reproductive choice through reproductive technologies is empowering or disempowering is decided in the realm of the politics of reproduction—in the discursive and institutional practices in which reproduction is represented and new threats (of population explosion, for example) and new roles are identified and contested. This dissertation shows how women in India are organizing against coercive practices of population control which are pushed by states and agencies in the name of reproductive freedom and choice'. In multiple activities and complex practices women are building a movement for gender-just reproductive rights where women's bodily integrity and women's own control over their reproduction and life-situations are central to this politics.",304424451,,Dissertations & Theses," Singh, NavsharanSinghNavsharanSingh, Navsharan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 734481351 , 29399181 , 66569 , 9780612370555 , 0612370550 , NQ37055 , NQ37055", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780612370555 , 0612370550", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304424451?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0332 History"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0332 History"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0332 History",," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0332 History"," Womens studies , Social structure , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology , Political science , History"," Social sciences , Colonial , Gender , India , Postcolonial , Reproductive technologies , State",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+reproduction%3A+Gender%2C+the+state+and+reproductive+technologies+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Singh%2C+Navsharan&amp;isbn=9780612370555&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3567,"Managing risk through migration: Marriage, divorce, and childbearing of female Mexican and Central American migrants to the United States","Women make up a considerable percentage of migrants to the United States. Young single women from Mexico and Central America are becoming more important in the flow of migrants from those regions. Nevertheless, most migration research treats female migration as derivative of male migration. This study shows why female migration is often not derivative of male migration, and describes why previous research has led us to faulty conclusions. Most sending-country survey data depend on the household head to document the border crossings of the household members, and I demonstrate how this leads to the underestimation of numbers of immigrating women, and particularly underestimates of the movement of unmarried women (both single and divorced). To overcome this problem, this study uses a U.S.-drawn sample of female migrants. Using the retrospective marital and fertility histories of the June 1990 and 1995 Current Population Survey, I show that there are strong temporal connections between women's international migration and other life-course events, namely marriage, divorce, and first births. Proportional hazards estimation reveals that single Mexican and Central American-born women have much higher chances of first marriage during the year in which they migrate, as well as for seven years after migration, than they do prior to migration. Chances for first divorce are higher immediately before and after migration thin they are long before migration. Among Mexican and Central American-born women, chances for non-marital first births are higher in the period preceding migration than they are earlier. For all migrant women, chances for non-marital births are higher after migration than they are before migration. All of these findings suggest that women are not simply following male migrants to the U.S., nor do their decisions to move appear to be based solely on the economic conditions that have been used to explain male migration. Women may move in order to secure a better quality of life for themselves and their children that includes not only access to higher wages, but also access to marriage markets, access to divorce, and to escape from restrictive social environments. For some women, their expected quality of life is better in the destination country. For others, there may be less variation in outcomes and their decision to move may demonstrate a preference to avoid risk.",304427387,,Dissertations & Theses," Hill, Laura ElizabethHillElizabethLauraHill, Laura Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 734424171 , 28891261 , 66569 , 9780599224421 , 0599224428 , 9922871 , 9922871", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780599224421 , 0599224428", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304427387?accountid=14496," 0938 Demographics , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0938 Demographics , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0938 Demographics , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0938 Demographics , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Demographics , Womens studies , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Families & family life , Personal relationships"," Social sciences , Central American , Childbearing , Divorce , Immigrants , Marriage , Mexican , Migration , Risk , United States , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Managing+risk+through+migration%3A+Marriage%2C+divorce%2C+and+childbearing+of+female+Mexican+and+Central+American+migrants+to+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hill%2C+Laura+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780599224421&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3568,"Economic restructuring under structural adjustment in Zimbabwe: Deindustrialization in the textile, clothing and footwear industries","Since the early 1980s most of Sub-Saharan Africa has been engaged in programs of economic liberalization, termed ""structural adjustment"", sponsored by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In the literature there has been an inconclusive debate about the impacts of structural adjustment on manufacturing development in Africa. This thesis examines the impacts structural adjustment on the development of Zimbabwe's textile, clothing and footwear industries. With a stable macro-economy, a good infrastructure and a developed manufacturing base, Zimbabwe was meant to be favorably positioned to pursue structural adjustment, beginning in 1990. The labor-intensive and export-oriented textile, clothing and footwear were predicted to grow especially rapidly once the economy was liberalized, however, in actuality they collapsed. Using survey returns and data from interviews with a variety of institutions and with firm managers, this thesis explains the collapse of the study industries by reference to the impacts of exchange rate, trade and financial sector liberalization, inflows of second hand clothing and the effects of falling real wages on workers' motivation. The traditional economic theory on which structural adjustment policies are based ignores the spatially embedded nature of development and consequently the results of reform have been much different from those anticipated. Where technological capabilities are weak, foreign investment is scarce, and the economic structure tends towards macro-economic instability, economic liberalization results in the autonomous development of the trade and financial sectors to the detriment of production. It is argued that economic liberalization in the Third World is fundamentally conditioned by restructuring in the First, particularly the slow-down in economic growth during the 1970s and the consequent necessity of opening markets globally. Africa's social and economic decline will only be reversed by movements for participatory democracy or by hard states capable of effectively regulating trade and finance, and disciplining domestic capital to meet export targets and to upgrade its capabilities.",304436300,,Dissertations & Theses," Carmody, Padraig RisteardCarmodyRisteardPadraigCarmody, Padraig Risteard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732879151 , 28608241 , 66569 , 9780591923353 , 0591923351 , 9838623 , 9838623", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591923353 , 0591923351", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304436300?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0505 Business costs , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0505 Business costs , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0505 Business costs , 0700 Social structure",," 0366 Geography , 0505 Business costs , 0700 Social structure"," Geography , Business costs , Social structure"," Social sciences , Clothing industry , Deindustrialization , Economic restructuring , Footwear industry , Industries , Structural adjustment , Textile industry , Zimbabwe",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Economic+restructuring+under+structural+adjustment+in+Zimbabwe%3A+Deindustrialization+in+the+textile%2C+clothing+and+footwear+industries&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carmody%2C+Padraig+Risteard&amp;isbn=9780591923353&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3569,"Undermining landscape, gender and indigenous peoples in contemporary North American Great Plains literature","My interdisciplinary study focuses on the imaginative construction of the Great Plains in the region's contemporary literature. The term colonial imagination first arrived on the Great Plains without an adequate paradigm to describe the region or the experience. European explorers and settlers described the region as a desert, until more fertile lands had been largely claimed, at which time the Great Plains are described as a virgin garden. The majority of regional descriptors have fallen into one or the other of these inadequate paradigms. Both paradigms of desert and garden carry set interpretations--of environment, women and Indigenous People. These paradigms treat all three as aspects of the region to be colonized, which is manifested in a Subject-Object relationship. These Great Plains paradigms have been discussed individually in several critical, historical, and literary studies of the region. However, we find ourselves on the brink of a new millennium, and extensive sedentary habitation has proven that European conceptual models are not particularly useful here. Given current searches for sustainability and the revamping of political and social models, are fiction writers and filmmakers leading a re-visioning of the Great Plains? If so, are they undermining a colonial patriarchy, or are they maintaining their predecessors' failed value systems? My dissertation addresses the following questions: How do landscape and Indigenous peoples and women figure within each author's imaginative construction? Do writers of various backgrounds construct these paradigms differently? If we envision these constructions as a continuum, with the left side marked by previous European conceptions, how does the continuum shift at the close of the twentieth century? What demarcates movement toward the right? To what degree are the environment, Indigenous peoples, and women imaginatively constructed as colonial ground? And, how do imagined characters in texts relate to the global theme of colonization and recovery from colonization? How these recent authors--Henry Kreisel, Larry McMurtry, and Director Martin Ritt--imagine the Great Plains says much about the state of the North American imagination and imaginative culture. It is my hope that a new paradigm for construction of human relationship as a gendered function of environment is being created in this place.",304436815,,Dissertations & Theses," Spaulding, Lisa MarieSpauldingMarieLisaSpaulding, Lisa Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732816281 , 28584411 , 66569 , 9780599001442 , 0599001445 , 9902976 , 9902976", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780599001442 , 0599001445", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304436815?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature",," 0298 Literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature"," Literature , Canadian literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Gender , Great Plains , Henry Kreisel , Indigenous , Kreisel, Henry , Landscape , Larry McMurtry , Martin Ritt , McMurtry, Larry , North American , Ritt, Martin",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Undermining+landscape%2C+gender+and+indigenous+peoples+in+contemporary+North+American+Great+Plains+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Spaulding%2C+Lisa+Marie&amp;isbn=9780599001442&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3570,"The musical society community bands of Valencia, Spain: A global study of their administration, instrumentation, repertoire and performance activities","The present study describes the contemporary community band movement in the autonomous region of Spain known as the Comunidad Valenciana, of which Valencia is the capital city. It is the result of a research project conducted between 1993 and 1995 that was made possible by a grant from the Fulbright Program of the United States Information Agency. The bands of this study are fostered by a local socio-cultural organization called a musical society. There are 433 such musical societies with bands in Valencia. More than two-thirds of all municipalities have musical societies, with 10% of them having more than one. The membership of the musical societies is comprised of musicians and non-musicians and frequently comprises a sizable percentage of a town's population. The musical society sponsors bands and other ensembles, provides music education and serves as a social center. The bands observed range in size from 35 to 178, with an average of 61 musicians. They are also supported by the Valencian Federation of Musical Societies, all branches of government, the business community and the media. The band's instrumentation often features a wide range and number of saxophones and includes string instruments such as cellos and string basses. The flugelhorn, euphonium and English horn are used most frequently as solo color instruments. The symphonic repertoire performed includes orchestral and zarzuela transcriptions as well as original compositions by local and foreign band composers. The marching repertoire includes bullfight, regional, sentat, dianero and concert forms of pasodobles; processional, military, Moorish, Christian and concert forms of marches; and anthems. The band's non-competitive performance activities include concerts, band festivals, honor bands and massed bands. Band contests are sponsored at the municipal, provincial, regional and international levels. Many of these performance types are combined for special celebrations like patron saint holidays, Las Fallas and Moros y Cristianos. Much remains to be studied about other regional and national trends of band activity in Spain. Although the musical society bands of Valencia constantly face new challenges, their integration into the social and cultural fabrics of their communities bodes well for their continued prosperity.",304440793,,Dissertations & Theses," Cohen, Richard ScottCohenScottRichardCohen, Richard Scott", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 737018671 , 28338721 , 66569 , 9780591791112 , 0591791110 , 9826737 , 9826737", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591791112 , 0591791110", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304440793?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0700 Social structure , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0413 Music , 0700 Social structure , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0413 Music , 0700 Social structure , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0413 Music , 0700 Social structure , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Music , Social structure , Cultural anthropology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , bands",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+musical+society+community+bands+of+Valencia%2C+Spain%3A+A+global+study+of+their+administration%2C+instrumentation%2C+repertoire+and+performance+activities&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cohen%2C+Richard+Scott&amp;isbn=9780591791112&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3571,"Insurgent health, low-intensity medicine: Containing the threat of grassroots development in El Salvador","This is a study of the role that grassroots health development work played in shaping and signifying power relations between a militaristic state and a dissident peasant population during and in the aftermath of civil war. My thesis is that grassroots development work in this rural province was viewed as a threat in its own right by Salvadoran authorities, and that the U.S. government assisted with tactics used to undermine this work. In Part One I use the existential dialectic of ""Healing and Terror"" to (1) look at the role of state coercion in marginalizing the Chalateco peasantry; and I examine the cultural and political polarization that this ""systemic violence"" has created. (2) I then use an anthropology of the body to explore the impact of living in a culture of terror on peasant consciousness, arguing that an analysis of tacit social practices and discourses of the peasantry shows that coercion plays an important role in the cultural hegemony of a militarized state. (3) I then reconstruct the history of state repression against Chalatenango's dissident peasant movement during the late 1970s, and the role of this repression in spurring the peasant rebellion. (4) I then examine the central role played by health workers in community-building survival practices adopted by Chalateco peasants during the many years they spent cut off from the rest of the country, in a war zone, in exile, and in a mass repopulation of villages located in rebel-controlled territory. In Part Two I examine the state's efforts to manipulate symbolism of health and medicine to shore up the nationalist project. I present a body of evidence showing that rural health work was regarded by the government as a target in low-intensity conflict, and I examine the government's use of medical symbolism ""psychological warfare."" In Part Three I examine the role of ""popular"" health development in the repopulated Chalatenango communities as a form of social healing, arguing that this community-based approach to health, based on local lay providers, was a powerful critique of state rural health programs, which was accomplishing many goals of ""community participation,"" a component of international health development programs that has proven elusive in many settings. In Part Four I look at the (partically successful) efforts of the government to coopt the popular health system during the first four years of the peace process (1992-95), and I show that there was clear political motivation from high levels of the Ministry of Health to undermine community health approaches, both in this ex-war zone, and in other areas of the country where health work involved organizing community support.",304440873,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith-Nonini, Sandra CarolSmith-NoniniCarolSandraSmith-Nonini, Sandra Carol", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732886021 , 28585171 , 66569 , 9780591949353 , 0591949350 , 9840994 , 9840994", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591949353 , 0591949350", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304440873?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Public health"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , El Salvador , Grassroots , Health development , Insurgent , Medicine , Peasantry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Insurgent+health%2C+low-intensity+medicine%3A+Containing+the+threat+of+grassroots+development+in+El+Salvador&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith-Nonini%2C+Sandra+Carol&amp;isbn=9780591949353&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3572,"Loyalist to liberal: The reform persuasion in New Brunswick politics, 1837-1857","In the British colony of New Brunswick, the period from 1837 to 1857 was one of intense political reform. The reform movement which eventually produced Responsible Government was the creation of a small group of men who were participants in an Anglo-American political discourse stretching back to the seventeenth-century. Those men consciously drew on the ideas and values of transatlantic political culture to fashion their own political persuasion. That persuasion, best reflected in the public rhetoric of the reformers, represented a middle path between British and American traditions, as well as between liberal and democratic ideals. At the center of the reform persuasion was a type of constitutional liberalism incorporating principles of autonomy, popular sovereignty, social justice and progress. In its international context that type of liberalism was very similar to the liberalism then developing in the other British North American colonies, and had much in common with British liberalism as well as the newly emerging culture of the American Whigs. With roots in classical republican, classical liberal, and Scottish political thought, this persuasion was also strongly influenced by the values of evangelical Protestantism. This study is not however, concerned with roots as much as with the actual conditions of political thought and the ways in which reformers utilized certain ideals and values to resolve the political problems that they faced. New Brunswick's first liberal reformers sought the golden mean between oligarchy and democracy. Their battles were primarily against the entrenched privilege and prerogatives of the family compact, but they were equally wary of excessive of democracy. They saw in Responsible Government the balance they were seeking. Through Responsible Government they eventually gained a substantial measure of autonomy and a more effective and efficient political structure. In addition, reformers successfully battled for reform of the electoral system, religious freedom, educational reform and moral reforms such as temperance. By the time the Confederation debate finally pushed all other political issues to the margins, New Brunswick's liberal reformers had not only substantially reformed the political system but had laid the foundations of a new liberal-democratic political culture. This study is an attempt to understand a part of the history of Canadian political culture, the ideas, attitudes and emotions that are the foundation of the modern Canadian political system.",304442557,,Dissertations & Theses," Lively, Robert JohnLivelyJohnRobertLively, Robert John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733021101 , 29180741 , 66569 , 9780599130401 , 0599130407 , 9914414 , 9914414", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780599130401 , 0599130407", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304442557?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science"," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science"," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science",," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science"," Canadian history , Political science"," Social sciences , Liberalism , New Brunswick , Politics , Reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Loyalist+to+liberal%3A+The+reform+persuasion+in+New+Brunswick+politics%2C+1837-1857&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lively%2C+Robert+John&amp;isbn=9780599130401&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3573,"Sex, violence, citizenship, and community: An ethnography and legal geography of commercial sex in one American city","Scholarly and regulatory treatments of commercial sex have focused overwhelmingly on prostitution, and on individually focused questions regarding sexual deviance, family and psychological history, and gender and sexual agency, applied primarily to the ""provider"" of sexual services. Framing commercial sex against the backdrop of deindustrialization and global capitalism, my dissertation considers both the relationship between macroeconomic forces and the formation of local sex markets, and the everyday life experiences of participants in these sex markets. The dissertation details three central findings, drawing upon archival data and ethnographic field interviews with women involved in street prostitution, escort services, and exotic dancing, along with their customers, affiliates, and local police officers in one Northwestern United States city. First, commercial sex in the city of ""Evergreen"" has developed as an interconnected set of informal markets and practices, which are linked to a broader political economy of labor and consumption, and which reproduce a geography of centrality and marginality. Second, both licit and illicit commercial sex practices take shape not as discrete contractual sex acts or as clearly defined employment relations, but as embodied, copresent, and negotiated interactions that are contingent upon the organization of material, social, and spatial power relations. Finally, commercial sex practices are regulated through conventional legal strategies and through spatial strategies (e.g., the ""Prostitution Free Zone Ordinance"") which play upon popular notions of community and ""neighborhood livability"" to manage the movement and visibility of those suspected of engaging in prostitution in public city spaces. These empirical findings suggest that while commercial sex services can be linked to other forms of marginalized labor as a kind of consumer market and service, the material and sociospatial context, and the embodied, copresent quality of these negotiated interactions heightens the potential for conflict and facilitates the marginalization of female service providers within their communities.",304443175,,Dissertations & Theses," Sanchez, Lisa ErinSanchezErinLisaSanchez, Lisa Erin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 738062691 , 29900901 , 66569 , 9780591901306 , 0591901307 , 9836545 , 9836545", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591901306 , 0591901307", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304443175?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0452 Social work , 0627 Criminology , 0398 Law , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0700 Social structure , 0452 Social work , 0627 Criminology , 0398 Law , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0700 Social structure , 0452 Social work , 0627 Criminology , 0398 Law , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies",," 0700 Social structure , 0452 Social work , 0627 Criminology , 0398 Law , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," Social structure , Social work , Criminology , Law , Cultural anthropology , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Commercial sex , Community , Legal geography , Sex , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sex%2C+violence%2C+citizenship%2C+and+community%3A+An+ethnography+and+legal+geography+of+commercial+sex+in+one+American+city&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sanchez%2C+Lisa+Erin&amp;isbn=9780591901306&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3574,George Edgar Vincent: An intellectual and professional journey through the Progressive Era,"In his close association with two important nineteenth century movements--the Chautauqua system of popular education and academic sociology--Vincent sought to identify the critical core of knowledge which would encourage greater citizen participation in the American democracy. Vincent's lifelong commitment to the Chautauqua movement and his involvement as a doctoral student and young professor in defining sociology as an academic discipline resulted in tensions which mirrored larger intellectual conflicts and compromises between religiously motivated reform efforts and scientifically organized progress. The examination of George Vincent's development both intellectually and professionally centers on four interrelated spheres of activity: popular education, academic sociology, educational reform, and university and foundation administration. Vincent's writings, speeches, and administrative style reveal the patterns of influence which shaped him and through which he shaped the institutions he led. While discovering his role as a principled professional, Vincent moved from sociology professor and dean at the University of Chicago to the presidency of the University of Minnesota and later the Rockefeller Foundation. With a career spanning four decades from 1890 to 1930, Vincent was a part of a group of Progressive intellectuals who promoted scientific methodology and a ""disinterested"" approach in the creation and utilization of knowledge. The new intellectual and institutional forms they established became the mode of operation for the twentieth century. Through his leadership of the Rockefeller Foundation during key years in its transition from a family operation to a more professional organization, George Vincent made a significant contribution in the creation of a framework for social action on the national and international level. Vincent's accommodation in response to the tensions of this era of fundamental change was representative of the struggle of intellectuals to create legitimate roles for themselves based on their expert knowledge. Rooted in a Chautauqua commitment to popular education, Vincent was not satisfied with expert knowledge alone. The distinctiveness of his response was revealed through the delicate balance he employed in managing public opinion to assure the involvement of citizens in confirming the work of experts related to social issues.",304451788,,Dissertations & Theses," Hayes, Rebecca SaundersHayesSaundersRebeccaHayes, Rebecca Saunders", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732884291 , 28898981 , 66569 , 9780591943016 , 0591943018 , 9840421 , 9840421", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591943016 , 0591943018", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304451788?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education , 0337 American history"," 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education , 0337 American history"," 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education , 0337 American history",," 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education , 0337 American history"," Education history , Higher education , American history"," Social sciences , Education , Academic sociology , Chautauqua Institute , Progressive Era , Vincent, George Edgar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=George+Edgar+Vincent%3A+An+intellectual+and+professional+journey+through+the+Progressive+Era&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hayes%2C+Rebecca+Saunders&amp;isbn=9780591943016&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3575,"The politics of Islamists in Algeria, Egypt and the Sudan","This dissertation is a general survey of the major and minor modern Islamic political movements that erupted in the early 1970s and late, 80s and, 90s in three Middle Eastern countries: Egypt, Algeria and Sudan.

The democratization and decolonization movements anchored by minjung (people) transformed Korea, fundamentally reconstituting the identity of the nation and transforming the nature and possibilities of culture, especially the cinema. This dissertation takes as concern the complex and contradictory conditions that frame the New Korean Cinema, investigating the function of cinema and charting its formulation of new cultural identities. The project contends that though both gender and class often appear in clear disjunction with each other in this cinema, the newly mobilized forms of identity strikingly shift the foundation of the nation that was previously considered to be intractable and incontestable. The New Korean Cinema emerged at this critical juncture, occupying a space, left void by the radical polarization of cinema between the mainstream commercial films and the underground films. The dissertation studies many of the pivotal films made during the 10-year period from 1988 to 1997, and analyzes the impetuses, both local and global, that redefined the national cinema. The New Korean Cinema is also contextualized in the films that were made outside the contemporary period as well as the ones produced outside the Korean national context. The films directed by Im Kwon-t'aek (Im Kwon-Taek), Pak Kwang-su (Park Kwang-su), and Chang Sôn-u (Jang Sun-woo) are among those that are discussed. Although the New Korean Cinema's attempt to diversify the local production and to map itself on the global marketplace of art cinema is still an ongoing process, the project considers the attendant themes that construct and characterize this movement as a significant theoretical field. The discourses often raised in both film studies and cultural studies provide the perspectives of each chapter. The discourses of authors, genres, genders, modernity, and nationhood—which comprise the bulk of the organizing principles in film history and theory—are discussed as the project explores the salient modes in which Korean cinema can be discussed in the context of Western scholarship.",304453082,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Kyung HyunKimHyunKyungKim, Kyung Hyun", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 734474981 , 28570251 , 66569 , 9780599306004 , 0599306009 , 9930503 , 9930503", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780599306004 , 0599306009", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304453082?accountid=14496," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0700 Social structure"," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0700 Social structure"," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0700 Social structure",," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0700 Social structure"," Motion Pictures , Social structure"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Cinema , Class , Gender , History , Im Kwon Taek , Jang Sun Woo , Korean , Park Kwang Su",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+new+Korean+cinema%3A+Framing+the+shifting+boundaries+of+history%2C+class%2C+and+gender&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Kyung+Hyun&amp;isbn=9780599306004&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3577,African philosophy of history in the contemporary era: Its antecedents and methodological implications for the African contribution to world history,"This study presents an examination of the relationship between the construction of historical narratives and the construction of individual and social identity in the work of select African historical thinkers from antiquity to the modern era. It is concerned more specifically with describing how some Africans in the modern era (1500 to the present) have used concepts of the continental and Maafan African past--particularly concepts of classical Africa--to inform their cultural and political sensibilities. This is not a study of the writing of history proper; rather, it is an attempt to explore some of the ways in which the past is conceptualized, inscribed and created in order to meet social, political and psychological needs in the present. More specifically, it is an examination of some of the ways that these processes have operated in select Africana nationalist, nationalist-sympathetic and nationalist-influenced discursive formations and intellectual movements in the modern era. After the discussion of the general discursive context of the study, review of prior research and afrocentric research methodology, the development of African historical thought prior to and after the advent of the Maafa is addressed in chapters four, five and six. Chapter five traces the emergence in the nineteenth century of a corpus of African historical thinkers who conceptualized the importance of regional and global African identities and African historical continuity. Chapter six continues the discussion of these figures and chapter seven brings the lineage into the twentieth century. After a symbolic convergence of select strains of African-Centered historical thought in 1954, the description of the lineage of historical thinkers emerging from the mid twentieth century will comprise the balance of chapter eight. As a dissertation in the Department of African-American Studies at Temple University, this dissertation also seeks to contribute to the articulation and operationalization of distinctly Africana Studies disciplinary traditions and methodologies.",304455708,,Dissertations & Theses," Carr, Greg E.

These 7 festivals constituted a 4 month theatre circuit for national and international travelling theatre and street performance troupes. All of these festivals continue to receive more applications from Fringe artist to produce, than they can possibly accommodate. Audience members are willing to stand in line for up to six hours to see a sell-out Fringe show. These events have stimulated a remarkable level of excitement and enthusiasm for theatre. Why? How? These are the central questions that this work approaches from a number of different, and sometimes distinct perspectives. “Part One,” Ordering Chaos , begins with a history of the Fringe that places the festivals in a larger context concerned with Canadian theatre , and in particular the historical relations, social and theatrical, between the alternative theatre movement and the Fringe, and between the Fringe and the postmodern. It includes a description and analysis of the Fringe Production model, Fringe performance, and excerpts from numerous us interviews with Fringe producers, artists, and critics. “Part Two,” The Fringe Phenomenon , observes these events from two different perspectives; one is concerned with festivity, the other with popular culture; both observe the Fringe as a socio-cultural event. Depending primarily on Victor Turner's anthropology of performance and John Fiske's observations on popular culture, I examine the festivals as cultural performances.

Primary data was accumulated through an extended interview with May Stevens and by examining her works on exhibit in New York and Boston. An analysis of selected works from her ""Big Daddy"" and ""Ordinary/Extraordinary"" series revealed how her personal feelings about her own family became entwined with larger political issues. As an important member of the feminist art movement that evolved during the 1970s, she celebrated this new kinship among women in paintings that also explored the contradictions in their lives. In more recent work she has explored complex social issues such as teenage prostitution, sexism, and child abuse in a variety of artistic styles and media.

These groups belong to a wider national and international network of contemplative prayer support groups called Contemplative Outreach. This loosely-structured network of small groups, which typifies a grassroots type of organization which emerged out of the plethora of 1960's social movements for liberation and cultural transformation, was founded by Trappist monk Father Thomas Keating in 1984 in response to the exodus of Catholics who were looking for a meditative practice similar to the popular Eastern methods. Inspired by the reforms of Vatican II, particularly the injunctions to retrieve the Christian contemplative path followed by mystics and saints from the inception of Christianity and to empower the laity in a more democratic ecclesial atmosphere, Keating and two other monks at St. Joseph's Abbey, Spencer, MA rediscovered and reworked the practice of resting in God's silence without dependence on words or images (the apophatic tradition), calling it centering prayer . This study reviews the spiritual heritage of Contemplative Outreach, examines the network's relationship to the hierarchical Roman Catholic church structure which it modifies through a more democratic, lay-oriented, ecumenical design, demonstrates how Contemplative Outreach reflects traits of American culture in which it is embedded, and analyses the evolutionary elements in group process which point towards the building of `family' and community. It is proposed that the predominance of women in Contemplative Outreach, particularly at the small group level, indicates the agility of women in roles which require communicative and relational skills as well as their inclination to mystical practice because of a cognitive framework which emphasizes intuition, empathy, and practicality. Moreover, it is suggested that Contemplative Outreach is representative of a new cultural paradigm which encourages a healing awareness of the interconnectedness of all life, perceived at the mystic level of higher consciousness and through group process.",304472423,,Dissertations & Theses," Yastion, LylaYastionLylaYastion, Lyla", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732999591 , 29184821 , 66569 , 9780599121553 , 0599121556 , 9913673 , 9913673", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780599121553 , 0599121556", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304472423?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0469 Theology"," Cultural anthropology , Religion , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christian-Catholic , Community , Contemplative outreach , Culture , Keating, Thomas , Mystic practice , New York , Prayer groups , Thomas Keating",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Networks+of+contemplative+action+in+American+culture%3A+A+study+of+mystic+practice+and+emergent+community+in+a+contemporary+Christian-Catholic+contemplative+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yastion%2C+Lyla&amp;isbn=9780599121553&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3581,"An embattled idealism: Land reform, the Alliance for Progress, and the struggle for social justice in American foreign policy","The 1960s was a time of great promise and tremendous disappointment in the United States. This was demonstrated in both foreign and domestic policy, from the struggles, triumphs, and continuing frustrations of the Civil Rights movement through the soaring hopes of the Great Society to the escalating tragedy of Vietnam. In this thesis, I suggest that we add the Alliance for Progress to that list as an example of an embattled and eventually defeated idealism in American foreign policy. My central argument is that the idealist notion that American foreign policy in Latin America could and should be a constructive undertaking for all parties involved was a central element in the creation of the Alliance for Progress in the late 1950s and 1960s. Accompanied by the pragmatic concern to prevent the spread of the Cuban Revolution throughout the hemisphere, it was articulated as a call for a socially just foreign policy. Although this vision was consistently pursued by a only a small number of individuals, it had a lasting influence and impact in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Those people who believed in a socially just foreign policy also believed that a key element of such a policy was land reform, and therein lay the rub. To focus on this issue, at least in Latin America, was to pursue a dangerous and doomed policy, as threats to landed power were perceived as threats to good trade relations and anti-communist political alliances. A reading of U.S. government documents, the public record, and archival material from the Kennedy, Johnson, and Agency for International Development Libraries demonstrates a vigorous internal discussion of the role of social justice in foreign policy, and reveals that the tensions between pragmatic and idealistic concerns ultimately doomed the Alliance for Progress as an attempt to redefine the American—Latin American relationship.",304475855,,Dissertations & Theses," Stratton, Sara AnnStrattonAnnSaraStratton, Sara Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733020331 , 29180251 , 66569 , 0612335534 , 9780612335530 , NQ33553 , NQ33553", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 0612335534 , 9780612335530", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304475855?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," American history , Political science , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Alliance for Progress , Foreign policy , Johnson administration , Kennedy administration , Land reform , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+embattled+idealism%3A+Land+reform%2C+the+Alliance+for+Progress%2C+and+the+struggle+for+social+justice+in+American+foreign+policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stratton%2C+Sara+Ann&amp;isbn=0612335534&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3582,"The ""German question"" in the political culture of West Germany in the 1980s: Influence on German-American relations between anti-Americanism and the recognition of the German-Polish border","The dissertation analyzes German-American relations in light of the development of the ""German Question"" during the last years of West Germany. I focus on the political culture of West Germany, where German identity underwent a considerable transformation between the late 1970s and 1990, when the recognition of the German-Polish border and German unification put a preliminary end to the intellectual unrest and to the uncertainty as to a definition of Germany. The argument of the dissertation provides an analysis of several events, which are interpreted as a reflection of a cultural ""debate"" about a beginning redefinition of Germany's self-awareness. Some of those events, Peace Movement and Anti-Americanism, or NATO Modernization Debate, caused transatlantic ramifications; others, such as the institutional crisis of the West German party system, or the rediscovery of ""Heimat"" among the left, went more on the margins of international attention. All of the events were related, though, and at the end of the process West Germany was less certain as to its Western integration. Further, the crisis of pro-Western CDU/CSU conservatism and the advent of a nationalistic right-wing competitor party were both a clear indicator and a consequence of the transformation. It was only Chancellor Kohl's courageous and skillful policy, which rescued the fundamentally West German political tradition of Liberal-Conservatism both from the assaults of the extreme Right and the challenge of Social Democracy at the end of the decade. The ""deeper"" cultural search as to Germany's self-understanding, however could only be pacified for the time being. It is likely to flare up, again. In 1990, the Bonn Republic fulfilled its purpose with unification and the recognition of the German-Polish border, and a 10-year transition period began, at the end of which in 1999 the unified Berlin Republic may determine a transformed understanding of German identity. The intellectual changes which occurred during the last years of West Germany, therefore, are likely to enter into the roots of the Berlin Republic's emerging foreign policy and the likely security posture, with respect to the United States.",304490521,,Dissertations & Theses," Klees, Michael S.KleesS.MichaelKlees, Michael S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 737714321 , 29932571 , 66569 , 9780591848168 , 0591848163 , 9831862 , 9831862", Dissertation/Thesis, 1998," 9780591848168 , 0591848163", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304490521?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," International law , International relations , European history , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+%22German+question%22+in+the+political+culture+of+West+Germany+in+the+1980s%3A+Influence+on+German-American+relations+between+anti-Americanism+and+the+recognition+of+the+German-Polish+border&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klees%2C+Michael+S.&amp;isbn=9780591848168&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3583,Cross-cultural communication and the teaching of English,"More and more linguists and English teachers have realized that second language acquisition is the acquisition of what D. Hymes had called ""Communicative competence"". That is, becoming an effective speaker of a new language not only involves acquiring new vocabulary, phonetics and grammar, but involves the ability to use these linguistic resources in ways that are socially appropriate among speakers of the target language.Often is the case that students who have learned English for several years may master a considerable vocabulary and grammatical rules, but cannot actually communicate effectively with native speakers. The pragmatic failure lies in the lacking of cultural aware-ness of target culture, which forms a barrier in cross-cultural communication. A tentative study of culture, language and communication and their relationship would surely help improve the quality of cross-cultural communication and the learning and teaching of English.The first part is designed to define and present a general view of culture and communication, discuss possible relationship between language and culture, but also cope with characteristics, components of communication. It also deals with cross cultural communication.Culture is a hard to define term, and for years numerous definitions have been given by sociolinguists, anthropologists and ethnographers. Among them, R. H. Crapo' s definition threw a new light on our perception: ""Culture is a learned system of beliefs, feelings and rules for living, around which a group of people organize their lives; a way of a particular society"".Language and culture is closely related. On the one hand, language is a part of culture. It is the symbolic representation of a culture. It recorded the origin and development of a particular culture. Without language, culture would be impossible. As we know, people in one community must live under certain social, cultural background, and communicate with one language. It is quite an illusion that one can understand fully a language without the basic knowledge of the target culture which influences and shapes language. Culture exerts no small influence over our use of language. In fact, it strongly determines just what our language is, and how we use it Neglecting cultural factors in language would lead to failures in cross-cultural communication and language teaching and learning.Communication derives from people s need to contact with each other. It is generally defined as the process of transmitting in-formation. It is transactional because the meaning shared is created between and among participants based on both the original message (or the behavioral source) and the response to it.There are five characteristics about communication. Firstly, communication is dynamic. Secondly, communication is interactive. Thirdly, communication skills are acquired. Fourthly, communication is irreversible. Lastly, communication takes place in both physical and social context.As people exchange messages in different ways, such as speech, writing, body movements, either linguistically or nonlinguistically, communication thus falls into two main categories, verbal and nonverbal. Linguistic symbols usually cover phonemes, morphemes, words, and sentences, which are studied in phonology, semantics and syntax. All these belong to verbal communication, while non-verbal behaviors, such as gestures, facial expressions, eye contacts, space, etc., belong to nonverbal communication.Verbal means of communication is the main means of human communication while nonverbal means is often complementary to verbal one. Nonetheless, equal attention should be paid on nonverbal communication since it can also affect communication.As far as the relation between culture and communication is concerned, we can conclude that not all communication is culture and not all culture is communication. This can be illustrated by two overlapping circles. Central to cultural communications are the twin accomplishments of mutual intelligibility and shared identity, common meaning and membership.Cross-cultural communication refers to communication between or among interlocutors of different cultural background.Part II deals with the verbal and nonverbal behaviors of English and Chinese speakers, some rules of speaking as well as rules for interpersonal dimensions of body language. The teaching of English is pertinent to a very important line of research, which relates to the study of sociolinguistic behavior and to transfer. This is known as interactional Sociolingistics. From the point of view of the TESOL, the aim of this study is to try to understand how miscommunication occurs, and by providing these insights, to learn how it may best be avoided. This is an increasingly important question, since modern urban industrialized societies require that people interact, very often with total strangers, across different cultural boundaries. The success or failure of such interactions depends on the ability of the participants to avoid misunderstandings based on different sets of sociocultural assumptions and behavior patterns and thus to communication with one another effectively.In this respect, this part offers a general analysis of verbal and non-verbal communication rules between Chinese and English speakers, such as (1) address forms (2) greetings (3) compliments (4) apologies (5) partings in verbal communication, while (6) gestures (7) facial expressions (8) eye contacts and (9) space in nonverbal communication. The purpose is not to cover all the sociolinguistic rules, but rather to guide the English learners to a better understanding of the target culture, so that they can achieve communicative competence, thus to facilitate English learning in classrooms.Part III investigates the significance of cultural studies in English teaching and how the application may enhance student's awareness of the culture of their target language.Studies on cross-cultural factors are crucial to the students' communicative competence. As language is the carrier of a culture, it is impossible to learn English well without knowing the culture of English speaking countries. On the contrary, the more deeply one knows about the history, convention, and way of life, etc. of another country, the more correctly one can understand and use the language.Cultural studies also find its way into social-political aspects. With the rapid development of China's economy, China has more frequent contacts with foreign countries. Meanwhile, as the ""global village"" emerges, the methods for bringing people close physically and electronically are clearly at hand. Consequently, interpersonal communication under different cultural background cannot be avoided. Many teachers support that foreign language learning is for the ""purposes of cultivating international understanding responsibility, and effective participation in a global age"". (Kramach, 1991)In the implication of cultural studies, a new approach in language learning and teaching has been put forward by Michael Byram, the ""language for cultural understanding"". So teachers of English should facilitate the learners to a more sensitiveness towards English culture in the following way: (1) textbooks (2) lectures (3) readings (4) movies (5) discussions and soon.As we can see, with respect to the analysis of interaction between members of different cultural groups, the implications for the teaching of sociocultual rules are equally inescapable. English teachers therefor bear two tasks: one is to teach the students' linguistic knowledge; the other is to enable the students to acquire some sociolinguistic rules of the target culture. Only by doing so can students get rid of some possible pragmatic failures and become more competent in cross-cultural communication.",1024698769, 跨文化交际与英语教学,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Yuan ShuZhangShuYuanZhang, Yuan Shu张淑媛", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709457251 , 70358482 , 189128 , H042372 , H042372", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, Chinese, Chinese, 跨文化交际与英语教学,1999,PQDT - Global,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024698769?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," (UMI)AAIH042372 , Language, literature and linguistics , 自由词 , 英语教学 , 跨文化交际 , 跨文化研究",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cross-cultural+communication+and+the+teaching+of+English&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Yuan+Shu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3584,Gender migration and identity: spanish migrant women in london,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of international migration in shaping the national and gender identities of Spanish women, who migrated to England between 1940-1992. The thesis examines the process of construction of these women's national and gender identities in their country of origin. However, international migration means a change of socio-cultural and linguistic context that may call into question these women's notions of femininity and national identity. Thus, the thesis analyses in considerable detail how different women migrants use aspects of their cultural heritage as frameworks in shaping their national and gender identities in England. This thesis is structured in three main parts. The first part deals with the theoretical decisions taken in this thesis and also questions the categorisations of migrants found in the literature. The first part positions the thesis within a theoretical framework and a specific research design used in this study. One appendix expands on the decisions which are taken. The second part analyses the constructions of gender and national identities in Spain before migration. It examines political ideology and definitions of femininity imposed on Spanish women via the Catholic Church, the school and the government. Women's narratives reveal the shaping of Spanish gendered identities, in different social classes and generations. The third part examines the role of the Spanish and the British governments in the movement of Spanish migrants to the UK and the ways their policies treated male and female migration differently. However a major emphasis is placed on how women in their own accounts of their experiences tried to transform these discourses - and the discourses on femininity - which confronted them. The conclusion includes reflections on the implications of this study for the existing literature concerning gender, international migration and processes of identity formation.",1779545534,,Dissertations & Theses," Bravo-Moreno, AnaBravo-MorenoAnaBravo-Moreno, Ana", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015235841 , 102023192 , 101309 , 10081710 , 10081710 , http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/19784/", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779545534?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/19784/ , (UMI)AAI10081710 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gender+migration+and+identity%3A+spanish+migrant+women+in+london&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bravo-Moreno%2C+Ana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3585,Bioregions and future state visioning: a visually integrative approach to the presentation of information for environmental policy and management,"This thesis explores the comparatively new philosophy of bioregionalism to see what it might have to offer the environmental management process. The foundations of bioregional philosophy stretch back into the early part of last century with roots in the thinking of the early 'anarchist geographers' such as Peter Kropotkin. Input also comes from contemporaneous regionalist planners such as Patrick Geddes and Lewis Mumford. However, it was not until the early 1970s that Alan van Newkirk coined the phrase 'Bioregion'. Since then there has been steady growth in bioregional literature that clearly aligns it to ecocentric philosophies that are embraced by social movements like ""Deep Ecology"". However, the most important part of bioregionalism is the bioregions construct. Whatever the philosophical inclinations of bioregionalist authors, the bioregion is presented as an identifiable entity, which is suited to be the basis for the formulation of strategy and planning and it is this that is of interest to this thesis. The basis for the study is the hypothesis that the need for a holistic approach to environmental management and planning requires more than the incremental approaches currently used, if tragedies like Easter Island are not to be repeated on a larger scale. The idea of future state visioning is taken from industry and commerce and given an environmental perspective to provide the visionary dimension required by such a holistic process. However, a visionary process is best served by a visualization tool, particularly where non-expert, community participation is deemed essential. The process of mapping bioregions is just such a tool. The proposal that bioregional mapping is suitable as a tool requires that bioregions, as a construct, are demonstrable entities, as claimed by the literature. Tberefore, a mapping exercise that allowed the testing of this principle was undertaken for Scotland as the test area. A methodology was developed, using a Geographical Information System to assist in the mapping and analysis. Statistical analysis of the resultant theoretical bioregional model showed that the bioregions had good agreement with other methods of dividing Scotland into regions. They also showed better agreement with these other regionalisations than politically defined regions. The notion that watersheds can be substituted for bioregions was rejected. Therefore, it was shown that bioregions are demonstrable entities,albeit sensitive to scale. The bioregions produced from first principles were compared to an independent qualitatively developed model, The results of this comparison reinforces a suggestion that a 'science of quantities' needs to be tempered by a 'science of qualities' when stakeholder participation and interpretation is important. The dramatic story of the social and environmental collapse of Easter Island is a metaphor for the situation facing the Earth, as a whole on the one hand, and to introduce the arguments of sustainability and regionality on the other. Easter Island is isolated, with almost no external inputs, like the Earth, but on a different scale. However, it is also a part of the Earth. From many sources, there is agreement that the natural environment of the Earth is under threat, not just on the local scale but on a global scale as well. Bioregions are proposed as a holistic way of mapping the environment to inform the future state visioning process, which is offered as a tool at the level of strategic management. Bioregional mapping and environmental future state visioning were proposed as vehicles for stakeholder participation and the recognition of cultural factors in environmental management and planning. Future work should include investigating future state visioning solutions to more localised and community focused environmental management problems. Scotland, as the subject for analysis, provides a manageable compromise between the extreme isolation and singularity of Easter Island and the multiplicity of the regions of the world. Scotland is an area that has good data on its various forms of regionality, including cultural and biogeographic regions.",1819953843,,Dissertations & Theses," Ball, JonathanBallJonathanBall, Jonathan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4183785731 , 107812252 , 101309 , U119215 , U119215 , http://hdl.handle.net/10059/535", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819953843?accountid=14496, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0503 Agricultural economics, Agricultural economics," http://hdl.handle.net/10059/535 , (UMI)AAIU119215 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bioregions+and+future+state+visioning%3A+a+visually+integrative+approach+to+the+presentation+of+information+for+environmental+policy+and+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ball%2C+Jonathan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3586,"Entertainment or edification?: A contextual analysis of Simon Goulart's ""Thresor d'Histoires Admirables""","Simon Goulart (1543 - 1628), one of the most prolific writers of his generation, remains an enigma. Modem historians have repeatedly ignored Goulart's vast literary output, failing to recognise and understand his real importance within the Protestant movement. Goulart's life spanned almost six decades, years which would have a deep and lasting impact upon the Reformed church in general and Goulart's work in particular. Indeed, Goulart recorded many of these formative events in his various historical works. This thesis aims to redress this serious imbalance in both our historical knowledge and our understanding, an attempt to locate Goulart within his rightful place at the centre of late sixteenth and early seventeenth-century Reformed life and writing. As will be seen from this thesis, Goulart's life was intimately connected with the history of the Reformed during this turbulent era. Simon Goulart is by no means an easy figure to understand. From his own writings as well as other contemporary sources, reveal Goulart to be a dynamic but pedantic man, embittered and worn down by years of struggle. A fervent moralist, Goulart leaves the reader with little sense of optimism or satisfaction. As a minister he was relentless in the condemnation of his parishioners; as a historian he was swift to denounce both his enemies and his allies, and as a politician he openly criticised established values and ideas. Whilst never a truly original thinker, as this study of the Histoires Admirables will reveal, Goulart spent much of his life attempting to publicise, persuade and popularise his moral and historical agenda. The Histoires Admirables were a central part of this task. Goulart's views cannot be ignored: they go to the heart of the contemporary world which he both supported and condemned. A thorough study of Goulart's life and works is revealing of both the moral and the religious situation which existed in Geneva following the death of Calvin in 1564, a period which still remains notably understudied. Goulart simply cannot be divorced from his contemporary world, a world in which he became so deeply engaged. Not only was Goulart one of the leading pastors in Geneva, but following Beza's death in 1605 he became the principal voice of Reformed politics and belief, both within Geneva and beyond. Beyond this he had an established reputation as a minister and writer with an international following and reputation. Indeed, he was one of the most prominent of all Reformed writers. Through a study of a selected number of Goulart's works, and the Histoires Admirables in particular, not only will Goulart's writings and thought be better understood, but a considerable insight can be gained into his social, political and religious world.",1826494193,,Dissertations & Theses," Schlesinger, Joanna MiaSchlesingerMiaJoannaSchlesinger, Joanna Mia", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4206715511 , 108223052 , 189128 , 9781369211214 , 10166761 , 10166761", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999, 9781369211214, English, English,,1999,PQDT - Global,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826494193?accountid=14496, 0313 Romance literature, 0313 Romance literature, 0313 Romance literature,, 0313 Romance literature, Romance literature," (UMI)AAI10166761 , Language, literature and linguistics , France , Goulart, Simon",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Entertainment+or+edification%3F%3A+A+contextual+analysis+of+Simon+Goulart%27s+%22Thresor+d%27Histoires+Admirables%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schlesinger%2C+Joanna+Mia&amp;isbn=9781369211214&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3587,"Sport, policy and europeanisation: process and interest mediation in european union decision making","The thesis seeks to analyse the implications of the deepening and widening of the European Union for sport and leisure-related policy developments. Firstly, the work seeks to establish an appropriate conceptual framework through which to review how the process of Europeanisation is influencing sport and leisure policies. The term Europeanisation refers to the changing nature of relations between regional, national and supranational tiers of governance. Secondly, the thesis reviews the literature on the progression of EU level sports and leisure policy interventions since 1957. The range of rationales in operation, and the maturation of those rationales over the last forty years, is considered. The capacity for European level intervention has grown significantly through the development of EU socio-political and economic integration policies, the most significant being the four freedoms (the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons) and the associated legislation. The empirical work subsequently reviews the implications of the Europeanisation process for three areas of decision-making: sports broadcasting rights, the use of European Structural Funds and the debate on a EU competence for sport. Drawing on both figurational sociology and policy network analysis, the research identifies the key stakeholders involved in the policy process and seeks to illustrate the nature of the policy-making processes. The thesis progresses the argument that the development of economic, social and political inter-dependencies, along transnational rather than national lines, are inevitably leading to questions over the role of the nation state and the institutions of the European Union. Accordingly, the research identifies and evaluates the positions held by the key actors, on central issues, within each of the three areas of policy and reflects on the distribution and management of key resources.",301524791,,Dissertations & Theses," Matthews, NicolaMatthewsNicolaMatthews, Nicola", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759105641 , 44768761 , 101309 , U146596 , U146596", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301524791?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU146596 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sport%2C+policy+and+europeanisation%3A+process+and+interest+mediation+in+european+union+decision+making&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Matthews%2C+Nicola&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3588,"Carl peters and german imperialism, 1856-1918: a political biography","Carl Peters (1856-1918) ranked among Germany's most prominent imperialists in the Bismarckian and Wilhelmine period. He became widely known as the 'founder' of German East Africa and a leader of the colonial movement. This biography argues that Peters was skillful agitator who had a good sense for the appeal of colonial ideas and gave them a strong voice. Thus he came to a ride a wave of public enthusiasm which may be seen as a significant force for German colonial expansion. Essentially, Peters' imperialist ideology reflected a nationalist agenda, the central reference point of which was Germany's unification through war in 1871. Pan-Germanism was the central doctrine for the achievement of world power, while Britain emerged as Germany's major rival in the struggle between nations. This concept is derived from a pseudo-Darwinist model of international conflict. The group around Peters formed the nucleus of a movement which was not a convenient tool in the hands of the government, instead on several occasions becoming a nationalist opposition to official policies. In 1896 a major colonial scandal brought about Peters' fall. The Social Democrats accused Peters of two arbitrary executions on Kilimanjaro in 1891/1892. It is argued that the most damaging element of this attack was the implicit charge that Peters had 'gone native'. Public accusations portrayed him as a man who had adopted the customs of an African chief; acting like a savage, he was perceived as a betrayer of Europe's civilizing mission.

It also focuses on the structure of the musical profession itself, and the ways in which practical concerns - the fact the state was effectively paying composers' wages - often played as significant a role as ideological factors in determining policy. What emerges as perhaps the most striking feature of this study is the absence of a coherent Party line on many issues, and the extent to which members of the musical profession themselves played a significant role in defining the boundaries within which they lived and worked.

It addresses the ideas and practices of avant-garde art and political groups in western Europe that sought to transform the geographies of cities and everyday life. A prominent focus is on the Situationist International, a group of artists, writers and revolutionaries active in the 1950s and 1960s, and on their immediate avant-garde predecessors. Through an investigation of primary sources including writings, art works and records about the activities of the situationists and others, I explore their engagement with geographical issues, and provide an original account of their concern with the ways in which urban spaces are imagined, represented, contested and produced. I argue that their projects contain important insights about the geographies of urbanism, power and spatial politics, and that they have implications for a number of debates in contemporary cultural and urban geography. Although the groups have been the subject of increasing interest in recent years, the importance of their 'critique of human geography' remains neglected especially in terms of radical geographical thought, where their association with Henri Lefebvre is of particular interest, and in connection with other currents of utopian thinking about cities. My study approaches the situationists and associated avant-gardes from the perspective of the utopian search for a new society and urban space. The connections between utopian thought and the city have ancient roots. But I am particularly interested in the significance these avant-gardes attached to the contestation and production of urban space as an essential part of the revolutionary transformation of society, and to the necessity of thinking spatial and social change together. In addressing this theme, I start by turning back to earlier utopian imaginings of urban space that have been of considerable influence on the discourses and practices of modernist planning, based around the garden city movement and the 'modern movement' in early twentieth-century western Europe. By re-examining the texts and proposals of two of their prominent figures, Ebenezer Howard and especially Le Corbusier, I explore the 'dreams of urban order' of utopian spaces often associated with modernist urbanism; and by re-connecting them with other lines of utopian thinking within the avant-gardes, I seek to destabilise some of their assumptions and to emphasise the contested ideals within modernism about what the geographies of cities might be. Such a reconsideration connects with recent interest in researching the heterogeneity of modernisms across disciplinary fields, as well as the complexities of historical geographies of modernity. My concern with counter-currents of utopianism from within the avant-gardes moves from the surrealists in the 1920s and 1930s, with their criticisms of rationalist modernism and their interest in other dream spaces, to the post-war projects of the situationists and associated groups. With respect to the situationists, I concentrate on their critiques of urban spectacle and of earlier planning visions, and on their charting of alternative utopian routes through the ideas and practices of 'psychogeography' and 'unitary urbanism'. The latter was based on brining together a critique of urbanism with a critique of everyday life as a means of affecting revolutionary change. In this way, I not only recover ideas and materials that have often been neglected in histories of modernist urbanism, but also to work with them to intervene in intellectual and political fields especially around the production and contestation of urban space. While contemporary critics have often drawn attention to the difficulty of imagining different urban futures and to a supposed 'death of utopia', this work contests claims about such an ending. It asserts the continuing importance of utopian thought for rad",301545995,,Dissertations & Theses," Pinder, David JohnPinderJohnDavidPinder, David John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757881881 , 44718231 , 101309 , U124841 , U124841", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301545995?accountid=14496, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0999 Urban planning, Urban planning," (UMI)AAIU124841 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Utopian+spaces+of+the+avant-garde&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pinder%2C+David+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3591,"'The ruses of desire': space, time, and utopia in Fourier, the surrealists and the situationist international.","Modern utopias have, I argue, taken the form of critiques of the dominant temporal and spatial discourses. Modern time-space discourses are totalising - the discourse of Progress projects the concept of 'the new' over the whole historical process, and Perspectivism represents space as a totality. These totalising discourses are inherently fractured. Modernity's historical narrative valorises a dynamic new, yet also reduces it to an abstraction. Attempts to totalise space, under the fixed gaze of the planner, are resisted by 'blind' spatial practices. Utopias are 'expressions of desire', whose distance from the real can give them a critical function, which can be aimed at the dominant forms for time-space organisation. In modernity, the multiplicity of utopian readings of time and space suggests a critical reflection on their contradictory nature. This critique can take the form of subverting, transcending, or disenchanting dominant time-space discourses, although contradictory and conservative readings are also in evidence. These strategies represent 'ruses of desire' - the desire for a better state of being engages in 'ruses' in order to seek its object within the time-space real. I have investigated my hypothesis by examining; the nineteenth century utopian Charles Fourier , the Surrealist movement and the Situational International . These form a common tradition linked by a utopian desire for a 'better state of being'. All of these currents engage with modern time-space. Fourier imagines a spatial order which reconciles the individual and the social, transcending modern spatial discourses in which the two are counterposed. However, he also effects a more conservative reading, in which space, and social action, are mapped by a fixed, distanciated gaze. The Surrealist 'New Myth' celebrates the historicity of the modern, 'releasing' it from the abstract form it assumes in the discourses of Progress, and thus subverting them. Situationist utopian urbanism exposes the contradiction at the heart of dominant discourse of space caused by the resistance of mobile spatial practices to the planner's gaze, thus performing a disenchanting function. Further, their call to the construction of urban situations, and Situationist cities, seeks to subvert totalised space by encouraging countervailing lived spatial practices.",301572311,,Dissertations & Theses," Russell, C.

It is a work of contemporary history, rather than political science, and is based on archival research, a series of interviews with key participants and a variety of secondary sources. The thesis seeks to make two main arguments. First, it is argued that there are serious debates within the Labour Party - and amongst groups sympathetic to the Labour Party and trying to influence its policy - about economic strategy. The most important of these debates are about the ideas behind economic strategy - about how the economy should be understood, the role of markets and the state, and about British economic decline - rather than the fine detail of policy. Accounts of the period which stress the importance of Labour's political marketing, and claim that the Labour Party's policy-making was driven by opinion polls, focus groups, and the desire for electoral popularity, do not give adequate weight to these debates. The second argument is that Labour's economic strategy develops so that, by 1992, it is best characterised as 'neo-revisionist'. The thesis considers a number of theories of social democratic economic strategy including structural dependence, labour movement and revisionism. It argues that Labour's position in 1992 had a number of key similarities with Crosland's revisionism. Further, this neo-revisionism is not, as some have argued, a pale reflection of revisionism constrained by international economic pressures. In a number of areas, such as its attitude to reform of the state, Labour's position in the 1980s was more radical. The research contributes to a clearer understanding of Labour Party policy-making, and debates concerning the influence of ideas on the political process, and the nature of social democratic economic strategy.",301591222,,Dissertations & Theses," Hill, RichardHillRichardHill, Richard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1758000431 , 44746951 , 101309 , U111266 , U111266", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301591222?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU111266 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+democracy+and+economic+strategy%3A+the+labour+party+in+opposition+1979+-+1992&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hill%2C+Richard&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3593,Landscape in the construction of identity: The making of an English image,"My ethnohistorical project takes historical class relations and traces various steps in the cultural production of class and national identity in England, specifically as it has operated through landscape and access to it. It deals with an intense and unusually protracted engagement with landscape as it has occurred in literary, aesthetic, artistic, political, legislative, recreational and educative dimensions, and treats landscape as an idiom for the materializing of culture. Foregrounding an aesthetic ally-informed 18th-century discourse of nation allows me to delineate an educated elite's ‘imagined community’ that centered on painted, printed and actual unpeopled landscapes. I contextualize this imagined community within articulation and practices of British nationalism and popularization of the Picturesque aesthetic. The valorization of unpeopled landscapes becomes a point from which to negotiate a series of related fields of tension within ‘polite society’, as well as between polite society and the enclosure movement's immiseration of the dispossessed. I show how the Lake and Peak Districts became sounding boards of national sentiment that exposed different claims to history, and that the Lake District, around which ‘a’ version of an homogenous English national identity was constructed by an intellectual elite, paradoxically became the site of cultural differentiation of class participation. Legislative, legal and extra-legal challenges made to legal, quasi-legal and illegal practices of denying access preceed an overview of post-1945 legislation by which national parks were established in England and Wales between 1951 and 1957. This section ends with the reemergence in the 1990s of demands for open access to land within and beyond national parks. My multi-sited peripatetic ethnography of the Lake District investigates how walking groups and clubs are a socially constitutive force shaping personal identity and a ‘sense’ of community under the impact of social fragmentation, global economic restructuring, and European integration. I address race and the English landscape as a landscape of non-identity, as well as bringing a gendered view of walking.

In addition the Cypriot Left was and is ant-imperialist. But its anti-imperialism is also differentiated from the dominant communal nationalisms on the island—it expresses a form of bicommunal civil patriotism of the islanders. Thus the Cypriot Left seems to be a case of hybridity of different forms of the global Left. This hybridity is explored through a concept of the Left as a totality encompassing a variety of ideological and organizational forms. In the context of this totality, different questions are addressed at different levels of analysis—systemic, structural, situational. The empirical focus is on the period 1920–60—the period of the emergence and consolidation of the Left. The origins of communism, as class politics, and the development of leftist patriotism are traced to the systemic level. The emergence of communism and trade unionism coincided with the “deepening of capitalist development” on the island and more left with the process of proletarianization as a result of the integration of the island' in the capitalist world economy. And the development of leftist patriotism was a response to the position of the island as a geopolitical “border/frontier”. The democratic reformism of the Left and its dual form of politics and organizational structure (“ideological Autonomy” and to “national/popular unity”) are related to the political structures which it had to confront: the liberal colonial context and the regime of negative integration in a society In which anti-colonialism was a rising sentiment. The cultural roots of the Left and the loyalty of the leftist masses are related to the transformation of Cypriot plebeian culture into a modern idiom through the ideological framework of communism and the collective experience of historical confrontations and transformations in the middle of the century.",304499007,,Dissertations & Theses," Panayiotou, AndreasPanayiotouAndreasPanayiotou, Andreas", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729769361 , 30397531 , 66569 , 9780599417311 , 0599417315 , 9940276 , 9940276", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599417311 , 0599417315", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304499007?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0582 History"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0582 History"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0582 History",," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0582 History"," Social structure , Political science , History"," Social sciences , Communism , Cypriot , Ethnic identity , Geopolitics , Left , Radicals , Working class movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Island+radicals%3A+The+emergence+and+consolidation+of+the+Cypriot+Left%2C+1920-1960&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Panayiotou%2C+Andreas&amp;isbn=9780599417311&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3595,"All roads lead to Rome: French and German Christian democrats, the nation -state and the construction of Europe, 1945-1950","Historians of postwar Europe dispute the origins of European integration. Some focus on anti-national sentiment and the European Movement's activities. From this perspective, Europe and nation-state were competing concepts: Europe was conceived to replace the nation-state. Others focus on government policies and the role of national interests. For these historians, Europe and nation-state complemented one another, and integration was a policy designed to reinforce the nation-state. The latter interpretation is convincing, yet it simplifies and undervalues the role of ideas in the origins of integration. This dissertation re-evaluates the role of ideas through a focus on the French and German Christian Democratic parties. It concentrates on the connections between domestic political doctrine and the European policies developed by each party between 1945 and 1950. As political parties, the Mouvement républicain populaire (MRP) and the Christlich Demokratische Union (CDU) existed in a middle ground between the “idealistic” European activists and “realistic” government officials. Each party sought not only the construction of Europe, but the reconstruction of the French or German nation-state. Using documents from personal and party archives, this dissertation examines how the French and German parties conceptualized their activities and how each described its mission to members and outsiders. Neither party initially gave Europe much emphasis; each sought first to elaborate a vision of national renewal that would overcome confessional divisions and address contemporary social concerns. In response to domestic and international pressures, each eventually embraced the idea of European unification, yet neither accepted existing definitions of “Europe.” Each struggled to develop a vision of Europe compatible with its domestic doctrine. In spite of their common Christian worldview, no single Christian Democratic vision of Europe emerged. French and German Christian Democrats espoused different definitions of “Christian Democracy” and their views of Europe mirrored their domestic orientations. For the “progressive” MRP, Europe helped guard against a threatened right-wing revival; for the “conservative” CDU, Europe countered the advance of Marxist materialism.",304500866,,Dissertations & Theses," Powers, Daniel GerardPowersGerardDanielPowers, Daniel Gerard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730306041 , 30139631 , 66569 , 9780599473515 , 0599473517 , 9945518 , 9945518", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599473515 , 0599473517", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304500866?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science",," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," European history , Political science"," Social sciences , Christian , Christian Democratic Union , Democrats , Europe , French , German , Mouvement Republicain Populaire , Nation-state",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=All+roads+lead+to+Rome%3A++French+and+German+Christian+democrats%2C+the+nation+-state+and+the+construction+of+Europe%2C+1945-1950&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Powers%2C+Daniel+Gerard&amp;isbn=9780599473515&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3596,"Defining communities: The nation, the firm, the neighborhood, and Japanese-Brazilian migrants in Japan","Recent theories of hybridity present attractive alternatives to the assimilationist assumptions which inform many studies of migration. Yet a celebration of hybridity fails to reckon with the spread of ethnonationalist movements and ignores continuing state restrictions on immigration and naturalization. Globalization has not diminished people's desire for some sense of “authenticity” or “wholeness.” This dissertation explores the way in which Japanese and Japanese Brazilian migrants to Japan construct workplaces and neighborhoods “communities” that meet such desires for wholeness. In the late 1980s, economic troubles in Brazil and demand for flexible industrial labor in Japan led to a revision of Japanese immigration policy, facilitating the migration of overseas Japanese ( nikkei-jin ) to work in Japan. By 1996, there were over 230,000 nikkei-jin , mostly Brazilian, in Japan. I conducted dissertation fieldwork from February 1994 through April 1996 in the city of Hamamatsu, Japan, where roughly 10,000 Japanese Brazilians have been working in automobile and electronics factories. I show that Japanese immigration policy and labor markets both operate to segment and differentiate groups from each other. Rather than overwhelming Japanese culture or giving rise to hybrid cultural forms, global social and cultural flows have primarily stimulated an “oppositional florescence” in which groups distinguish themselves from each other by emphasizing key symbols of their already existing cultures. One of the key symbols that Japanese have appropriated for themselves is a commitment to community. Based on interviews and participant observation in a large automobile firm, I conclude that Japanese workers' sense of community depends at least in part on their success in a very competitive environment for promotion. Through interviews with nikkei-jin and Japanese workers injured in workplace accidents, I suggest that nikkei-jin share Japanese desires to belong to communities in which they are respected. I also looked at neighborhoods, examining how Japanese Brazilians built a community around a Brazilian culture center, and then how Japanese represented their neighborhoods and city as communities during the Hamamatsu Kite Festival. I analyze one occasion during this festival in which participants incorporated Brazilian people and culture, giving rise to a syncretic cultural form deriving from Japanese and Brazilian sources.",304501351,,Dissertations & Theses," Roth, Joshua HotakaRothHotakaJoshuaRoth, Joshua Hotaka", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733967041 , 31232641 , 66569 , 9780599271067 , 059927106X , 9927404 , 9927404", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599271067 , 059927106X", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304501351?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , Labor relations , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Communities , Firm , Japanese-Brazilian , Migrants , Nation , Neighborhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defining+communities%3A+The+nation%2C+the+firm%2C+the+neighborhood%2C+and+Japanese-Brazilian+migrants+in+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roth%2C+Joshua+Hotaka&amp;isbn=9780599271067&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3597,"Literary history and the Age of Jazz: Generation, renaissance, and American literary modernism","This study investigates the degree to which movements determine the shape of literary modernism in the United States. After providing an archaeological assessment of the Lost Generation and the Harlem Renaissance, I trace important aesthetic innovations suggested by these metaphors, including the rise of what I call the “bohemian artist narrative,” a self-reflexive genre comprised of artist novels and memoirs. Chapters one (“Unearthing the ‘Lost Generation’ ”) and two (“Rebirthing the Negro Nation”) examine, from a sociology of aesthetics perspective, the role of these metaphors in shaping literary production and in determining the scope of critical responses to literary works. Generational and renaissance rhetoric inform a transnational, polyethnic discourse concerned with articulating a cultural nationalist aesthetic stance and archiving the emergence of national literatures. While I begin with the so-called Irish Renaissance of the nineteenth century and end with the Beat Generation of the postmodern era, the primary focus of these chapters is the Jazz Age of the 1910s and 1920s. Chapter three (“''The Invention of Jean Toomer”) provides an interpretation of Toomer's Cane (1923) against the backdrop of the book's initial marketing campaign and early reception history in order to demonstrate the influence of the tropes of the Lost Generation and Harlem Renaissance. Chapters four (“American Modernism is Born”) and five (“The Modernist Generation”) examine an important development in twentieth-century aesthetics, the modernist preoccupation with narrative self-reflexivity. My primary concern is with the thematic expression of reading and writing practices; specifically, as these are realized in bohemian novels and memoirs. The rapid proliferation of the bohemian artist narrative in the U.S. reveals a growing concern not only with the inner world created by literature, but also with the outer world in which literature is created, including the social worlds imagined as the Lost Generation and the Harlem Renaissance. I demonstrate how writers as diverse as Oscar Zeta Acosta, Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, John Clellon Holmes, Zora Neale Hurston, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Henry Miller, Diane di Prima, Gertrude Stein, and William Carlos Williams imaginatively conceive of American literary emergence in terms of symbolic birth (or rebirth) into a generation.",304504032,,Dissertations & Theses," Soto, MichaelSotoMichaelSoto, Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730221461 , 30139171 , 66569 , 9780599521919 , 0599521910 , 9949807 , 9949807", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599521919 , 0599521910", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304504032?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0298 Literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0298 Literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0298 Literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies",," 0591 American literature , 0298 Literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," American literature , Literature , American history , American studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Harlem Renaissance , Jazz Age , Literary history , Lost Generation , Modernism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Literary+history+and+the+Age+of+Jazz%3A++Generation%2C+renaissance%2C+and+American+literary+modernism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soto%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=9780599521919&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3598,"Submerged politics, exiled histories: Memory and identity at the borders of the Balkans","This thesis examines contemporary debates about the “Istrian exodus,” the mass flight of ethnic Italians that occurred after World War II when the Istrian peninsula passed from Italian to Yugoslav sovereignty. Through analysis of narratives and practices that forge memories of displacement, the dissertation asks a central question: How does a classic borderzone give way to modern states and how can a perspective from the periphery illuminate the development of both homogenizing nationalisms and transnational movements celebrating hybridity? Why do border areas prove fruitful sites from which to consider the rebundling of sovereignty claims, as well as the reconfiguration of historical narratives about state-making? In answering these questions, the dissertation draws upon material gathered during twenty months of fieldwork in Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. Methods employed included participant- observation, formal interviewing and archival research. Works consulted in the course of archival research include local newspapers from the period of the exodus, 900 statements given at the time of events by Italians fleeing Istria, Allied Military Government documentation at the U.S. National Archives, and contemporary journals and books published by Istrian exile associations in Italy. Analysis of oral and written histories revealed extensive continuities between narratives of exodus articulated today with those produced at the time of events, as well as earlier nationalist understandings. Situating contemporary accounts of exodus in fight of older narrative frameworks, I argue against narrowly presentist interpretations of identity. Instead, I look at the way that memory is continually made in the present through frameworks that have been given though time. Viewing contemporary historical consciousness as shaped by a century of war and state recomposition, my project denaturalizes borders and reveals the Julian March's historical construction as a zone in which there have emerged competing discourses about “pure” and “hybrid” identities. I conclude that in such borderzones, discourses about purity and hybridity have lengthy and shared histories, with notions of hybridity leaving in place assumptions about “essential” or pure cultural wholes. This finding refutes the claim, prevalent in much current social theory, that hybridity represents a novel political alternative to essentialist understandings of identity.",304507215,,Dissertations & Theses," Ballinger, Pamela LynnBallingerLynnPamelaBallinger, Pamela Lynn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733095951 , 31227641 , 66569 , 9780599197824 , 059919782X , 9920684 , 9920684", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599197824 , 059919782X", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304507215?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , European history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Balkans , Identity , Italy , Memory , Politics , Refugees , World War II , Yugoslavia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Submerged+politics%2C+exiled+histories%3A+Memory+and+identity+at+the+borders+of+the+Balkans&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ballinger%2C+Pamela+Lynn&amp;isbn=9780599197824&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3599,Art and cultural difference in the era of globalization: A comparative study of Taiwanese and American installation artworks,"This study examines selected installation artworks in the United States and in Taiwan in an attempt to lay bare the particular Taiwanese social and cultural conditions that are accountable factors for the differences in the two bodies of works. Employing aesthetic anthropology as methodology, the researcher has attended to issues of translation and transnation of the cultural field of Taiwan, the problematics of cultural nativism reflected in the selected Taiwanese artworks, and artistic globalization and its effects on the development of art in the local sphere. In addition, the study explores the lineage of today's installation artworks—namely European Avant-garde movements, environmental art, and earth art—in order to outline their major concepts and artistic concerns. Through the analysis of two bodies of installation works, one of the most up-to-date and hybrid of artistic formats, the researcher has uncovered the reinvention of traditional art and aesthetics and the assertion of cultural identity epitomized in Taiwanese installation art. There are two levels of heterogeneity considered in the study: one is the heterogeneity of style and media consistent with the format of installation works; the other is the heterogeneity of the multicultural aspect of Taiwan.

Carried out by heterogeneous groups formed specifically around issue-based politics, the public debates are purposeful: they emerge from new social movements actively advocating justice and change with respect to their causes. In the three arenas as well as in the formation of the narrative story, expert-activists played an important role. They brought global knowledge into a conversation with local knowledge to form an important discourse with which to resist and change the corporate-government narrative that was firmly entrenched in the industrial region. The most successful activist strategies typically involved alliances: (1) between local citizens and expert-activists, (2) across races and classes, and (3) between local and national organizations. The residents' affiliation with experts led to a strengthening of local allegations regarding their environment and the emergence of a more participatory, democratic, and effective citizen-input process. By grounding expertise in the lives of everyday people who deal with pollution, I believe, following Sandra Harding, that we reach a closer version of reality—what she terms “strong objectivity.” Strong objectivity extends traditional concepts of scientific objectivity by taking into account the underlying agendas and cultures that shaped the science. I use strong objectivity as a lens to examine these citizen-expert alliances and as a test to show why official science, that of corporations and government agencies, is weak at its very foundation. This combination of local knowledge and scientific expertise proved to be a potent hybrid knowledge that has been a catalyst for environmental improvement in the region. Chapters two through five illuminate key tensions in the diverse narratives and interpretations of the issues. Ethnography is my primary methodology. I conducted extensive interviews with local informants, attended numerous public meetings, and referenced public hearing transcripts.

According to contemporary reports, Japan's cities, symbols of the nation's rapid advance into the modern age, harbored a host of miscreant youths—vagrants, thieves, ruffians, idlers, and sexual degenerates—whose presence constituted a malignant growth on the social body. Concerned authorities responded by promoting a national movement to protect Japan's young. This dissertation examines the construction of a modern Japanese discourse on juvenile delinquency, the institutional and non-institutional mechanisms developed to socialize young people deemed at risk, and the actors involved in their creation. Focusing on developments at the national level and in Tokyo, I argue that juvenile protection constituted a crucial channel for the circulation of power and authority in modern Japan. The rhetoric and practice of juvenile protection shifted over the decades covered in this study, but reformers consistently argued that the proper training of youth was the key to mastering the challenges of the modern era and thus to fortifying Japan's position as an industrial, imperialist power in a fiercely competitive international order. In their pursuit of national efficiency, authorities focused on intrusive pedagogical methods that came to be called “lifestyle guidance.” They also sought to mobilize a broad range of actors to police young people and their environments. This process of mobilization constituted a crucial feature of the modern Japanese polity in periods of both peace and war. Juvenile protection programs can by no means be reduced to a set of policies imposed by an oppressive state upon a civil society, or by a “ruling class” on “the people.” Government officials, professionals, social reformers, and local notables cooperated in the construction of a highly interventionist regime of socialization that sought to reconstitute homes, schools, workplaces, and the spaces that connected them. Popular responses to new forms of intervention ranged from willing cooperation to outright resistance. Juvenile protection programs did not always achieve their desired objectives, but they significantly reshaped the everyday lives of an increasingly broad segment of the Japanese population.",304522372,,Dissertations & Theses," Ambaras, David RichardAmbarasRichardDavidAmbaras, David Richard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733511991 , 30477651 , 66569 , 9780599344068 , 0599344067 , 9933638 , 9933638", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599344068 , 0599344067", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304522372?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0582 History"," 0332 History , 0582 History"," 0332 History , 0582 History",," 0332 History , 0582 History", History," Social sciences , Japan , Juvenile delinquency , Mobilization , Socialization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Treasures+of+the+nation%3A+Juvenile+delinquency%2C+socialization%2C+and+mobilization+in+modern+Japan%2C+1895-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ambaras%2C+David+Richard&amp;isbn=9780599344068&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3602,"The reception of George Bernard Shaw in China, 1918-1996","This dissertation examines the reception of G. B. Shaw in China over the past eight decades. Despite changes in political regime, cultural values, official literary policy and aesthetic criteria, Shaw has remained an influential figure in China. His comparatively secure and stable reputation reflects the fact that useful and even kindred qualities in Shaw have often been recognized by Chinese critics and cultural authorities. Significantly, the onset of Shaw's reception in China more or less coincides with the efforts of Chinese reformers to strengthen the country culturally during the early years of this century. Shaw came to be seen as an author whose work (and even life) spoke to the concerns of a new generation of Chinese intellectuals, who tried to use Shaw for their own ends of modernizing their country. My investigation into the ways in which Shaw's work and life were “appropriated” covers four historical moments in modern China when specific social and political conditions made him a special object of interest. These moments are: first, the May Fourth Movement when Shaw's plays substantially affected the radical rethinking of the function of drama in China at this time. Secondly, in 1933, when Shaw paid a visit to Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing at a time of great domestic and international turmoil. As a result, an essentially informal and personal visit turned into a grand political event. Thirdly, the centenary commemoration of Shaw in Beijing in 1956, which was used as a form of socialist propaganda. And, finally, in the post-Mao era, the 1991 stage production of Major Barbara in a prestigious theater in Beijing at a time when great changes were occurring in the reception and evaluation of Shaw's work. The examination of these four highly significant historical moments shows, among other things, how extraliterary elements have exerted a powerful influence on the reading of Shaw in China—with Shaw here serving as a model for the reception of a major Westerner in the context of a non-Western culture that was in the process of redefining itself.",304524483,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, WendiChenWendiChen, Wendi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733933831 , 30394721 , 66569 , 9780599206472 , 0599206470 , 9921427 , 9921427", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599206472 , 0599206470", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304524483?accountid=14496," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0465 Theater , 0295 Comparative literature"," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0465 Theater , 0295 Comparative literature"," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0465 Theater , 0295 Comparative literature",," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0465 Theater , 0295 Comparative literature"," British and Irish literature , Theater , Comparative literature"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , China , Drama , Reception , Shaw, George Bernard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+reception+of+George+Bernard+Shaw+in+China%2C+1918-1996&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Wendi&amp;isbn=9780599206472&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3603,"Toiling in the Empire: Labor in three Anglo-Atlantic ports, London, Philadelphia and Cape Coast Castle, 1750-1783","The importance of the slave trade to the eighteenth-century economic, social and political development of the Atlantic World is an area of great debate. One reason for the debate is that most studies of the slave trade have focused upon the trade's direct participants: the merchants, captains, sailors, slave intermediaries, company officials, plantation owners, overseers and drivers whose primary labor brought them into the trade. This study redirects this ongoing debate by focusing on the missing element of indirect participants. These were the ship builders, coopers, general laborers, porters, watermen, canoemen, tradesmen, manufacturers and others whose labor, while not a direct part of the trade, contributed to the trade. Through an examination of this indirect participation, especially that of laborers, this study reveals new dimensions of the slave trade, showing it to be more extensive than once thought and emphasizing the importance to the slave trade of areas where the actual presence and use of slaves was minimal or absent. Two examples are a London ship carpenter who constructed a vessel that one day carried African slaves from West Africa to the Americas and a textile manufacturer in India whose cloth was included in sortings traded for slaves. By examining the slave trade's indirect participants in London and Cape Coast Castle, this study reveals the large number of laborers whose toil contributed to the slave trade's success and profitability. This study also illustrates how the ability of the direct participants to utilize both unfree and wage labor systems was vital to the trade's success. An understanding of indirect participation strengthens the argument of Philip Curtin and others of the global, not just Atlantic, consequences of the slave trade. Finally, through a review of the secondary literature concerning labor in Philadelphia, this study demonstrates that, in the city where the American abolitionist and revolutionary movements gained great momentum, many of its laborers indirectly contributed to the success of the slave trade.",304527539,,Dissertations & Theses," Reese, Ty MichaelReeseMichaelTyReese, Ty Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729802511 , 30387151 , 66569 , 9780599418301 , 0599418303 , 9940384 , 9940384", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599418301 , 0599418303", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304527539?accountid=14496," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history"," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history"," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history",," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history"," History , African history , American history , European history , Black history"," Social sciences , Cape Coast Castle , England , Ghana , Labor , London , Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Ports , Slave trade",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toiling+in+the+Empire%3A+Labor+in+three+Anglo-Atlantic+ports%2C+London%2C+Philadelphia+and+Cape+Coast+Castle%2C+1750-1783&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reese%2C+Ty+Michael&amp;isbn=9780599418301&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3604,"""Perception, and identity construction between borders"": Normalization within the context of Egyptian tourism to Israel","In an era marked by multinationalism, globalization, transnationalism, and ethnopolitics, the conventional state border appears to be blurring at the edges, and in some instances extending beyond itself, This research seeks to test this proposition for a specific set of borders. Historically, the Egyptian/Israeli border has been among the most rigid borders of the world. Often determined by a display-of-arms, the legally-determined border has shifted dozens of times. From the end of 1993 until early 1996, the existing border was permeated by ‘reciprocal-tourism’. The movement of people, across this particular ‘international borderland’, was symbolically as well as ideologically significant within this sociopolitical locus of world history. This research examines specific “intergroup contact” (Amir 1969) between people from various ethnic groups; within the context of Egyptian tourists or travelers to Israel during this 1993–1996 period. The wider parameters of the study pertain to recent history (post-1948 C.E./Israeli independence), until the present. Situations and changes are addressed regarding the ‘crossing of borders’ between the contemporarily geopolitically defined countries of Israel and Egypt; including the Sinai (administered by Egypt), and areas currently known as Palestine, the West Bank, and Jerusalem (predominately East Jerusalem). Using the peoples identified as tourists, this dissertation tests the proposition that: “international borderlands, at least as expressed by cross-border tourism policy and planning, represent an evolution of borders from formal boundaries to functional regions of ‘connectedness’ ” (Lewis in Richard 1993:602), in the specific case of the nations and inhabitants of contemporary Egypt and Israel. [Tourism broadly defined as traveling for recreation, business, mercantilism, and/or culture (e.g., religion or ideological importance), and, as the management of tourists and the promotion of touring.] This dissertation provides information essential to comprehending how identity is constructed—historically and culturally, within the context of border change, introductory crossings, reciprocity, and documented perceptions. Examining these constructions helps explain how cultural units (particularly state and church), establish social categories and mindsets, and how personal cultural perceptions produce identifiable depictions and presentations. In this particular treatise, Egyptian constructions appear to embitter relations rather than promote the blurring of borders that might lead to regions of connectedness.",304530308,,Dissertations & Theses," Lichtenstein, Loren MichaelsLichtensteinMichaelsLorenLichtenstein, Loren Michaels", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733961611 , 30577161 , 66569 , 9780599260269 , 0599260262 , 9926263 , 9926263", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599260269 , 0599260262", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304530308?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Cultural anthropology , Middle Eastern history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Recreation , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Egyptian , Identity , Israel , Normalization , Tourism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Perception%2C+and+identity+construction+between+borders%22%3A+Normalization+within+the+context+of+Egyptian+tourism+to+Israel&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lichtenstein%2C+Loren+Michaels&amp;isbn=9780599260269&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3605,When Chinese medicine encountered the state: 1910-1949,"The global expansion of Western biomedicine suffered an historic setback in China in the spring of 1929. Since then, the development of medicine in China has deviated from the steady course through which many modern nations have traveled. My dissertation makes three interrelated arguments about this series of events, their historical outcomes, and the impact of their outcomes on the twentieth century history of medicine in China. First, the dissertation argues that in the early twentieth century the expansion of Western medicine in China went hand in hand with the building of the first modern Chinese state. Tracing the history of medical developments in China from the outbreak of the Manchurian Plague in 1910 to the establishment of the first Ministry of Health in 1928, the dissertation examines the historical formation of a symbiotic relationship between the Chinese state and Western medicine in China. Second, the emergence of the modern Chinese state fundamentally transformed the logic of competition between Western-style doctors and traditional Chinese doctors in China, causing them to struggle against each other in the field of the state. In 1929, in the name of Chinese Medical Revolution, Western-style doctors proposed to the Kuomintang state a wholesale abolition of traditional Chinese medicine. The proposal unexpectedly caused the previously unorganized Chinese doctors to establish their first national association, thus mobilizing the National Medicine Movement. Third, the 1929 confrontation constituted an “epistemological event” that led many Chinese doctors both to embrace the discourse of Modernity and begin to “scientize” Chinese medicine on the basis of this discourse. In other words, when Chinese doctors started struggling against Western-styled doctors in the field of the state in the late 1920s, Chinese medicine entered into an entirely new stage of its history. Because Chinese doctors adopted the strategy of assimilating Chinese medicine into the emerging national medical system, their efforts radically transformed the theories, practice and social network of Chinese medicine. In sum, what is now called “traditional Chinese medicine” began to be re-constituted at the moment when Chinese medicine encountered the state.",304542651,,Dissertations & Theses," Lei, Sean Hsiang-linLeiHsiang-linSeanLei, Sean Hsiang-lin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733498321 , 31218691 , 66569 , 9780599324046 , 059932404X , 9934084 , 9934084", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780599324046 , 059932404X", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304542651?accountid=14496," 0585 Science history , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure"," 0585 Science history , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure"," 0585 Science history , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure",," 0585 Science history , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure"," Science history , History , Social structure"," Social sciences , Chinese , Medicine , Modernity , State",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+Chinese+medicine+encountered+the+state%3A+1910-1949&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lei%2C+Sean+Hsiang-lin&amp;isbn=9780599324046&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3606,A critical assessment of the labour law position of farm workers in South Africa,"The aim of this thesis is to investigate the labour law position of South African farm workers. For three and a half centuries farm workers constituted the most neglected group in the South African labour force). Consequently, an understanding of their present position can only be obtained by investigating their labour history. As in other parts of the world, farm workers in South Africa held a subordinate position to agricultural employers. Discrimination against black persons added to the inferior socio-economic and political position of South African farm workers. White farmers occupied a strong political position during most of the time under investigation, which enabled them to institute and apply discriminatory legislation and informal methods to overcome labour shortages. The freedom of movement of black people and their access to land were restricted to create a cheap immobile labour force. During the 20th century farmers prevented the inclusion of farm workers in labour legislation by exercising their political influence. Pressure by industrial trade unions and encouragement by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) resulted in the adoption of the Agricultural Labour Act which made labour legislation applicable to farm workers, but precluded them from striking and made allowance for longer working hours than for industrial workers. The new political dispensation facilitated the inclusion of farm workers in general labour legislation without any discriminatory exceptions and land reform legislation now protects farm workers against arbitrary evictions. A bill of rights furthermore guarantees the rights of farm workers which were previously violated. It would superficially seem that farm workers' problems are something of the past. Farm workers, however, remain handicapped in exercising their new rights by historical factors and circumstances peculiar to the agricultural sector. Legal comparison with Ontario and California confirms that legislation alone is insufficient to empower farm workers. It is recommended that the government amend existing legislation to accommodate the special needs of farm workers and that relevant ILO conventions, especially Convention 141 of 1975, be ratified to, aid the development of unions for farm workers. This will contribute to the empowerment of and social justice for farm workers.",304548387,,Dissertations & Theses," Calitz, Karin BeatrixCalitzBeatrixKarinCalitz, Karin Beatrix", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 731777951 , 30153481 , 66569 , 0801184 , 0801184", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999,, English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304548387?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations"," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations"," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations",," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations"," Law , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Farm workers , Labor law , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+critical+assessment+of+the+labour+law+position+of+farm+workers+in+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Calitz%2C+Karin+Beatrix&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3607,The struggle for a future: Capitalism and beyond,"Drawing upon the richness of twentieth century theorizing, I want to ideologically rearm the proletariat. However, the history of the revolutionary working class is both continuous and discontinuous, and the present discontinuity concerns the other to the mostly male industrial wage-earner who has been the traditional revolutionary subject, the neo-proletariat in Gorz's terms or the other working class in Negri's The situation is far from clear, as alternative revolutionary subjects range from the mostly female global homeworkers to members of informal economies with community currencies, and other elements of the new social movements. Nevertheless, common to them all is some alternative set of values—alternative to the capitalist market place—that I subsume under the ideational rubric of Care. Heidegger's explication of Care is the most theoretically sophisticated effort of the present to define this term. I appropriate this from him for purposes of defining what could be the basic ideational suprastructure of an emerging revolutionary subject—both continuous and discontinuous with the traditional one. I then show the common ground between Heidegger and Marx. Building from that I then consider the arguments of Fredric Jameson, in particular his conception of the totality. Jameson argues, in his ironic and playful way, for the reconception of Marxist praxis based on the evolution and involution of post-modernism, the third age of capitalism. I then consider the traditional socialist concern with planning, separating planning from the drawing up of blueprints. In reference to the work of General Idea, a group of Toronto artists, I then address the question of a war of position. and an early fighter of such a war.

The study sample was chosen by categorizing the Clubhouses by city size, and selecting 14 American and six Canadian Clubs at random with a total of 149 staff, of whom 97 responded, including both frontline staff and executive directors. Respondents completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and a questionnaire which was designed for this study, to measure work-related, worker-related, and client-related predictors of burnout. Burnout scores for this sample matched the scores for Maslach's postsecondary education subgroup most closely and were lower than the scores for her mental health subgroup. No significant differences were found between the Canadian and American samples, and supervisory role appeared to be a significant predictor of burnout levels among staff. These findings suggest that the International Centre for Clubhouse Development should examine how effectively supervisors support their staff, how the model itself may be inhibiting supervisors from doing so, and that staff needs should be incorporated into Clubhouse standards.",304557643,,Dissertations & Theses," Barkley, Tammy LynnBarkleyLynnTammyBarkley, Tammy Lynn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729208831 , 30149091 , 66569 , 9780612551138 , 061255113X , MQ55113 , MQ55113", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9780612551138 , 061255113X", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304557643?accountid=14496," 0347 Mental health , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy"," 0347 Mental health , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy"," 0347 Mental health , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy",," 0347 Mental health , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy"," Mental health , Occupational psychology , Rehabilitation , Therapy"," Health and environmental sciences , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Burnout+and+lack+of+agency+structure%3A++A+study+of+the+Clubhouse+model+of+psychosocial+rehabilitation&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barkley%2C+Tammy+Lynn&amp;isbn=9780612551138&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3609,"Quality of life, motivation and costs in multidisciplinary occupational rehabilitation: A prospective controlled two-year study in patients with prolonged musculoskeletal disorders","Prolonged musculoskeletal disorders (PMSD) are an escalating medical, social and cost problem in the developed countries. The complexity of PMSDs has emphasised the need to develop effective multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes using a holistic approach. The aim of the thesis was to evaluate the outcome of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme focusing on Body Awareness Therapy and cognitive and relaxation treatment, in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQL), working ability and costs, and to obtain a deeper understanding of the process of motivation for change in PMSD patients. Furthermore, predictors of outcome were investigated. A prospective, matched, controlled two-year follow-up study was designed. The rehabilitation group and the control group comprised 122 and 114 patients respectively. The main variables that were measured were HRQL (Nottingham Health Profile, NHP), motivation, body awareness, pain, pain-related medicine consumption, psychosomatic symptoms, working environment, working ability and the patient-specific total cost to society. The cost-effectiveness was expressed as a quotient of the total costs/NHP global score difference value. The results revealed that the following variables were significantly improved in the rehabilitation group as compared with the control group at the two-year follow-up: HRQL ( p = 0.049). emotional reactions ( p = 0.043), pain related to movements ( p = 0.028) and need for pain-related medicines ( p = 0.009). Multivariate regression analyses including all the patients revealed that motivation was a predictor of change in HRQL ( p = 0.001), working ability ( p &lt; 0.001) and costs ( p &lt; 0.001). Motivation for change followed different processes depending on the level at entry to the study. Central themes of importance to the process of motivation were the utilisation of professional networks, emotional support, use of personal coping resources and social support at work. It was confirmed that PMSD patients contribute substantially to the cost to society. However, multidisciplinary rehabilitation improved HRQL more cost-effectively. The relationship in savings in terms of indirect costs between the highly-motivated and the less-motivated patients was calculated at 4:1. It is concluded that the multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme focusing on physiotherapeutic methods improved HRQL to a somewhat greater degree and more cost-effectively than ordinary treatment available within primary care. The patient's motivation could influence outcome and underlines the importance of the interaction between the patient and the health care providers.",304566912,,Dissertations & Theses," Grahn, Birgitta Eva MarianneGrahnEva MarianneBirgittaGrahn, Birgitta Eva Marianne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729734691 , 30146031 , 66569 , 9789162838669 , 9162838660 , C801114 , C801114", Dissertation/Thesis, 1999," 9789162838669 , 9162838660", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304566912?accountid=14496," 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy , 0630 Welfare"," 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy , 0630 Welfare"," 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy , 0630 Welfare",," 0382 Rehabilitation , 0382 Therapy , 0630 Welfare"," Rehabilitation , Therapy , Welfare"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Motivation , Musculoskeletal disorders , Occupational rehabilitation , Quality of life",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Quality+of+life%2C+motivation+and+costs+in+multidisciplinary+occupational+rehabilitation%3A++A+prospective+controlled+two-year+study+in+patients+with+prolonged+musculoskeletal+disorders&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grahn%2C+Birgitta+Eva+Marianne&amp;isbn=9789162838669&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3610,Beyond conflict: The structure and purposes of genocide in the 20th century,"This study sets out to explore the etiology of genocide as a form of conflict. Based on comparison of ten cases (Aché of Paraguay, Ottoman Armenians, Burundi, Bosnia, Cambodia, Herero, Indonesia, Maya, Nazi, and Rwanda), a conflict theory of genocide in the 20 th century is developed, centered around the functions of genocide for the organizers and the structural conditions that enables it to occur. The dissertation includes a substantial write-up of each case and concludes with ideas for genocide transformation. It is argued that genocide is inherently a political phenomenon; it is ‘about’ obtaining and maximizing power and control. Genocide is functionally useful for regime consolidation (establishing hegemony), regime expansion (forcible incorporation of new resources), and regime maintenance (eliminating threat). Distinctions are made between the intent of the perpetrator (genocide as instrumental tactic versus integral goal) and primary motives (political, economic, strategic). The perpetrators assume the power to define and choose their victims, who are typically seen as either active or implicit communities of resistance . They are perceived as either an ‘ existential threat ’ to the safety and well-being of the regime's constituency or as a‘ strategic obstacle ’ that must be eliminated to achieve the regime's ideal. Each case was studied systematically to ascertain the existence and relative salience of 38 pre-identified factors and to identify other patterns in the dynamics and structure of genocide within and across cases. These factors comprise situational characteristics (economic and social stress), historical factors, group identity and ideological characteristics, positional dynamics in the victim/perpetrator relationship, political and regime factors, strategic factors, and international relations characteristics. Regime characteristics are identified as the primary causal factors in genocide. The other factors are significant in: ( a ) enabling the emergence of a genocidal regime; ( b ) supporting the mobilization of a genocidal movement; ( c ) facilitating implementation of a genocidal plan. These form the genocidal calculus : the factors that accelerate the motivation and potential success of genocide in the perpetrator's calculations, countered by the factors that decelerate its development. An activist approach to genocide transformation is advocated based on addressing the needs for recognition, justice, political transformation, development, and reconciliation.",304567124,,Dissertations & Theses," Barnes, Mary CatherineBarnesCatherineMaryBarnes, Mary Catherine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

With the development of foreign affairs with the outside world, there appeared a diplomatic group specializing in foreign affairs in the Qing Dynasty authorieties. The personnel in the diplomatic group were the pioneers who contacted the Western society and the rest of the world for the interest of China with a weak diplomacy. Their personal experience in the expansion of western learning in China, and their changes of mind and ideology, are the subjects that deserve investigation and research. For the time being, little research is carried out about these diplomats especially about the diplomatic group, of the late Qing Dynasty. This thesis will do some research in three aspects of the diplomaly of the Late Qing Dynasty.First of all, the formation process on the modern diplomacy as well as its working mechanism. From 1861 to 1875, the Qing Dynasty finally began its construction of modem diplomacy in 1875 after years' preparations and experimentation. At the beginning, the Qing government put an emphasis on the social status and attitudes of diplomats in choosing them for the purpose of avoiding"" changing China through foreignness"" and only high officials with good academic fame were chosen. But later on, due to the actual demands, a variety of officials were chosen to be sent to other countries. As far as the officials themselves, there were roughly three motivations: 1, to understand the western society by means of being a diplomat in another country, such as Guo Song-tao, Xue Fu-cheng and Zeng Ji-ze; 2, to make a new turn in the officialdom through travelling to other countries, such as Chen Lanbin, Cui Guo-yin; 3,to make it as a shortcut to fame and office, such as Li Feng-bao, 2hang Yin-huang.Secondly, the experience and ideological change of diplomats. In accordance with the notebooks, memoirs, official letters and records of the diplomats, the thesis treats of their knowledge about foreign countries, they had different ways of life in foreign countries because of the varieties of personal experiences and motivations, thus their contacts and attention were quite different as well as their viewpoints to problems. However, they had some common topics as a whole, one was the difference between Chinese and western cultures, the other was the source of the powerfulness of a country. Therefore, there are four changes which deserve our attention: 1, the change from westernization to modernization; 2, less emphasis on the loyalty to the Qing Dynasty; 3, mutiple-viewpoints to treat of the difference between Chinese and werstern cultures; 4, realization of the disadvantageous position on China in the world.Thirdly, the role which the diplomats played in the process of expansion of western learning in China. The thesis points out that they made the main contributions as follows: 1, to restore the state sourveignty through the new knowledge they learned, in this respem the outstanding representatives are Zeng Ji-ze, Xue Fu-ceng, Yang Ru, especially Zeng Ji-ze who made a remarkable success in dealing with Russian authorities by means of international public laws as well as international situation knowledge; 2, to take an active part in the modernization to strengthen the social change of China, especially the direct work by Zhang Yin-huan and Huang Zun-xian in the famous Reformation of 1898;3,to actively advocate the movement to understand the western society and accelerate the exchange between China and the western society, for example, Zeng Ji-ze once led an Imperial Academic travelling activity. In the early expansion of western learning, the diplomats as the native excellent intellectuals, described their personal travelling experiences to persuade the countrymen; in the introduction of western culture, they imported western advance dequippment and technology as well as western academic culture. 4, to push and perfect the construction of modem diplomacy, including the training of the diplomats and the construction of embassy through the efforts of the first generation of diplomats.To conclude, the thesis makes it clear: as the pioneers of leading China to the outside world, the diplomats before the Sino-Japanese War cultivated the active reformation factors in the Qing Dynasty with their special experience to push the process of China's modernization to some degree, especially some excellent intellectuals of them who proved that the Chinese culture itself possessed the reformative and advancing force and power.",1024718796, 甲午之前的晚清驻外使节与西学,Dissertations & Theses," Lin, QiongLinQiongLin, Qiong林琼", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709664241 , 70431062 , 189128 , H027507 , H027507", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, Chinese, Chinese, 甲午之前的晚清驻外使节与西学,2000,PQDT - Global,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024718796?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH027507 , Social sciences , 中国 , 外交史 , 文化传播 , 晚清 , 自由词 , 驻外使节",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+diplomacy+of+Late+Qing+Dynasty+and+Western+Learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lin%2C+Qiong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3613,World Order:Structures and Mechanisms,"On the basis of former macroscopically studies on the development of world order, this dissertation tries to further the studies from a microcosmic angle. It takes world order as a special system, and the deve1opment of world order as a self-organized process of the world order system, by which the author will explore the inherent mechanisms and genera1 laws of world order evolution. World order is a Stab1e, peaceful, and well-organized situation that relies on the balance of power. This situation is always streamlined during the process of intercourse among different intemationa1 relations actors under certain rules, norms and regimes. World order, thus, can be regarded as a system with special internal structure that is formed and changed historically by international relations actors' practice. The structure of world order regularly consists of four fundamental elements: actors, objects, aims, and means. The different configurations of those elements constitute various world order models. As the external appearance of world order system, the basic models of world order mainly include balance of power model and hegemony stability model, which are initiated by realists, collective security model and world government. Model, which are developed by liberalizes and idealists. Se1f-organizaton is the intrinsic mechanism of every system's evolution. The development of world order, which is a special social system in the context of the whole human society, is not exceptional either The development of world order is always started by continual stimulation of outside information and driven by inside movements of rise and fall. The process of self-organization and acclimatization can be usually divided into two steps or sub-forms of movement: assimilation self-organization and acclimatization self-organization. The world order system evolves constantly from assimilation to acclimatization, and then from acclimatization to assimilation, by which the world order system begins another process of deve1opment. Simultaneously, the world order system itself undergoes stability and instability circularly. These circulatory movements will never stop. And each new round of circle wil1 bring the new development of world order to a higher level. This is the general law of self-organizational evolution of the world order system. The evolution of the world order, being driven by intrinsic contradictions is the embodiment of the law of the unity of opposites. The evolution of world order from assimilation to acclimatization and then to new assimilation embraces the law of the transition of qualitative change and quantitative change. And the circulatory evolution of world order from stability to instability and to stability again practices the law of double negations. Just as the development law of any other things in the world, the development law of world order is also objective, stable, universal, and recurrent. Subsequently, the evolution of world order should be seen as both the unity of intermittence and continuity and the unity of recurrence and renewa1. In the history the evolution of real world orders followed strictly the general law of the development of world order. Westphalia order, which is accepted as the first true world order with universal implications, Vienna order, Versailles order, and Yalta order represent the most important stable phases in the evolution of the world order system. The period between every two world order phases happens to be the intermission or transition in the development of world order development, during which the whole world experienced the process of instability. As regards to the future new world order facing the 2l century various theories and models have been proposed. However, according to the general law of the development of world order, this dissertation infers that the most possible new world order will be a new multiplier balance of power formed by five major great powers the United States, Europe, Russia, Japan, and China.",1027141842, 世界秩序：结构与机制,Dissertations & Theses," Pan, Qi ZhongPanZhongQiPan, Qi Zhong潘忠岐", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2716321291 , 70392582 , 189128 , H004730 , H004730", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, Chinese, Chinese, 世界秩序：结构与机制,2000,PQDT - Global,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027141842?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAIH004730 , Social sciences , 世界秩序 , 国际秩序 , 自由词",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=World+Order%3AStructures+and+Mechanisms&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pan%2C+Qi+Zhong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3614,Catherine bauer 1928-1935: from modernism and housing to action,"Housing expert and city planner Catherine Bauer Wurster (1905-64) was, in 1929, introduced to Lewis Mumford. In 1930 Bauer sailed to Europe to study modern architecture. She attended the Die Frankfurter Kurse für Bauen and learned about social, technical, and economic approaches to housing. She came away convinced that an entirely new kind of human environment was not only possible but inevitable. In New York she wrote an article praising social housing in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1932, Bauer travelled to Europe with Mumford, to collect information about housing communities. That summer she decided to write Modern Housing (1934). The dissertation positions the contribution of Modern Housing in the modernist canon while focusing also on the place occupied by Modern Housing in the broader framework of thought about architecture and housing. The dissertation examines the conjunction of aesthetic and social ideas Bauer found in modern architecture. It attributes to her a ""moral imagination"" to show her thoughts about modernism housing and action. Hitchcock and Johnson's The International Style (1932) is unique in the unchallenged position it has held in the story of modernism coming to America, a text which post-war accounts criticized for having failed to address certain perennial issues definitive to modernism itself. A recent conference challenging the idea of an avant garde in America questioned the "" motivations of practitioners of the avant-garde in America and the extent to which they were interested in form rather than in the philosophical, political, and economic underpinnings of the European movement"". In this recent rethinking the significance of Modern Housing began to crystallize. To chart the arrival of modernism in America and acknowledge a deeper understanding of The International Style , it must be recognized that Modern Housing was conceived of and designed as a companion text, and that Modern Housing was written from an identifiable position within the 1930s debate.",1811926264,,Dissertations & Theses," Rikala, Taina MarjattaRikalaMarjattaTainaRikala, Taina Marjatta", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4148820601 , 102354372 , 101309 , U148042 , U148042", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, English, English,,2000,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811926264?accountid=14496, 0729 Architecture, 0729 Architecture, 0729 Architecture, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0729 Architecture, Architecture," (UMI)AAIU148042 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Catherine+bauer+1928-1935%3A+from+modernism+and+housing+to+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rikala%2C+Taina+Marjatta&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3615,The cry for justice in Nigeria: A look at MOSOP and the effectiveness of its nonviolent tactics,"The Ogoni people, a minority ethnic group of Rivers State in the South East of Nigeria are about 500,000 in number. One of their grievances is that despite the fact that the bulk of oil derived from their environment has become Nigeria's main source of revenue, they have been neglected and marginalized. Such economic, political and social deprivations enraged the Ogoni people hence the formation of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) and their uprising in the early 1990s. In its conflict with both the Nigerian government and international oil corporations, MOSOP adopted the following tactics: dialogue, writing of petition letters, direct contacts with the Nigerian government and oil companies, public criticism of government policies and/or actions, massive street protests, civil disobedience, organized seminars, political rallies, meetings, press conferences and campaigns, circulation of posters with the inscription ‘Ogoni Freedom Campaign’, Ogoni songs, television comedies, poems about the Ogoni situation, hunger strike, naming of streets after the executed Ogoni nine and candle light procession. The effectiveness of these ‘repertoire of actions’ in MOSOP's demand for political autonomy and control/fair use of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni development, constituted the central focus of this study. The concept of political process theory i.e. the dimensions of the political environment that provide incentive(s) for people to mobilize/undertake collective action, was used as the analytical tool. Among others, the political opportunity structure helped in understanding the division among and within the existing and emerging Nigerian elite as well as the crucial roles played by the influential allies in Ogoni crises.",250809158,,Dissertations & Theses," Adodo, Imondu M.AdodoM.ImonduAdodo, Imondu M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729262611 , 19257391 , 66569 , 9780493196626 , 0493196625 , 1404072 , 1404072", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780493196626 , 0493196625", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250809158?accountid=14496," 0617 Public administration , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0331 African history"," 0617 Public administration , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0331 African history"," 0617 Public administration , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0331 African history",," 0617 Public administration , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0331 African history"," Public administration , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Social structure , African history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+cry+for+justice+in+Nigeria%3A++A+look+at+MOSOP+and+the+effectiveness+of+its+nonviolent+tactics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Adodo%2C+Imondu+M.&amp;isbn=9780493196626&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3616,The origins of the Chinese Communist Party and the role played by Soviet Russia and the Comintern (BL),"In making a comprehensive survey of the international background of the foundation of the CCP, the author proposes that the establishment of the CCP was a part of the Bolsheviks' global strategy of world revolution, of the Comintern's efforts to expand Communist forces into the East; it also served Soviet Russia's interest in the Far East. The study reveals the important role that Soviet Russia and the Comintern played in the establishment of the CCP. During the period 1918-1921, Soviet Russia and the Comintern dispatched numerous emissaries to China and recruited many agents there. These people made wide-ranging contacts with Chinese in different organisations and factions regardless of their political beliefs, party affiliation or social strata. They conducted intensive agitation and propaganda by various media and means, including supplying news and publicity to the press free of charge and publishing Communist booklets and journals in Chinese. They had a hand in directing important student and worker organisations which emerged during the May Fourth Movement, and later urged people who had a little knowledge of Marxism and who belonged to anarchist organisations and the Guomindang to organise socialist and communist organisations and parties. The CCP's important founders, Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu's conversion to Bolshevism and their creation of the CCP only happened after the Bolshevik agents' persuasion and instruction. Therefore, the thesis concludes that the establishment of CCP was not, as official ideologists claim, the outcome of the combination of the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism and the labour movement in China, but actually the result of political direction and financial support by the Bolsheviks. In consequence, the CCP was built along Leninist lines from the very beginning. This research further analyses the internal causes allowing Bolshevism to be transplanted into China and points out that the ideology which the CCP embraced during its founding period still has far-reaching influence upon politics in China today.",301555947,,Dissertations & Theses," Jianyi, L.JianyiL.Jianyi, L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1758230461 , 44803891 , 101309 , U132995 , U132995", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, English, English,,2000,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301555947?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU132995 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+origins+of+the+Chinese+Communist+Party+and+the+role+played+by+Soviet+Russia+and+the+Comintern+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jianyi%2C+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3617,"Comparing the Basque diaspora: Ethnonationalism, transnationalism and identity maintenance in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Peru, the United States of America, and Uruguay","Through a comparison of Basque diaspora populations in six countries, this thesis describes and analyzes ethnicity maintenance, transnational consciousness, and ethnonational tendencies of self-defining Basques. I argue that despite geographical and generational differences, the core elements of Basque identity are defined in a constant manner, and ethnic institutions have developed according to similar patterns. I categorize these populations as 'diaspora' utilizing Cohen's definition, and give examples of their (1) traumatic dispersal from an original homeland; (2) expansion from the homeland in pursuit of colonial ambitions, trade, or work; (3) shared myth and collective memory of their homeland; (4) idealization of their homeland; (5) return movement; (6) sustained strong ethnic group consciousness; (7) sense of solidarity with co-ethnic members in other countries; and (8) distinctive and enriched lives in tolerant host countries. I suggest chain migration and consistent interaction with the homeland have strengthened transnational ties and diasporic consciousness. Contemporary relations between Basque diaspora communities and the Basque Government have fomented and reinvigorated ethnicity maintenance for many from the thirty-eight Basque associations represented. Tajfel's 'positive social identity' theory aids in partially explaining ethnic identity preservation in Uruguay, Argentina and some areas of the United States, though respondents in Australia, Peru, and Belgium tend to employ primordialist vocabulary to interpret their persistent ethnonationalism. While homeland definitions of ""Basqueness"" have progressed to a more civic and inclusive nationalism, diaspora definitions tend to follow the traditional conservativism of Sabino Arana and ancestry, language, and religion. A multimethod approach creates original quantitative and qualitative data from 832 written anonymous questionnaires and 348 personal interviews.

The thesis focuses on Moroccan migrant women's lived experiences of transnationalism between Morocco and Italy. In particular, it explores the ways in which Moroccan women's transnational social, economic and symbolic activities affect identity narratives and cultural renegotiation processes. Scholars of transnationalism are debating the interpretation of this phenomenon. Some conceive of transnationalism as a domain of resistance to economic marginalisation and to nation-states' power, others maintain that migrants' transnationalism is, by and large, reflection and outcome of processes of global economic restructuring on sending and receiving societies. This dissertation argues that, as migration, transnationalism is not a homogeneous process that could be universally defined. The articulation of gender relationships with contextual structural local and national factors and individuals' agencies produce differentiated narratives and strategies of transnationalism. The focus on migrant women highlights a specific type of embeddedness within nation-states' hegemony and a different experience of transnationalism from that of their male counterparts. Women's movements and activities are conditioned by a set of normative and cultural regulations based upon hegemonic interpretations of gender roles which both in Morocco and Italy condition their activities, their identities and their likelihood of either moving across countries or staying put. At the same time, however, as well as embodying dominant constructions and structures, women develop a dialectical relationship with them, producing in some cases counterhegemonic discourses or challenging expected behaviour. Whereas most accounts of transnationalism emphasise the economic and political relations of migrants with their countries of origin, this work investigates the cultural and symbolic significance of women's practices within and between Italy and Morocco. In particular, it explores how notions of ""modernity"", ""tradition"" and ""authenticity"" are articulated with migrant women's construction of cultural and religious identities in a context of movement and increasing interconnections. The third section of the thesis provides a picture of the ways in which migrant women are represented and constructed within the national contexts (especially Italy). The politics of ""integration"", notably in the form of respect for cultural difference, rights to citizenship and to resource redistribution, constitutes the structural framework that shapes the nature and quality of transnational practices.",301582406,,Dissertations & Theses," Salih, R.SalihR.Salih, R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1758148341 , 44783091 , 101309 , U119022 , U119022", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, English, English,,2000,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301582406?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAIU119022 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+lives%2C+plurinational+subjects%3A+identity%2C+migration+and+difference+among+Moroccan+women+in+Italy+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Salih%2C+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3619,"The implantation of the Plymouth Brethren in Spain, 1869-1936.","The history of modern Protestantism in Spain began in earnest in the seven years following the 1868 'Glorious Revolution'. As political and religious changes unfolded, Protestant missionaries from Europe and the United States descended upon Spain and worked without any significant hindrance until 1875, the year that the Bourbons regained the throne under Alfonso XII. Missionaries came from Baptist, Methodist, Anglican and Reformed Churches. However, the denomination that consistently sent the greatest number of missionaries was the British Plymouth Brethren; Protestantism in Spain has been more influenced by them than by any other confession. From their beginning in the 1820s, the Brethren were shaped theologically by the Dispensationalism of John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) and guided missiologically by Anthony Norris Groves (1795-1853), the first Brethren missionary who served in Asia. Subsequent Brethren leaders such as George Müller (1805-1898) and Robert Chapman (1803-1902) kept the Brethren's focus on missions, and particularly, on Spain. Their influence, as well as cultural and religious debates taking place in the international arena, solidified Spain as a primary field that consistently received more Brethren funds and volunteers than any other country where their missionaries laboured. Centres of operation were established in Madrid, Barcelona, and in Galicia. In spite of their relatively large investment, few conversions of Spaniards were recorded from 1869 to 1936, the year when the Spanish Civil War began and, most Protestant missionaries were forced to flee Spain. Their inability to adapt their message to Spain was hindered by paternalistic approaches to missions and continued resistance to the contextualisation of their theology. With the Bourbons and nationalistic Roman Catholicism re-established in 1875, the Brethren were practically excluded from significant involvement in any public process.

Pre-registration nursing curricula have been designed purporting to incorporate health promotion principles. In the United Kingdom this change in nursing education has been called Project 2000. Empirical evidence in the United Kingdom suggests that nurses perceive health promotion from an individualistic biomedical perspective. Chapters 1- 4 explore the philosophical and social origins of the concept. It is argued that this is evolutionary, rooted in health education, derived from ancient Greek philosophy. The development of health promotion theory and application to nursing is examined through the development of nursing theory in the United States. Critical comparisons are made by review of national and international literature relating to the focus of health promotion in nursing. Chapters 5-11 contain the main body of the thesis. Three longitudinal case studies investigate Project 2000 nursing student's perceptions of the concept. Three intentions aim to determine the students' health beliefs and values of health promotion on entry to nursing, to establish if any changes in their perceptions of health promotion could be attributed to the philosophical shift from intervention to prevention in nurse education and healthcare generally, and finally to develop an instrument to be used to measure changes in perception as part of curriculum evaluation. The results of the study are reported and contextualised by the influence of teachers, the curriculum and the climate of change in healthcare at that time. The properties of the instrument and the implications for its purpose are addressed. Weaknesses in the design of the strategy are examined. The thesis concludes with a review of the evidence presented. More recent conceptual development is examined. Final conclusions lead to recommendations for further refinement of the instrument, by development of psychometric properties.",301602208,,Dissertations & Theses," Vernon, LesleyVernonLesleyVernon, Lesley", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1758945381 , 44809301 , 101309 , U137916 , U137916 , http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/5547", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, English, English,,2000,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301602208?accountid=14496, 0745 Higher education, 0745 Higher education, 0745 Higher education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0745 Higher education, Higher education," http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/5547 , (UMI)AAIU137916 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nursing+and+health+promotion%3A+an+exploration+of+pre-registration+nursing+students%27+perceptions+of+the+concept&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vernon%2C+Lesley&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3621,“Red Waters”: Contesting marine space as Indian place in the United States Pacific Northwest,"This study investigates the social construction of race, marine space, and resource conflict in one U.S. Native American community: the Makah Reservation, Neah Bay, Washington. A combination of archival records, news media coverage, and semistructured interviews is employed in order to expose the historic roots of the Makah Tribe’s recent movement to reclaim control over traditional marine spaces. In particular, this research focuses on the gray whale controversy period between 1995–2000, when, to the consternation of conservation non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Makahs organized to resume a limited, cultural based harvest of the California gray whale in Pacific waters. This paper suggests that extant conflicts which developed between the Makah people, on one hand, and anti-whaling NGOs on another, were as much a struggle over marine space as they were a struggle over gray whale resources. Three central conclusions are drawn from the study. First, it is shown that Pacific marine “space” serves as a distinct, historical territory upon which many of the Makahs’ political, cultural, and economic processes take form. Second, this research argues that NGO efforts to arrest the Makahs’ contemporary whale harvest in offshore Pacific waters have been interpreted by tribal members as a neocolonialist invasion into what was once customarily managed marine space. Third, these results show how, despite the dominance of anti-whaling NGOs, Makahs have effectively mobilized global media technologies in order to empower themselves politically, transcend the territorial boundaries of the reservation, and reclaim control over the marine environment.",304578684,,Dissertations & Theses," Barton, Karen SamanthaBartonSamanthaKarenBarton, Karen Samantha", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728379501 , 19238051 , 66569 , 9780599996786 , 0599996781 , 9992127 , 9992127", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599996786 , 0599996781", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304578684?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Geography , Cultural anthropology , American studies , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cultural survival , Makah Reservation , Marine space , Native Americans , Treaty rights , Washington",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CRed+Waters%E2%80%9D%3A++Contesting+marine+space+as+Indian%0Aplace+in+the+United+States+Pacific+Northwest&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barton%2C+Karen+Samantha&amp;isbn=9780599996786&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3622,Transforming Los Angeles: Black and Japanese American struggles for racial equality in the 20th century,"Over the course of the 20th century, exponential economic and population growth transformed Los Angeles into a global city with a multi-ethnic population. Racial and ethnic diversity were the product of the capitalist economy's increased reliance on non-white labor and the efforts of communities of color to carve out a space for themselves in the city. Race and class interacted in the construction of a structure of inequality that was produced and reproduced not simply by hierarchichal relations of production but through residential segregation and through a contestation over urban space. Prior to World War II, the Japanese American and African American communities remained predominantly under the leadership of ethnic elites, who subscribed to the philosophy racial uplift. In response to the segregation produced during the suburbanization of the city, middle-class ethnic leaders promoted the idea of housing “improvement” to distinguish themselves from their less fortunate brethren and improve relations with whites. However, white resistance to integration, limited the effectiveness of the “improvement” strategy. Struggles for racial progress through employment generated broader participation. The general rejection of minorities by organized labor pushed Japanese American workers to greater dependence on the ethnic economy, while African Americans were moved to mass political action for public sector and defenese-industry employment. It was only with the dramatic emergence of social movement unionism in the CIO during World War II that the fight for racial equality became integral to organized labor. However, the unity that made the wartime advances possible dissipated under the pressure of Cold War politics. While the social conditions of black and Japanese Americans diverged considerably in the postwar era, community leaders united behind an integrationist agenda. Integrationists achieved success in breaking down discriminatory legal barriers but ultimately failed to dismantle the structural bases of inequality. The pent-up frustration caused by concentrated poverty and segregation exploded in the Watts Rebellion. Japanese Americans came to be identified as a “model minority,” whose acceptance into the middle-class validated mainstream society's claim to being “colorblind” while signifying that the hardship of blacks was self-produced.",304581774,,Dissertations & Theses," Kurashige, Scott TadaoKurashigeTadaoScottKurashige, Scott Tadao", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727709811 , 19230831 , 66569 , 9780599850781 , 0599850787 , 9979064 , 9979064", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599850781 , 0599850787", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304581774?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American history , Black history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Black struggle , California , Japanese-American , Los Angeles , Racial equality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+Los+Angeles%3A++Black+and+Japanese+American+struggles+for+racial+equality+in+the+20th+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kurashige%2C+Scott+Tadao&amp;isbn=9780599850781&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3623,"“The people like melée”: The Parang Festival of Carriacou, Grenada","The Parang Festival is produced annually on the small Caribbean island of Carriacou (Grenada). Spanning the weekend prior to Christmas, the Festival is organized by a local community group—the Mount Royal Progressive Youth Movement—which uses revenues generated by the event to assist Carriacouans in need via charitable giving. While the overall intent of the Parang Festival is to preserve traditional Carriacouan music, song, and dance, the event is itself a study of the changing meaning and significance of these forms as they are recontextualized from community-based folk genres to staged competition performances. Born in an era of political upheaval, the Parang Festival was ideologically linked to the 1979 Grenadian Socialist Revolution and served, in part, as a means of cultural decolonization for Carriacou's population. This dissertation examines the cultural transformation of the population of Carriacou through an analysis of the Parang Festival using four vantage points: (1) the historical (primarily the 1950s through the years surrounding the Socialist Revolution); (2) via ethnographies of the festival's component parts, including string band music, Hosannah bands ( a cappella carol singing), and non-competitive performances of quadrille dance and music; (3) through an examination of the Parang Festival as a vehicle for this small society to articulate social mores and values as well as negotiate issues pertaining to cultural autonomy and regional belonging; and (4) via an analysis of what I term “cultural ambivalence” by Carriacouans towards the contemporary practice of certain creolized genres, particularly quadrille music and dance. This dissertation shows how the performance practice and meaning of the island's traditional expressive culture was affected by the politics of the late 1970s and how it continues to change in response to Carriacou's emergence into the global process of modernization. I analyze how this process is tempered by the economic neglect wrought by Carriacou's years of “double dependency” status, that is, as a dependency of a former colony (Grenada). I show how this historically fragile economy has resulted in the development of a culture of community self-help (as exemplified by the Parang Festival), one based on reciprocity, volunteerism, and cycles of giving.",304586439,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, Rebecca SusanMillerSusanRebeccaMiller, Rebecca Susan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727774041 , 31864361 , 66569 , 9780599941748 , 059994174X , 9987814 , 9987814", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599941748 , 059994174X", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304586439?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0358 Folklore"," 0413 Music , 0358 Folklore"," 0413 Music , 0358 Folklore",," 0413 Music , 0358 Folklore"," Music , Folklore"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Carriacou , Dance , Grenada , Parang Festival , Quadrille",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CThe+people+like+mel%C3%A9e%E2%80%9D%3A++The+Parang+Festival+of+Carriacou%2C+Grenada&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Rebecca+Susan&amp;isbn=9780599941748&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3624,"“To be Quechua is to belong”: Citizenship, identity, and intercultural bilingual education in Cuzco, Peru","This dissertation explores the conflict surrounding discussions about indigenous rights, ethnicity, and citizenship in the Southern Peruvian highlands as a way to explore recent changes in the way these concepts are understood and lived in Peru. After almost twenty years of political violence in Peru, a group of activists and intellectuals emerged in the 1990s and—like indigenous leaders throughout Latin America—demanded government recognition of Peruvian indigenous peoples and of Peru as a multicultural, multiethnic nation. In neighboring Andean countries indigenous movements have acquired increasing political prominence, while in Peru, there is still no national indigenous organization in the highlands. Peruvian activists, through the development and implementation of intercultural bilingual education programs in the highlands, are attempting to promote indigenous Quechua identity among highland peoples in an effort to establish a national highland indigenous organization in the country. Drawing on more than a year of ethnographic fieldwork in Cuzco, Peru, this study examines the clash between Peruvian activists and their initiatives at education reform, and the indigenous Quechua peoples for whom they claim to work and represent, who are strongly opposed to the implementation of bilingual education in their children's schools. This project also looks at the relationship between the state, through its involvement in education and language policy changes, and international agents—such as UNESCO and UNICEF—closely linked to the elaboration of alternative education programs aimed at social development among indigenous sectors of the population. Theoretically, this dissertation concentrates on the way ethnicity—particularly indigenous ethnicity—is currently being rethought by activists, state agents, and Quechuas themselves. Moreover, it highlights the mobilization of changing ethnic and cultural identity labels in the region. Ultimately, this work shows that the mobilization of ethnicity in Peru is a first step toward the achievement of indigenous autonomy and the recognition of indigenous Peruvians as full citizens.",304587576,,Dissertations & Theses," Garcia, Maria ElenaGarciaElenaMariaGarcia, Maria Elena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727947761 , 31863581 , 66569 , 9780493160368 , 0493160361 , 3006725 , 3006725", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780493160368 , 0493160361", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304587576?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education"," Cultural anthropology , Bilingual education , Multicultural education"," Social sciences , Education , Citizenship , Cuzco , Identity , Intercultural bilingual education , Peru , Quechua",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CTo+be+Quechua+is+to+belong%E2%80%9D%3A++Citizenship%2C+identity%2C+and+intercultural+bilingual+education+in+Cuzco%2C+Peru&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garcia%2C+Maria+Elena&amp;isbn=9780493160368&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3625,"Controlling births, policing sexualities: A history of birth control in colonial India, 1877–1946","My dissertation examines the history of birth control in colonial India, locating this history at the nexus of a complex web of local, nationalist, and international initiatives. In tracing the intellectual, political and social genealogy of birth control in colonial India, my work allows for a more complex understanding of this issue, providing historical context to the existing scholarship and debates on birth control in India as well as in other parts of the world. Moreover, by analyzing the oppressive and ill-liberal historical trajectory of birth control in colonial India, this study has forced me to rethink and re-evaluate my own underlying liberal feminist assumptions, linking birth control unproblematically with expressions of individualism, progress and development. From the late nineteenth century onwards numerous intellectual traditions influenced the discussions on India's population and its health. The debates on population size and health of the people generated a demand for wider dissemination of contraceptive information. Important intellectual currents that framed the discourse on birth control in colonial India were Malthusianism, eugenics, demography, western bio-medical discourse and sexology. In mapping the trajectory of the birth control movement in India, this work interrogates the influence of these intellectual traditions on the work of Indian advocates. The historical specificities of colonialism, bourgeois nationalism and middle class feminist politics are important political impulses within which these debates are located. Although many advocates of birth control aimed to liberate women from their biological destiny, theoretically, a closer examination of the history of birth control in colonial India demonstrates that the concern with liberating women and ensuring better reproductive health facilities to Indian women were not guiding principles in these early debates on birth control. Politics of gender, class, caste, race, community and nation shaped the discourse of birth control in colonial India. This study investigates how these multiple variables intersected to produce a hegemonic and oppressive politics of birth control.",304588630,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahluwalia, SanjamAhluwaliaSanjamAhluwalia, Sanjam", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727897981 , 32081701 , 66569 , 9780493072548 , 0493072543 , 9999183 , 9999183", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780493072548 , 0493072543", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304588630?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies"," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies"," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies",," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies"," History , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Birth control , Colonial , India , Sexualities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Controlling+births%2C+policing+sexualities%3A++A+history+of+birth+control+in+colonial+India%2C+1877%E2%80%931946&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahluwalia%2C+Sanjam&amp;isbn=9780493072548&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3626,"Between sacrifice and desire: Gender, media and national identity in Vietnam","The post Cold-War era has given rise to new forms of nationalism. In Europe, the demise of the Soviet Union has provoked the fissure of nation-states into warring national groups divided by ethnic, religious, linguistic or other identities. In socialist Asia, in contrast, the politically-entrenched Party-states have redirected and recast the discourses of nationalism from the priorities of anti-imperialist class struggle to the often-conflicting goals of global economic inclusion and national cultural strengthening. These projects of modern national re-‘imagining’ carry distinct gender and class consequences, as certain human qualities and social groups are singled out as more authentically ‘national’ and globally ‘fit’ than others. This dissertation examines the gender politics of market transition and national cultural construction in 1990s Vietnam. Throughout Vietnam's embattled modern history, the Vietnamese woman has provided the coding for the complex and contradictory terms of national ‘tradition’ and ‘progress’. In the movement from a war-oriented, socialist command economy to a nascent market system, the focus of state pedagogy has shifted from the inculcation of “progressive” norms of heroic sacrifice and collective production to the cultivation of economically self-sufficient and law-abiding middle class families. These new governmental priorities have entailed a re-traditionalization of the terms of national femininity, as women's domestic roles, talents and traditions have become the key ingredients in the promotion of “happy”, “civilized” and morally sound households. The popular media contributes to the domestic disciplining of women through the marketing of “real life” family stories that problematize women's income earning ambitions and police the normative boundaries of female agency and desire. This study draws on formal and informal interview data to explore the constraints of national discourses of femininity on the identity practices of Vietnamese women in two distinct class settings of urban Hanoi. The re-domestication of national feminine norms has carried the heaviest moral consequences for a generation of women caught between the socialist education of their youth and the economic pressures of the new market era. Women's discursive practices of complaint, contestation and parody are analyzed as complex enactments of their confinement in a field of irreconcilable gender demands.",304589327,,Dissertations & Theses," Pettus, Ashley StonePettusStoneAshleyPettus, Ashley Stone", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728322821 , 31605121 , 66569 , 9780599860421 , 0599860421 , 9979766 , 9979766", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599860421 , 0599860421", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304589327?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass media"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass media"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass media",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass media"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Gender , Media , National identity , Vietnam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+sacrifice+and+desire%3A++Gender%2C+media+and+national+identity+in+Vietnam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pettus%2C+Ashley+Stone&amp;isbn=9780599860421&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3627,Five smooth stones: Strategic capacity in the unionization of California agriculture,"The story of David and Goliath poses a question about which many remain intensely curious: under what conditions can the resourcefulness of an underdog overcome the institutionalized resources of the powerful? One instance that offers insight into that question is the United Farm Workers' victory over the California growers in the labor struggles of the 1960s and 1970s. Despite recurrent opportunities since 1900, repeated attempts to unionize California agriculture had failed. Early in the 1960s, three organizations made another attempt: the AFL-CIO's Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the independent United Farm Workers. In the spring of 1966, however, it was neither the powerful Teamsters nor the AFL-CIO that won the first breakthrough, but the upstart United Farm Workers led by Cesar Chavez. Most explanations of such events argue that the “time for change was right” or attribute success to the intervention of gifted charismatic individuals. Jenkins and Perrow's 1977 social movement classic, Insurgency of the Powerless , attributes the UFW's success to a favorable political opportunity structure, but does not explain why the UFW succeeded while its rivals failed, especially when they had access to far greater resources. The fact the UFW strategy worked does not explain why it alone devised such a strategy. And citing the “charismatic leadership” of Cesar Chavez does not explain how this leadership worked. To explain this outcome—the UFW's success and the failure of its rivals—I compared organizational strategy. To explain differences in strategy I compared leadership teams that devised it, the structure of their organizations, and their pattern of interaction with the environment. Biographical data on leaders reveals systematic differences in their life experience, sociocultural networks, and repertoires of collective action. Organizational analysis reveals systematic differences in deliberative processes, accountability mechanisms, and resource flows. Building on creativity theory, I argue that the likelihood a leadership team will devise effective strategy—its strategic capacity—depends on its motivation, access to salient knowledge, and heuristic processes. The strategic capacity of a leadership team will be greater if it includes insiders and outsiders to salient constituencies, those with strong and weak ties to these constituencies, and those who have learned diverse repertoires of collective action. Leaders will make the most of these attributes if they conduct regular, open, and authoritative deliberations, are accountable to multiple, salient constituencies, and draw their resources from them. In sum, I explain the UFW's success over its rivals by differences in strategy, account for differences in strategy by how it was developed, and explain how it was developed in the interactions of leaders, organizations, and environment. Understanding strategic capacity can help explain how resourcefulness can compensate for lack of resources—or why David can sometimes win.",304590601,,Dissertations & Theses," Ganz, Marshall LouisGanzLouisMarshallGanz, Marshall Louis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727793421 , 19227731 , 66569 , 9780599958494 , 0599958499 , 9988550 , 9988550", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599958494 , 0599958499", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304590601?accountid=14496," 0451 Social psychology , 0629 Labor relations"," 0451 Social psychology , 0629 Labor relations"," 0451 Social psychology , 0629 Labor relations",," 0451 Social psychology , 0629 Labor relations"," Social psychology , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Psychology , Agriculture , California , Farm workers , Mexican-Americans , Social movements , Unionization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Five+smooth+stones%3A++Strategic+capacity+in+the+unionization+of+California+agriculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ganz%2C+Marshall+Louis&amp;isbn=9780599958494&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3628,"Towards a theater of the common people: New interactions between classical, folk and modern theater in Koothu -p -Pattarai, Rang Vidushak and Ankanam","K-p-p, Rang Vidushak and Ankanam are key players in a project called the Theatre Laboratory Scheme (TLS), initially supported by the Ford Foundation and later by the Indian Foundation for the Arts (IFA), formed of ten regionally diverse theater companies breaking fresh ground in Indian experimental theater, especially through intra-Indian networking. Fifty-three years after gaining her independence from the British, India faces an alarming array of power struggles between different identities and interests—political, ethnic, religious and economic. A complex interplay of factors have contributed to India's contemporary identity crisis—her history, pluralism, paradoxical straining subcultures and movements, modernity, the opening of India as a global market and rising consumerism. Modern Indian theater's artistic crisis, which mirrors her post-colonial crisis as a nation, has undergone many changes in its endeavor to forge a genuinely contemporary Indian theater that reflects India's complex identities, cultures and myriad artistic expressions. Artists in free India rejected the colonial model of theater they had blindly imitated and rediscovered their own rich indigenous artistic traditions. Modern theater practitioners experimented with classical, folk and modern theater forms—these experiments have developed into an array of trends from the “theater of roots” to the theater of the common people , envisioned by K-p-p, Rang Vidushak and Ankanam. A significant contribution of K-p-p, Rang Vidushak and Ankanam is that they have nourished in-depth interactions between traditional and modern theater forms and arts by grasping the principles, lifestyles and cultural context behind each form rather than thoughtless imitation and incorporation of exotic images and techniques. Furthermore, they have successfully harnessed traditional expression with contemporary concerns, facilitated mutually beneficial exchanges between traditional and modern performers, developed region-specific actor training methodologies, created original scripts and styles of performance and elevated the role of the artistic process over the product. Apart from artistic contributions, the TLS and its representative companies have tremendous social and political significance, from modeling an artistic community that synthesizes India's pluralistic identity to addressing critical current issues. At the heart of the problems that plague contemporary India lies the plight of the common people, and in the theater of the TLS companies these problems are examined from the perspective of the common man. In spite of major artistic and social contributions, there remain a few contradictions in the theater of K-p-p, Rang Vidushak and Ankanam, particularly the subordinate status of the actor and the lack of actresses in these, and other TLS companies, and weaknesses in developing actor training methodologies. The central challenge for an inclusive contemporary Indian theater would be to synthesize the maddening diversity of Indian culture with its modern and traditional components; to address the second class position of the actor and the lack of actresses; to question any vestiges of orientalisin that may seep into the directors' attempts to create a genuinely contemporary theater and to transform the hierarchy, management and income-generation of the TLS companies. However, despite contradictions and future challenges, the artistic process of these and other TLS companies has brought the vision of a contemporary Indian theater of the common people closer to its fall realization.",304592077,,Dissertations & Theses," Singh, VidhuSinghVidhuSingh, Vidhu", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728370281 , 19559031 , 66569 , 9780599972292 , 0599972297 , 9990279 , 9990279", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599972292 , 0599972297", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304592077?accountid=14496," 0465 Theater , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0465 Theater , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0465 Theater , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0465 Theater , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Theater , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Ankanam , India , Koothu-p-Pattarai , Rang Vidushak , Theater",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Towards+a+theater+of+the+common+people%3A++New+interactions+between+classical%2C+folk+and+modern+theater+in+Koothu+-p+-Pattarai%2C+Rang+Vidushak+and+Ankanam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Singh%2C+Vidhu&amp;isbn=9780599972292&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3629,“And the stones shall cry out”¹: Native American identity and self -determination in the United Methodist Church,"The missionizing of Indians in North America was largely an attempt to assimilate Indians during the first two hundred years in America. Christian evangelism among the Indians was a two-pronged process. To Christianize the Indians meant to Europeanize them as well. For the Indians, social and cultural accommodation meant accepting political, religious and cultural change. Pedagogical applications to teaching and proselytizing the Indians were insensitive and demoralizing. Yet in the nineteenth century, Indians who accepted Methodism re-defined the evangelical mission of the Methodist Church. This study will examine how Native American society and culture reacted to the Methodist institution that they encountered. Indians within the Methodist Church made choices that helped maintain their tribal heritage and culture and incorporated them into Christian worship. At times this created a paradox for Indian Methodists. As they became empowered they also became more acculturated. Yet elements of acculturation were temporary as the long term goal for many Indian Methodists was the regeneration of traditional beliefs into Christian worship and Indian life. It has been a reciprocal process where the sanctity of Native American elements of worship have become a way of life for Native American Christians whose values and ancient beliefs were seldom compromised in their understanding of Christianity. The paper will look closely at Native Americans and spirituality where a one-way process occurred that viewed Indians as victims and missions as failures. Using oral testimonies and written documents, this paper will explore how Indians addressed these issues from the early years of missionizing by the Methodists and demonstrate that a significant shift in the mission relationship between Indians and Methodists occurred as early as the mid-nineteenth century. While Methodist missionaries continued to attempt forced assimilation upon Indian converts, many Native Americans resisted and incorporated indigenous practices and lifestyles which accelerated in the late 1960s through the present. Historians have argued that Native Americans have been assimilated in their encounters with non-Indian peoples. Assimilation can be described as communities experiencing an overall decline of their societies leading to the abandonment of their culture. Although Indian communities did experience periods of decline, I will argue that assimilation did not take place as Native American communities within the church developed over the period discussed in the paper. The Indian community as well as the Methodist Church made accommodations, which were reciprocal in nature with each side benefiting from the relationship. This study will rely greatly on oral history. Oral history is central to the Native American experience and one can not grasp the full meaning of the Native American story if oral history is down played or excluded altogether. Oral history preserves the integrity of the Native American point of view. The history of acculturated Indians and Indians in the twentieth century has not received the attention that it deserves which is why much of this study will look at Indians who had adopted Methodism as a religious practice. The general context of the paper will show how Indians constructed opportunities within the context of Methodism, which allowed them to form barriers against total assimilation, and create opportunities in their changing world. Interviews with members of the Oklahoma Indian Missionary Conference will serve to document the historical movements within the Methodist and United Methodist Church. 1 Luke 19:40, Habakkuk 2:11, The Holy Bible New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Bible Publishers, 1978).",304603202,,Dissertations & Theses," Ortiz, Leonard DavidOrtizDavidLeonardOrtiz, Leonard David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727867811 , 32080561 , 66569 , 0493063110 , 9780493063119 , 9998104 , 9998104", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 0493063110 , 9780493063119", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304603202?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations",," 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations"," American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Religion , Religious congregations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Identity , Native American , Self-determination , United Methodist",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CAnd+the+stones+shall+cry+out%E2%80%9D%C2%B9%3A+%0ANative+American+identity+and+self+-determination+in+the+United+Methodist+Church&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ortiz%2C+Leonard+David&amp;isbn=0493063110&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3630,Technologies of Islamic piety: Cassette-sermons and the ethics of listening,"This dissertation addresses a range of questions about language and the body through an ethnographic study of cassette-sermons in Egypt. Three dimensions of cassette-sermon practice were central to my project. First, I examined cassette-sermon listening as an ethical exercise aimed at cultivating a modern form of Islamic piety, one rooted in a long tradition of moral self-cultivation. My analysis focuses on contemporary sermon rhetorics and the demands of proper audition which these place on listeners, among them, a familiarity with a variety of classical and modern knowledges, certain forms of concentration and responsiveness, as well as competence in a particular affective-gestural repertoire—the embodied dispositions which undergird well-informed reasoning within contemporary traditions of Islam. Secondly, I locate the new practices of cassette-sermon audition in relation to the historical trajectory of the broader Islamic movement in Egypt since the 19 th century. As a technology of individual piety, these tapes join the individual's task of cultivating Islamic virtues with broader social concerns of the Islamic awakening, including issues of societal transformation, state legal reform, and national and international politics. Thus, my dissertation explores how tapes provide a medium for public discussion of a wide variety of issues relevant to contemporary Egyptian society, a discussion, however, conducted on the basis of the ethical capacities, orientations, and goals toward which the act of sermon audition is geared. Lastly, I argue that the cassette-sermon provides an opportunity to explore the impact of mass media and modern print-oriented literacies on the forms of contemporary piety, and the conditions of religious practice within Egypt more generally. Of particular concern to me here is the question of how the virtues listeners sought to cultivate were mediated, on the one hand, by functional possibilities of cassette technology, such as mobility, replay, and discontinuous listening; and on the other, by the discursive conventions of the modern print and televisual-based public sphere. To this end, my work explores the complicated interplay between the cassette medium and the institutional, cultural, and religious contexts within which it is employed.",304603516,,Dissertations & Theses," Hirschkind, Charles KendalHirschkindKendalCharlesHirschkind, Charles Kendal", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730324781 , 19229131 , 66569 , 9780599527454 , 0599527455 , 9950536 , 9950536", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599527454 , 0599527455", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304603516?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Cultural anthropology , Religion , Rhetoric , Composition"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Cassette-sermons , Ethics , Islamic , Listening , Piety , Sermons",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Technologies+of+Islamic+piety%3A++Cassette-sermons+and+the+ethics+of+listening&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hirschkind%2C+Charles+Kendal&amp;isbn=9780599527454&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3631,A hegemonic analysis of John Howard Lawson and the New Playwrights Theatre,"The concept of hegemony was first developed by Antonio Gramsci and recorded in his Prison Notebooks while imprisoned under Mussolini's fascist Italian government from 1926 until his death in 1937. Gramsci's ideas concerning hegemony involve positioning the relationship between political society (what Gramsci calls the “State”) and civil, or “private,” society as a hegemonic relationship in which predominance depends upon the ratio between control and the willingness to be controlled. Using hegemony as an analytical strategy, the early theatrical career of John Howard Lawson as a playwright and founding member of the New Playwrights Theatre can be viewed through multiple hegemonic relationships, both personal and professional. In addition to identifying the actual, real-life hegemonic relationships between Lawson and his peers, the fictitious hegemonic relationships developed in the plots of his early plays Roger Bloomer, Processional and Nirvana , as well as the plays of Lawson and his colleagues produced by the New Playwrights Theatre from 1927 through 1929, will be examined. Chapter I of this dissertation places Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony into three categories: (1) Hegemony explains social order. It is not just a revolutionary strategy. (2) In Capitalist societies, hegemony encapsulates a “war of position,” not a “war of movement.” (3) Hegemony describes a sequence of subaltern coalitions that can either support or be directed against official (State) socio-cultural hegemony. In Chapter II, hegemonic relationships affecting Lawson's education, military service and experiences in Europe and his early years as a playwright will be examined. In Chapter III, his association with the New Playwrights Theatre will be viewed within similar parameters of hegemonic analysis. The plays of Lawson and the New Playwrights Theatre will then be examined under three hegemonic/counterhegemonic groupings: (1) Religious and Racial Tolerance/Prejudice: Lawson's Nirvana , Em Jo Basshe's Earth and The Centuries , and Michael Gold's Hoboken Blues . (2) Industrialized Management Control/Organized Labor Rebellion: Lawson's Processional , Paul Sifton's The Belt , Upton Sinclair's Singing Jailbirds and John Dos Passos' Airways, Inc.

Taiwan, like many other countries, has designed educational reform initiatives to support increased educational quality. In 1994, Taiwan developed an approach to deregulate its educational system. Specific reforms in elementary education included setting up a Teachers' Assessment and Evaluation Council (TAEC) in every school, reducing the size of classes and schools, changing the system for the approval of textbooks, and increasing teacher autonomy. Attention was also given to reforming the traditional examination processes. However, educational policies emerge from ideologies of the people who design and promulgate them. The political movements, economic conditions, and social values of the day shape these ideologies. Since 1994, policy implementation has been underway. The purposes of this study were to: (1) describe the national educational policies in Taiwan; and (2) examine the emerging educational programs, issues, and concerns connected to policy implementation. Taiwan's experiences with educational reform were compared to those of Japan, the United Kingdom, and France to help generate a sense of the meaning and relevance of Taiwan's initiatives. Qualitative research strategies, including interviews and document analyses, were used to generate and analyze data. Participants included policy makers, researchers, and educators who had knowledge of the national agendas, familiarity with local and regional issues, and experience with school-based implementation of the educational improvement policies. Based on the data generated through this study, the educational reform agenda was clarified. Taiwan's education policy initiatives include a complex and comprehensive array of activities to reform governance, funding, curriculum, and the examination system. Important issues in policy implementation that are emerging include: (1) the variety of professional dilemmas that accompany school-based control; (2) the demands of instructional and curricular improvement; (3) the need of identify more efficient and equitable funding policies; and (4) the identification of strategies to deal with problems that arise in implementation. Comparison with the experiences of policy makers and educators in Japan, the United Kingdom, and France revealed that, although there are similarities in approaches, strategies for enacting deregulation and increasing local control differ, especially as they related to cultural traditions.",304607928,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Shih-MinLiuShih-MinLiu, Shih-Min", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728325391 , 19554671 , 66569 , 9780599878754 , 0599878754 , 9981429 , 9981429", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599878754 , 0599878754", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304607928?accountid=14496, 0514 School administration, 0514 School administration, 0514 School administration,, 0514 School administration, School administration," Education , China , Policy , Reform , School improvement , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+new+directions+in+Taiwan%27s+education++*policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Shih-Min&amp;isbn=9780599878754&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3633,Out of the jungle: Jimmy Hoffa and the remaking of the American working class,"By examining the career of International Brotherhood of Teamsters leader James R. Hoffa within the changing context of twentieth-century American industrial relations, this dissertation challenges many of the tenets of the so-called “new labor history,” which has largely ignored the Teamsters and other affiliates of the American Federation of Labor in favor of the much smaller Congress of Industrial Organizations. This study reveals Hoffa's mid-century Detroit as a violent underworld in which trucking firms and other small businesses were terrorized into submission to the Teamsters, police and politicians were bought with near impunity, saloons were the locus of social activity, criminals disemployed by the repeal of prohibition provided a wealth of useful services, and unions battled against each other with as much frequency and fury as they did against employers. Yet while relying on the techniques of the new labor history to unearth this culture, this study contradicts the scholarship of the past generation in many important ways. While historians since the 1960s have looked within the labor movement for a purpose other than “delivering the goods,” Hoffa's Teamsters adhered to a strictly economic mission and scorned the attempts by radicals and “labor statesmen” to bring workers into the managerial classes. Similarly, this study presents new labor historians with the troubling fact that much of the rapid growth and prodigious material accomplishments of the Teamsters was caused not by the “industrial democracy” they endorse but by competition both within the IBT and from rival unions. Beginning with the rise of the wartime state in 1941, Hoffa's world of unloosed conflict was continually confronted by government officials and labor leaders seeking to civilize the class struggle. The CIO's campaign to unify labor and share power in a managed economic system merged with efforts by government agencies to normalize industrial relations and to remake militant workers into responsible citizens. However, this study shows that while these intrusions into Hoffa's jungle often benefited Hoffa personally, they produced dubious results for the working class itself.",304621965,,Dissertations & Theses," Russell, Thaddeus NathanRussellNathanThaddeusRussell, Thaddeus Nathan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 731968881 , 19239001 , 66569 , 0599752327 , 9780599752320 , 9970266 , 9970266", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 0599752327 , 9780599752320", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304621965?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations",," 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," American history , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Hoffa, James R. , International Brotherhood of Teamsters , Working class",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Out+of+the+jungle%3A++Jimmy+Hoffa+and+the+remaking+of+the+American+working+class&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Russell%2C+Thaddeus+Nathan&amp;isbn=0599752327&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3634,The Women's Ordination Conference (1975–1994): An introduction to a movement,"The Women's Ordination Conference (WOC) offers perhaps the most significant example of American Catholic popular theological discussion of the ordination of women in the Catholic Church. This dissertation studies the women's ordination issue in the U.S. from 1975, the year of the First International Women's Ordination Conference, to 1994, the issuance of Ordinatio Sacerdotalis . In particular, the dissertation investigates how WOC and the hierarchy treat three key themes inherent in the debate: Theological anthropology (the nature of humanity as male and female); the roles and status of men and women in church and society; and the general understanding and flourishing of church order and social order. The contribution of the dissertation is two-fold. First, it provides an introduction to central theological dimensions of the debate. After the introduction (Chapter 1), I examine the historical context of the hierarchical Catholic teachings on the ordination of women between 1975 and 1994. I demonstrate and evaluate some arguments in these documents giving specific attention to the following themes: (a) theological anthropology, (b) roles and status of men and women in church and society, (c) understanding of church order and social order (Chapter 2). Second, my cataloging and studying of Marquette University Memorial Library's WOC Archives, which had not been previously investigated, makes these materials more readily and widely accessible for other researchers. After providing a brief historical overview of the WOC conferences, its dialogue with U.S. Bishops, its national leaders, its prominent theological voices, its actions and its key themes (Chapter 3), I analyze the arguments used by WOC in light of the three aforementioned focal themes (Chapter 4). In the concluding chapter, I confirm that a positive interchange between the hierarchy and WOC regarding these three themes is instrumental to explicate this issue in contemporary American Catholicism.

Agricultural pollution from animal feeding operations (AFOs) is becoming a major environmental consideration in the high hog production regions of the United States as well as in the heavy production areas of Northern Europe. As environmental concerns increase and governmental regulations are imposed to protect the environmental quality in these areas, will there be changes in production signaling an increase in competitiveness for regions with more lax environmental regulatory standards? This is an important question for the U.S. hog and pork industries from both a domestic (interstate) and an international perspective. The first half of this study examines differences in U.S. state water quality regulations and their influence on the location of hog production in the United States. Modeling the profit maximization decision of hog producers allows investigation as to whether or not the current changes in the industry towards larger and more geographically concentrated operations has been influenced by differences in environmental regulation. This analysis is conducted separately on small and large operations in order to allow examination of the differences in the regulatory effect by size of operation. The results of this analysis provide evidence that environmental compliance costs are significant for small hog feeding operations, while hog production on large operations does not seem to be influenced by the level of environmental stringency. Implications for policy making include the fact that the observed movement of large hog operations out of traditional mid-western states is not primarily a consequence of differences in environmental regulation and therefore, current policy proposals calling for harmonized national AFO manure management standards may not be necessary. Also, policy makers concerned with the economic and social implications of decreasing small farm production will want to consider the detrimental effects of increasing environmental regulation on these small producers. The second half of the study examines the effects of increasing U.S. and European Union (EU) environmental regulation on the competitiveness of the U.S. pork exporting industry. An equilibrium displacement model is developed to estimate the magnitude of the effect on U.S. pork export quantities and also to calculate producer welfare changes. A review of information on the environmental regulation imposed on the major pork exporters is provided as background to the current policy environment in each of these countries. Results show that the expected increase in U.S. hog producers' compliance costs lead to only minor losses in competitiveness for the U.S. pork industry and in fact it is the hog producers, not the pork processors, who bear the majority of the economic loss. Changes in EU environmental regulation over the next few years are expected to be more restrictive than those imposed in the United States. Examining these changes in EU regulation shows that over a range of EU regulatory scenarios, U.S. pork becomes more competitive as EU pork prices increase significantly in the face of very stringent environmental regulation. Future trade policy implications of these results include the need of EU countries to negotiate harmonized environmental standards to equate environmental compliance costs across pork producing countries.",304631249,,Dissertations & Theses," Metcalfe, Mark RobertMetcalfeRobertMarkMetcalfe, Mark Robert", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726067041 , 19527511 , 66569 , 9780493466613 , 0493466614 , 3033690 , 3033690", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780493466613 , 0493466614", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304631249?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0617 Public administration"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0617 Public administration"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0617 Public administration",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0617 Public administration"," Agricultural economics , Public administration , Impact analysis , Studies , Environmental regulations , Hogs"," Social sciences , Environmental regulation , Hog industry , Pork industry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Environmental+regulation+and+implications+for+the+United+States+hog+and+pork+industries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Metcalfe%2C+Mark+Robert&amp;isbn=9780493466613&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3636,Monstrous desires: Psychopathy and subjectivity in Cold War America,"My dissertation situates a preoccupation for Cold War culture, the figure of the sexual psychopath, within a conceptual history of the monstrous. The monstrous is a cultural space in which definitions of the natural, the normative, and the human are formulated and reinforced by means of aberrations and anomalies. Considered in this light, I argue, the literary, legal, and scientific representations of the psychopath produced in the U.S. during the Cold War constituted the simultaneous emergence and attempted containment of a new form of monstrosity. Legal and scientific accounts of the psychopath tried to theorize and disarm him, even as popular journalism and citizens' crusades emphasized the threat he posed. By examining psychopathy as an instance of monstrosity, my dissertation undertakes an historical and theoretical double-movement in order to revise our understanding of postwar culture. Placing the psychopath within a conceptual genealogy of monstrosity reveals the ways in which this, by definition , marginal figure created a repository both for the exclusions against which so-called normal sexual subjectivity was defined and for the social and political anxieties that informed American culture as the nation emerged as a global superpower. At the same time, the psychopath's particular, historical features—his departures from traditional models of monstrosity—disclose hitherto unrecognized conceptual transformations in our understanding of the monstrous and, consequently, of the human. Literary texts are a privileged, if provisional and by no means exclusive, locus of investigation in the dissertation. If the psychopath was, according to legal and scientific accounts, a reified disruption of natural processes, from the perspective of conceptual and literary history he was a set of stories, narratives generated in various scientific quarters about a new figure on the landscape. And so the fictional accounts of the psychopath translated—with all of the creative and critical modulation that the term implies—these stories from a variety of technical discourses aimed at specialized readerships into narratives for general consumption. In these narratives the parameters of licit desire and ordinary subjectivity were most visibly naturalized, negotiated or contested for the public imagination.",304642061,,Dissertations & Theses," Whiting, FrederickWhitingFrederickWhiting, Frederick", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 731877571 , 19568671 , 66569 , 0599696869 , 9780599696860 , 9965173 , 9965173", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 0599696869 , 9780599696860", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304642061?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies",," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies"," American literature , American studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Cold War , Masculinity , Monstrosity , Psychopathy , Sexuality , Subjectivity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Monstrous+desires%3A++Psychopathy+and+subjectivity+in+Cold+War+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Whiting%2C+Frederick&amp;isbn=0599696869&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3637,Human rights and the state: Changing roles in a liberal economy,"The role of the federal state in Canada has always been one of change and adaptation.

Canada, in a neo-liberal economy, is trying to achieve a balance of power which provides appropriate representation of and protection for its citizens. This paper follows both the state's efforts to regain power at regional, national and international levels and the expectations Canadians have of the federal government. The two concepts meet in a discussion of the potential benefits of a joint partnership between the federal government and the Third Sector.

Other Western scholars caution against the aims of the growing Islamic movement for change against neo-colonial institutions and the Western political domination of the Muslim world. The author attempts to examine the phenomenon of change and reformation in the post-colonial Muslim world that continues to live under the “no system” of anarchy and repression. Islam seems to emphasize change as an important precept of human life, but Muslim scholars have ignored its significance in social, economic and political policy. The West has achieved material change, but seems to have sacrificed the spiritual dimension of the human reality, says John Saul (“The Unconscious Civilization”), and this has caused a conflict between man and society, rather than peace and harmony. Muslims and the West both seem to aspire for change in different ways and for different reasons. The author introduces the readers to new insights into the much-neglected role and importance of the originality of Islamic “thinking” as the foundation for human change and relations; and explains that Islamic principles and values may be viewed as contributing factors to human solidarity from Adam to Mohammed, as its message is valid for the whole of mankind. Generally speaking. Islam attempts to foster a natural harmony and understanding among man, society, the state and humanity as a whole, all being part of the organic unity of things in the world. Yet, this factor has been all too absent from the secular intellectual perceptions and the foreign policymaking agendas of the West. The Western industrialized nations put forth varied notions of “civilization”, “self-conflicting freedoms” and overwhelmingly materialistic systems devoid of spirituality. The author notes that the West cannot be blamed for its political indifference and misinformation with regard to Islam, because the Muslim world seems to have lost the capacity to demonstrate a living model of Islam and its past contributions to the unity of mankind. However, the movement for change and societal reformation is deeply rooted in the Muslim world, and the author proposes an innovative framework for reformation, from strategic planning to the revitalization of political institutions, as the essential foundation for peace and security conceived of as a global phenomenon and part of the objective of One World.

Overlooked by many observers is the potential of national to serve as a foundation for collective action which may then be used for progressive political purposes. This thesis examines the potential of the civic-nationalist discourse of the Scottish National party to serve as a non-ethnic, non-exclusionary social movement for the enhancement of Scottish democracy and sovereignty. Issues of sovereignty, identity and sovereignty are examined through an analysis of the official discourse of the party. The three areas examined are critical features of a nationalist party's discourse. A thorough examination of each yields the evidence on which to draw conclusions about the limits and potential of civic nationalism for providing the foundation for local resistance to neo-liberal globalization. The discussion of sovereignty considers the impact of economic globalization and Scotland's membership in the European Union. The volatility of the global oil market and the mobility of financial capital constitute threats to the objectives of the Scottish National Party's social policy agenda. The European Union also threatens to intrude upon Scottish sovereignty by reducing the scope for independent policy-making by a Scottish government. Identity is examined in order to determine the commitment of the Scottish National party to a non-ethnic, non-exclusive conception of political community. The party has made a determined effort to transcend societal cleavages of gender, race, religion and sexual identity within the limitations of the party's broad commitment to liberal values of equality. Finally, the extent to which the Scottish National Party's civic nationalism can create the conditions for a robust and renewed Scottish democracy is analyzed. The party's commitment to a written constitution, as well as electoral reform contains the promise of remedying the democratic deficit with which Scotland has had to deal with in the United Kingdom.",304649200,,Dissertations & Theses," Hamilton, Paul HunterHamiltonHunterPaulHamilton, Paul Hunter", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728863191 , 19255661 , 66569 , 9780612595958 , 0612595951 , NQ59595 , NQ59595", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780612595958 , 0612595951", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304649200?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Civic nationalism , Discourse , Scottish National Party , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+limits+and+potential+of+civic+nationalism%3A++The+case+of+the+Scottish+National+Party&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hamilton%2C+Paul+Hunter&amp;isbn=9780612595958&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3640,"Suomen valkoinen sotilasarkkitehtuuri, 1926–1939","This thesis examines the architects and architecture of the Finnish Defence Forces in the inter-war era. It analyses architecture within the frame of power discourse, i.e. as political architecture. My main point is that the Defence Forces used architecture together with cinema, press photos and literature as a medium of propaganda for the national defence effort. I focus my argument on barracks, military hospitals, airports and the Helsinki Military Academy and interpret architecture from the angle of contemporary social and military aspirations. The thesis also provides an overview of public architecture elsewhere in Europe, including the German, Swedish and Soviet military architecture of the same period. The Finnish Defence Forces were formed in the inter-war period. The air force was then a totally new branch of the armed services. The medical services of the Defence Forces were modernised and large, modern military hospitals were built in Viipuri and Helsinki. The main aim in planning new barracks was to create healthy and hygienic living conditions for all conscripts. For strategic reasons, most of the new garrisons were situated near the eastern border in South Karelia and on Lake Ladoga. All military buildings were planned at the Construction Bureau in the Technical Department of the Ministry of Defence between 1926 and 1939. The Construction Bureau was then one of the largest architectural studios in the country. It is notable, that a number of women architects worked and established their careers there. The international Modern Movement and its planning methods, which emphasised economy and hygiene were adopted by the Finnish Defence Forces in the 1930s. The National Defence used 1930s architecture to propagate the modernity and progressiveness of the young republic. “White military architecture” thus embodied the spirit of the Defence Forces, which was rooted in the values of the White Guard of the Finnish Civil War. This white functionalistic architecture contrasted sharply with the old red-brick barracks, which stood as a testimony of the time when Finland was a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire.",304657245,,Dissertations & Theses," Makinen, Anne ElisabetMakinenElisabetAnneMakinen, Anne Elisabet", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725122331 , 31611751 , 66569 , 9789517461719 , 9517461712 , C807060 , C807060", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9789517461719 , 9517461712", Finnish, Finnish,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304657245?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0335 European history , 0377 Art History"," 0729 Architecture , 0335 European history , 0377 Art History"," 0729 Architecture , 0335 European history , 0377 Art History",," 0729 Architecture , 0335 European history , 0377 Art History"," Architecture , European history , Art History"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Finland , Military architecture , Modernism , Propaganda",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Suomen+valkoinen+sotilasarkkitehtuuri%2C+1926%E2%80%931939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Makinen%2C+Anne+Elisabet&amp;isbn=9789517461719&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3641,Negotiating South Africa's economic future: COSATU and strategic unionism,"This dissertation investigated South Africa's ‘second transition,’ the economic policy negotiations that accompanied the commencement of majority rule. It focused on the efforts of the largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), to shape the economic framework of post-apartheid South Africa. To do this, it analyzed how the federation made use of three national economic and labour policy negotiating forums, the National Economic Forum, the National Manpower Commission and their successor, the National Economic Development and Labour Council. These forums were comprised of representatives of business, labour and government. The dissertation drew upon a number of policy engagements between 1992 and 1997 to assess organized labour's interventions as measured against the goals for economic transformation that the trade union federation had approved. It found that COSATU did not substantially shape core labour and economic policies through its participation in the national policy-making structures. In the realm of macroeconomic policy, COSATU was starkly at odds with the government's approach and pushed for a fundamental revision of the program. In the area of industrial restructuring and trade liberalization, COSATU was marginal to the policy-making process. Only in the sphere of labour rights and standards could the trade union movement point to clear gains and even in this instance they were disappointed by some of the provisions contained in the new legislative framework. The dissertation identified several factors that contributed to COSATU's inability to play a more substantial role in shaping the post-apartheid economic dispensation. Two factors that shaped the context for the South African economic transition worked against the federation's agenda: the importance of South Africa's economic structure (dominated by a small number of very large mining conglomerates) and the nature of the international economic regulatory regime of the 1990s. Actors associated with these two important and interrelated social forces influenced African National Congress economic policies both before and after the first democratic elections while neutralizing many of COSATU's proposals. The dissertation suggested, however, that notable weaknesses in the trade union federation's own interventions further limited its influence.

Contemporary environmentalism and Aboriginal land rights have both challenged the status of pastoralists as valued primary producers and bearers of a worthy pioneer heritage. Instead, pastoralists have become associated with land degradation, biodiversity loss, and Aboriginal dispossession. Such pressure has intensified in the 1990s in the wake of the Native Title debate, and various conservation campaigns in the arid and semi-arid rangelands. The pressures on pastoralists occur in the context of wider reassessments of the social and economic values of rangelands in which pastoralism is seen as having declined in value compared to ‘post-production’ land uses. Reassessments of rangelands in turn are part of global changes in the status of rural areas, and of the growing flexibility in the very meaning of ‘rural’. Through ethnographic fieldwork among largely non-indigenous pastoralists in Central Australia, this thesis investigates the nature and foundations of pastoralists' responses to these changes and critiques. Through memory, history, labour and experience of land, non-indigenous pastoralists construct a narrative of land, themselves and others in which the presence of pastoralism in Central Australia is naturalised, and Central Australia is narrated as an inherently pastoral landscape. Particular types of environmental knowledge and experience, based in actual environmental events and processes form the foundation for a discourse of pastoral property rights. Pastoralists accommodate environmental concerns, through advocating environmental stewardship. They do this in such a way that Central Australia is maintained as a singularly pastoral landscape, and one in which a European, or ‘white’, frame of reference continues to dominate. In this way the domesticated pastoral landscapes of colonialism and nationalism are reproduced. The thesis also examines Aboriginal pastoralism as a distinctive form of pastoralism, which fulfills distinctly Aboriginal land use and cultural aspirations, and undermines the conventional meaning of ‘pastoralism’ itself.

The thesis is that militarism proved critical in the rise of East Asia and Western Europe, while locking the US into a path dependent process of militarization. Militarism was instrumental in the rise and demise of the New Deal world order, the loss of the peace dividend and globalization. The empirical base of the work is an analysis of high finance, military industrialization and race-ethnic-class formation in the development of the National Security State Corporate Complex (NSSCC)—denoting the fusion of private corporate power and public state bureaucracy—and rise and demise of the New Deal world order. The origins of this NSSCC are traced to the formation of an embryonic military-industrial complex and Anglo-American Establishment during the corporate restructuring, militarized financial expansion, overseas imperialism, and war preparedness movements around the turn of the century. This war collectivism, became the model for US hegemony on the enlarged social foundations of the US warfare-welfare state. The thesis adjudicates the debate between state autonomy, class dominance and world-system theorists as to the primary logic of the modern world. While the contradictions between the pursuit of power and profit are examined, this investigation analyzes the centrality of profit and synthesis of violence, profits and power in entwined processes of politico-military competition, capital accumulation and waves of state-corporate globalization. Due to the internalization of allied protection costs, militarism played a much larger role in US capitalist enterprises and state management of global hegemony than during Britain's hundred years' peace in Europe. Changes in the global/regional geopolitical economy of military spending over the centuries are explored in terms of multiple functions of deflecting class struggle towards overseas expansion while supporting capital accumulation and military power projection capability to defend global state-corporate interests. This account of the changing geopolitical economy of militarism is used to analyze the fiscal crisis of the warfare-welfare state, the right turn of the Anglo-American Establishment, the rise of the New Right and the demise of the New Deal world order.",304663778,,Dissertations & Theses," Reifer, Thomas EhrlichReiferEhrlichThomasReifer, Thomas Ehrlich", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732086191 , 19232741 , 66569 , 9780599810099 , 0599810092 , 9975567 , 9975567", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000," 9780599810099 , 0599810092", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304663778?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0501 Economics , 0510 Labor economics"," 0700 Social structure , 0501 Economics , 0510 Labor economics"," 0700 Social structure , 0501 Economics , 0510 Labor economics",," 0700 Social structure , 0501 Economics , 0510 Labor economics"," Social structure , Economics , Labor economics , Militarism , International relations , Studies , Globalization , Welfare"," Social sciences , Globalization , Military-industrial complex , New Deal , Power , Profits , Warfare-welfare state , Welfare state , World order",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Violence%2C+profits+and+power%3A++Globalization%2C+the+warfare-welfare+state+and+the+rise+and+demise+of+the+New+Deal+world+order&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reifer%2C+Thomas+Ehrlich&amp;isbn=9780599810099&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3644,Educación de la afectividad. Una propuesta educativa desde el pensamiento de Tomás de Aquino,"The education of effectively in the last instance brings up the problem of the emotional mastery of the human being. Lately, several authors have approached this issue, focusing its importance on education due to the clearness of evidence that good human relationships presuppose the appropriate government of own subjectivity. Although the main pedagogical propositions that emerge from such educational theories conclude in a theoretical mastery of the subject and in more or less critical situations, besides proposing an insane dependency on a “specialist”, these pedagogical propositions do not wholly solve the practical sense of the self-government. Ever since the classical philosophy, Thomas Aquinas teaches that emotions or feelings are interior forces that demand a mild mastery through two cardinal virtues formed in the interior of the subject; these virtues, far from submerging the effectively or controlling it despotically, direct and guide it conveniently in benefit of a good and effective action, collaborating in a meaningful way to the attainment of happiness. In this way, temperance is the virtue that regulates the leading movements that are directed towards the absolute sensitive goodness, among which pleasure, the basic emotion for bodily constitution, outstands. On the other hand, fortitude permits resistance and affirmation of human goodness, against various sensitive and affective obstacles that appear in the individual's actions, such as fear, a mediate emotion that retracts the activity. If in general the effectively directs itself throughout these virtues, in the global approach of the interior growth of mankind—in which education is comprised—both temperance and fortitude constitute the main basis for personal and social growth. The reason for this, is that effectively is the link between the bodily and spiritual growth; its correct disposition depends on the proper use of these human abilities, intelligence and will. For this reason, during childhood, parents try to form a series of habits, in the realm of temperance, in the child's ordinary activities that guide his subjective interior since he has a natural tendency to dispersion. In adolescence, it is a prior issue to form the other habits, in the realm of fortitude, to avoid the own emotional disorder of this evolutive stage, which detracts from the good performance. The development of both virtues demands the direct participation of both parents; but not through a rational lecturing teaching but by means of example and activity; this education will permit the adequate development of the most important cardinal virtues, justice and prudence, whose function is to direct in the most perfect manner for its own sake and the good of other people as well.",304679883,,Dissertations & Theses," Roqueni Rello, Jose ManuelRoqueni RelloManuelJoseRoqueni Rello, Jose Manuel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728428331 , 32233431 , 66569 , C804921 , C804921", Dissertation/Thesis, 2000,, Spanish, Spanish,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304679883?accountid=14496, 0998 Educational theory, 0998 Educational theory, 0998 Educational theory,, 0998 Educational theory, Educational theory," Education , Affectivity , Educational proposal , Emotional mastery , Saint Thomas Aquinas , Thomas Aquinas, Saint",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Educaci%C3%B3n+de+la+afectividad.++Una+propuesta+educativa%0Adesde+el+pensamiento+de+Tom%C3%A1s+de+Aquino&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roqueni+Rello%2C+Jose+Manuel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3645,The practice of Stalin models in Eastern Europe (1948--1953),"After World War II, under the leading of Communist Parties, the People's Democracies were established in Eastern Europe. The People's Democracy was in concordance with internal and international situations. It differed from Soviet Models' Socialist and would develop toward socialism. With the deterioration of relations between the U.S and Soviet, Soviet consolidated its control over East3ern Europe in order to confront with the U.S, and then Soviet exported Stalin Models. The People's Democracies were forced to stop their own roads. Under the pressure of Soviet, the communist parties absorbed the socialist parties, party system transformed from multi--parties to one-party in nature and formed centralism in Eastern Europe. While the political systems were changed, central economical systems were established through the change of ownership in town and in countryside, importation of the Soviet industrialization policy and directive plan method. In order to get rid of obstacles to transplanting Stalin Models, many communist parties' leaders were purged. This movement was with the help of Soviet leaders. It is disastrous to copy Stalin Models. Political, economical and social progress is destroyed by Stalin models.

Excessively low urbanization level of our country has become the important factor, which restricts the sustainable development of economy and society of our country. In brief 20 years, Shenzhen City has become a modern city, which developed from a fishery village. Through the research of Shenzhen, we could probe some basic rules and solve some concrete problems in the process of urbanization of Shenzhen. This is the gist of this paper. The paper concludes several contents as below:Firstly, the paper defines the concept of urbanization. The paper thinks that urbanization is a dynamic process of transforming from traditional rural economy-society-ecology complex system to modern economy-society-ecology complex system which considers the modern cities as its carrier and activity center and considers the harmonious development between human and the nature as its value. Urbanization should be not only rural urbanization, but also re-urbanization of the cities at the same time. Future cities will sustained develop only under the conditions of openness. On the basis of the concept, the standards, the characteristics, the implications, the functions and the roles of urbanization, the paper analyses the inevitability of the urbanization, its problems and its new phenomenon. Then the paper reviews the courses of urbanization of China. The slow process and consequence of lagging urbanization shows that urbanization has become a strategic task of our country.The paper then analyses the process, present situations and development trends of Shenzhen City, to establish the base of further analysis. The paper introduces the process of different stages. On the basis of analysis the index system of measuring the level of urbanization, the paper measures and evaluates the level and effectiveness of urbanization of Shenzhen. Then the paper analyses the characteristics and present problems of the process of urbanization of Shenzhen. Though analyses, the paper considers that the process of urbanization of Shenzhen City has reached the period of gradually smooth, which begins with the speeding-up. In point of quality, the implication of urbanization should be enriched. In future, urbanization of Shenzhen City will present the trend of mixture of the city and rural areas, slowing down of the speed of the enlargement of the city’s scale, the advanced science and technology of the city’s economy, fast transformation of city’s social structure and the trend of counter-urbanization. According to the actual conditions of Shenzhen, the paper proposes the urbanization strategy of Shenzhen. That develop Shenzhen into an international city, which has unique characteristics evenly and step by step on the basis of present conditions of nature and human and economy and the system innovation. The main measures are improving industry structure, coordinating the development of Shenzhen and Hongkong and the whole Zhujiang triangle areas, completely improving the qualities of population and protecting ecology environment.On the basis of above analysis, the paper analyses the motive mechanism of urbanization. The paper analyses the norms of motive mechanism of urbanization and its basic frame. The paper lays emphases on the system arrangement, marketing, the functions of human capital, etc.Urbanization of Shenzhen City has its outstanding characteristics. Bringing the market mechanism and macrocosm adjustment and control are the two big problems in the process of urbanization of Shenzhen. The system arrangement of pushing the growth of market economy efficiently is the dynamic source of the development of urbanization. Bringing the market economy creates the historical turning point of urbanization of Shenzhen. Xiaoping Deng’s inspection tour in the south raised second summit of urbanization of Shenzhen. As for Shenzhen, the factors of external demand, foreign investments and loans, new international division order of labor etc have the decisive effects on the urbanization of Shenzhen. So we could say that the pattern of urbanization of Shenzhen is a kind of urbanization pattern which is caused by external factors.In point of the concert motive mechanism of urbanization, the institution arrangement and its changes is one of the unique motive mechanism of Shenzhen City. Institution barrier hindered the development of urbanization, but after the reform and openness, special favorable policies supplies advantages for the speeding-up urbanization of Shenzhen. Human capital has the important effect to the urbanization of Shenzhen City. Shenzhen is a typical immigration city. The entries of a great deal of labors with good qualities meet the demand of speeding-up urbanization for human capital. In the past, recurring to human capital, all kinds of favorable policies, which were given by nation could be carried out and realized smoothly. Hereafter, Shenzhen should make good use of the accumulated human capital continued, and go all out to accumulate more human capital to ensure the further development of urbanization of Shenzhen. The paper analyses these problems in detail.The process of urbanization has close relationship with the promotion of industry structure. The paper analyses the changing process of industry structure of Shenzhen and considers it is very unique, which represents mainly on the less-developed heavy industry, considering the light processing industry as its principle part, and powerful-developed third industry. This kind of industry structure has active effect on urbanization of Shenzhen on one hand, on the other hand, it has some problems such as slim relation of each industry, shortcomings on high and new science and technology industry’s enterprises’ scale, technology content of its products, and motion institution. Urbanization requires the escalation of industry structure of Shenzhen City inevitably. This sets higher requirement for the macrocosm adjustment and control of the government. The paper considers that Shenzhen should armed industries with high and new technology of high additional value and pushing the escalation of industries with market pulling, speeding up the development of high and new technology industry.Agriculture is the base of urbanization. This cannot be neglected. The demand of the development of modern cities for the agriculture has not only been the economic exploration, but also the common exploration of the functions of ecology, society etc. and their organic integration. We have to establish new concept of modern agriculture, create the “city-earning foreign exchanges-environment-sightseeing” agriculture, change the “cultivated agriculture” into “territory agriculture”, adjust agricultural structure vigorously, protect lands, explore agriculture and ecological technology on food field, speed up the facilities’ structure of metropolis agriculture, develop ecological agriculture and build metropolis information industrialization system.Effective macrocosm adjustment and control are the premises of smooth urbanization. The paper concretely analyses the macrocosm adjustment and control of Shenzhen. The macrocosm adjustment and control’s contents concludes: creating the development strategy of mixing regional social development and urbanization, deepening the reform of institution of registered permanent resident, abolishing the employment policies which sticks to the institution of registered permanent residence, deepening the reform of institutions of rural lands, creating the market-regulated institution of the movement of the usufruct of land，controlling the population, increasing the investment of education, bringing the regional plan, cities and towns’ plan and the adjustment administrative divisions into the orbit of legal institutions, reforming the finance system, the institutions of the investment and raising funds and the administrative management institutions. The institution of investment and raising funds are important problems. Shenzhen city breaks traditional model of centralized management in finance, formulating pluralistic structure of the path of capitals and management institutions, bringing market mechanism into city management and motion, breaking monopoly, encouraging competition, combine systematic coordination with enterprise-style management, improving effectiveness and levels of cities’ infrastructure and public services supply，creating the mechanism of capital-accumulation of city’s construction fit to the rules of operation of socialist market economy. Now, pluralistic principle parts of investment and raising funds and varied channels and structures of raising funds have been formulated. The function of market mechanism has been enhanced in the field of investment and raising funds. The operation of enterprise-style and joint-stock of infrastructure create beneficial conditions for breaking the administrative plan and perfecting trans-regional infrastructure construction.Plan is another important problem of macrocosm adjustment and control in urbanization. The paper analyses the concept, the categories, the importance and the rules of plan of urbanization. Then the paper analyses the previous conditions, characteristics and problems of plan of urbanization of Shenzhen, then analyses the regional town system plan and the arrangement of the plan of urbanization of Shenzhen, the perfection and the management-intensifying of it. The paper considers that two big characters in the plan of Shenzhen are leading role of the government and market-openness. Followed the development of new industries group and new cities’ structure, great changes have taken place on cities’ functions and structures. Shenzhen City should perfect urbanization plan, stick out the innovation of urbanization plan, strengthening its legality, long-term, democracy, perfect static plan with dynamic revise. Especially notice the problems of resources and the environment when carrying out the city plan. In the process of urbanization of Shenzhen, the change of the structure and ways of land use often have important effect on the development of economy and society. The paper analyses these problems.Urbanization is not only a process of economic development, but also a process of social development. After analyzing the problem of urbanization of Shenzhen from the angle of economics, the paper then analyses it in point of view of sociology. The contents conclude population, social ensure system, the change of life style and the improvement of cultural civilization, etc. After analysis the theories of population immigration and the conditions of the transformation of peasants identity to townspeople, the paper then analyses the present conditions of population problems in Shenzhen, then proposes the improvement measures of plan management institution and concrete management institutions. Aiming at heavy pressure of swelling speed of population growth and low-level population qualities to the process of city’s construction and economic construction, the paper analyses the management of population, especially nonnative population. At the same time, the paper analyses the comparatively perfect social ensure system. The paper proposes that Shenzhen should perfect social ensure system, especially bringing flowing population into the social ensure system of Shenzhen City. To a certain degree, population urbanization is the transformation of “peasant” identity to townspeople, the transformation of employment direction to non-agriculture, and the modernization of production and life style. Transformation of peasants’ life style to townspeople’s life style is the symbol of modern civilization. The degree of spirit civilization is the important index of urbanization. The paper analyses the change of peasants’ life style and the conditions of spirit civilization of Shenzhen, and proposes concerned improvement measures.",1024719123, 关于深圳市城市化问题的研究,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, Huan YiWuYiHuanWu, Huan Yi吴以环", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709669581 , 70432352 , 189128 , H114414 , H114414", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, Chinese, Chinese, 关于深圳市城市化问题的研究,2001,PQDT - Global,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024719123?accountid=14496, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics,, 0503 Agricultural economics, Agricultural economics," (UMI)AAIH114414 , Social sciences , 城市 , 城市化 , 无 , 深圳市",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+the+Problem+of+Urbanization+of+Shenzhen&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Huan+Yi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3647,"'the right to have rights': gender politics, citizenship and the state in uruguay","The thesis comprises a historically-grounded analysis of gender politics in Uruguay. It analyses the extent to which women have been able to establish a controlling presence in politics - in terms of entry of institutional arenas and of the representation of their interests in the political agenda and policy-making process - by exploring the interplay between structure, discourse and agency. The first chapter provides a historical perspective, showing how, in the context of the construction of the modern state in Uruguay, the progressive social justice discourse of the hegemonic political sector together with pressure by organised women's groups led to early reforms promoting women's rights. The second chapter examines how the second-wave women's movement emerged, initially as part of the wider civil opposition to the military dictatorship (1973-1984), and then as a political actor in its own right, to press for the inclusion of its gender-specific demands as part of the democratic project. The final four chapters analyse the development of gender politics in different political arenas - the legislature, state and political parties - in the post-dictatorship period (1985-1997). The thesis argues that the continuing obstacles to the representation of women and their interests in politics are partly the result of persistent traditional assumptions about gender roles, but derive principally from the nature of the political system itself and changing conceptualisations of citizenship and state-civil society relations, influenced by the neo-liberal doctrine of individual liberty and minimal state intervention. By constructing unity in diversity as a collective political actor, developing a rights-based discourse and using international legal instruments for lobbying, the women's movement has won some institutional space and achieved the politicisation of certain gender issues, although these gains are far from consolidated.",1771771545,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, Charlotte NicolaJohnsonNicolaCharlotteJohnson, Charlotte Nicola", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3976465261 , 102765202 , 101309 , U156061 , U156061", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1771771545?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU156061 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27the+right+to+have+rights%27%3A+gender+politics%2C+citizenship+and+the+state+in+uruguay&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Charlotte+Nicola&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3648,The development of a southern whale fishery from britain between 1775 and 1815,"This thesis examines British involvement in the Southern Whale Fishery, which commenced in 1775 and over the next forty years resulted in Britain becoming the world leader in the industry. The main aims of this essentially empirical study are twofold: first, to reconstruct the historical geography of whaling by collecting and analysing primary records in order to fill a gap in our knowledge; and second, to place whaling - as a particular commercial activity carried out in the southern hemisphere from Britain during that period - in its wider social, historical and political context. The theoretical insights and concepts derived from contemporary historical geography that underpin the study and locate it in the discipline of geography are those of globalisation with particular reference to oceanic trade. Documentary analysis and interpretative narrative form are the principal methods used to collect, analyse and present the data. A detailed picture is presented of the networks of people, ships and products associated with whaling from Britain to the southern seas. Some of the geographies of that whaling world have been reconstructed at different spatial scales, both global and local, tracing the movement and flows of different social groups, commodities and capital in the development of the Fishery. The study identifies the significant political influences and key players that impacted on the global oceanic trading activities of the Fishery and how these operated at a local scale. The thesis also discusses the establishment, in 1792, of a whaling town at Milford in south west Wales by Nantucket Quaker families. The study shows how the Southern Whale Fishery, at that time, represented an important element of Britain’s contribution to world trade, a means of supplementing Britain’s naval power, the provision of opportunities for territorial expansion and the identification of new trade routes.",1809097228,,Dissertations & Theses," Clayton, J.

I examine ways contact improvisation remains a subculture practice and has emerged in mainstream frameworks to determine its influences and significance in the 1990s. I argue that contact improvisation sustained as an egalitarian community by preserving its vitality through rhetoric of a “natural body.” At the same time, contact improvisation contributes to new trends in post/modern dance by offering partnering skills, exploring issues of identity, and performing various choreographic representations of touch and weight. I raise issues of gender, sexuality, ability, race, and class to track changes in the sociopolitical climate by investigating contact improvisation as it arises in various choreographic circumstances and is performed by a range of bodies including “hired bodies,” dancers versed in a variety of techniques in order to meet the demands of contemporary choreographers; “contact” or “weighted bodies,” dancers schooled in the principles of contact improvisation; disabled dancers; and classically-trained ballet dancers. As an identifying-ethnography, I utilize embodied research along with choreographic analysis to illuminate contact improvisation as a particular movement language. I apply theories of transgression to illuminate ways that contact improvisation exposes and crosses boundaries of touch. Chapter One locates the current concerns of the community by highlighting the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the form at Oberlin College in 1997. Chapter Two investigates contact improvisation as a choreographic tool by delineating the form as technique, vocabulary, and practice. Chapter Three analyzes contact improvisation in relation to the historical trajectory of American modern dance and the overarching field of “release technique” to explore its “revolutionary” politics. Chapter Four examines contact improvisation in the global sphere where issues of gender, sexuality, universality, and commodification surface in various ways. I argue, as a metaphor, or currency, of corporeal exchange, contact improvisation paradoxically deepens universal ideologies of the body and serves as a model for understanding difference.",250813123,,Dissertations & Theses," Schaffman, Karen HelenSchaffmanHelenKarenSchaffman, Karen Helen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725902811 , 27553681 , 66569 , 9780493328645 , 0493328645 , 3021402 , 3021402", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493328645 , 0493328645", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250813123?accountid=14496, 0378 Dance, 0378 Dance, 0378 Dance,, 0378 Dance, Dance," Communication and the arts , Contact improvisation , Dance , Touch",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+the+margins+to+the+mainstream%3A++Contact+improvisation+and+the+commodification+of+touch&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schaffman%2C+Karen+Helen&amp;isbn=9780493328645&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3650,"Germans, Costa Ricans, or a question of dual nationalist sentiments? The German community in Costa Rica, 1850–1950","This dissertation examines the immigration and community formation of German settlers in Costa Rica from the mid-nineteenth through the mid-twentieth centuries and the extent to which they became integrated in their host society. It stipulates that German Costa Ricans established a dichotomous position in Costa Rica, as members of the local economic, social and political elite, yet proud members of a Costa Rican German community. Even the earliest German immigrants to Costa Rica in the mid- to late-nineteenth century established themselves as owners of large commercial firms that helped to expand Costa Rica's international trade. German Costa Ricans also branched out with large commercial agricultural enterprises involved in the production and processing of coffee and sugar, the nation's two most important export products. Participation in these economic enterprises aided German Costa Ricans in forging marriage ties and business partnerships with Costa Ricans that perpetuated their integration into an incipient Costa Rican agricultural elite. German Costa Ricans worked at the same time to establish a local German community. They founded a German Club, School, and Welfare Society, that helped them to maintain their language and culture and perpetuated a strong sense of “Germanness,” which they then passed on to their Costa Rican born children. This powerful foreign community had a significant impact on this history of the Central American nation. I argue that the perpetuation of “Germanness” combined with the connection of influential members of the German community to the Costa Rican government, led directly to the infiltration of Nazi propaganda and influence in Costa Rican in the 1930s. The penetration of Nazism among some members of the German community in turn created the fear of a local “Fifth Column” movement. These fears then forced the Costa Rican government to take action against local Germans after Costa Rica entered World War II on the side of the allies. I further explain that the pre-World War II perpetuation of Deutschtum and the government actions this warranted led Germans to shed their “Germanness,” and to become more fully assimilated into Costa Rican society, after the end of the war.",250830444,,Dissertations & Theses," Nemcik, Christine CarolNemcikCarolChristineNemcik, Christine Carol", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726314081 , 26811281 , 66569 , 9780493518558 , 049351855X , 3038513 , 3038513", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493518558 , 049351855X", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250830444?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Latin American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Community , Costa Rica , Dual nationalist , German , Immigration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Germans%2C+Costa+Ricans%2C+or+a+question+of+dual+nationalist+sentiments%3F+The+German+community+in+Costa+Rica%2C+1850%E2%80%931950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nemcik%2C+Christine+Carol&amp;isbn=9780493518558&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3651,"Self, language, and the body: Literary case studies from Flaubert to Ernaux","This project traces representations of medical treatments in French fiction from Flaubert to Ernaux as they evolve in connection with changing notions of self, medicine, and the body. My analyses trace this shift in terms of medical treatments represented and the writing cure. As science develops, treatments reflect the introduction of specializations and technological advances. A division remains between routine practices and more extreme measures. In Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Émile Zola's Nana , the limits of reason appear in an inability to cure or treat all physical—and psychological—ailments. Growing disappointment, strong during times of personal and collective trauma, carries over into traditional medical practices and the medical profession, in general. What I call the “writing cure” embodies the transition from medical institutions to lay-attempts at cure. Beginning with Emma's dreaming cure and moving to the psychoanalytic talking cure, I argue for a drive among protagonists and narrators to treat themselves after conventional therapies fail. Le Docteur Pascal anticipates the specific alternative of a “writing cure.” Narrators in André Breton's Nadja , Louis-Ferdinand Céline's Voyage au bout de la nuit , and Albert Camus's La Peste are faced with physical and moral contagion on a global scale. These doctors' lives and practices are put into question, revealing the limits of medicine. André Gide's L'Immoraliste , Camus's La Chute , and Jean-Paul Sartre's La Nausée present a further move away from medicine on the part of lay narrators who see writing or talking as a way to confess. Marguerite Duras's Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein intentionally manipulates aspects of voice as a male doctor writes a case study about a woman, with a female author increasingly present behind his words. In Passion simple , Annie Ernaux's narrator reconstructs conflict in order to work through and move beyond trauma. The movement in fictional representations from physical to more abstract or psychological therapies reflects social and historical changes of medical treatment in nineteenth- and twentieth-century France. The stark realization that medicine, even with its discoveries, still cannot resolve human mortality or cure the innermost sufferings of the soul compels characters to undertake the “writing cure.”",251643531,,Dissertations & Theses," Rawson, Gay Gardner ZoldesyRawsonGardner ZoldesyGayRawson, Gay Gardner Zoldesy", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729003691 , 27552651 , 66569 , 9780493192123 , 0493192123 , 3009630 , 3009630", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493192123 , 0493192123", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/251643531?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0298 Literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0298 Literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0298 Literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0298 Literature"," Comparative literature , Romance literature , Literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Annie Ernaux , Body , Ernaux, Annie , Flaubert, Gustave , France , Gustave Flaubert , Language , Self",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Self%2C+language%2C+and+the+body%3A++Literary+case+studies+from+Flaubert+to+Ernaux&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rawson%2C+Gay+Gardner+Zoldesy&amp;isbn=9780493192123&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3652,For all our relations: Ecofeminist and indigenous challenges to sustainable development,"For All Our Relations presents a dual challenge to the field of Christian Ethics and the emerging paradigm of sustainable development. The debate over sustainable development (the international movement to make economic and social development environmentally sustainable) provides a theoretical and practical locus to explore the interactions between environmental sustainability, economic equity, and the rights of disenfranchised peoples. A small number of Christian ethicists have been exploring these questions, seeking to integrate the demands of a viable earth ethics with the requirements for just political economy. The dissertation argues, however, that both Christian ethicists and sustainable development advocates suffer from a serious blind spot. Neither has adequately attended to the marginalized voices of the people most impacted by the complex crises of culture and nature confronting our world. This dissertation focuses on two of these constituencies: indigenous peoples and women. Taking an ecofeminist approach, the thesis brings the voices of ecofeminists, women activists, and indigenous peoples into dialogue with the mainstream paradigm of sustainable development. Through focusing on three policy areas: land rights, preservation of endangered cultures, and biodiversity conservation, the thesis argues that a provisional consensus has emerged among ecofeminists and indigenous peoples which challenges fundamental presuppositions embedded in sustainable development discourse. By egg the challenges posed by ecofeminists and indigenous peoples to sustainable development and Christian ethics, the thesis indicates that a double transformation is required if humanity is to live sustainably and equitably within the broader earth community. First, our globalizing capitalist culture with its religious adherence to the gospel of “free trade” and “property rights” must learn to respect and protect non-Western and indigenous cultures, which value people over profits, the well-being of all over the flourishing of the few, and harmony with the earth rather than dominion over it. Second, the thesis calls for the transformation of Christianity into a genuine “earth faith.” Finally, the dissertation calls for a theo-ethical shift which includes the recovery of the sense of the sacred in the natural world, the recognition of the agency and moral standing of non-human creatures, and respect for diversity as a key moral norm.",251710980,,Dissertations & Theses," Parker, Janet LynnParkerLynnJanetParker, Janet Lynn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729005631 , 27534251 , 66569 , 9780493190259 , 0493190252 , 3009996 , 3009996", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493190259 , 0493190252", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/251710980?accountid=14496," 0469 Theology , 0453 Womens studies , 0768 Environmental science"," 0469 Theology , 0453 Womens studies , 0768 Environmental science"," 0469 Theology , 0453 Womens studies , 0768 Environmental science",," 0469 Theology , 0453 Womens studies , 0768 Environmental science"," Theology , Womens studies , Environmental science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Ecofeminist , Ethics , Indigenous , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=For+all+our+relations%3A++Ecofeminist+and+indigenous+challenges+to+sustainable+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Parker%2C+Janet+Lynn&amp;isbn=9780493190259&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3653,Networks of capital and influence: A critical social inquiry into the field of management consulting,"In 1998, management consulting was approximately a $90 billion industry growing at a rate of over 20% per year with more than 70,000 management consultants in the United States alone and over 140,000 worldwide. Yet, it has been both underresearched and largely undiscussed outside the inner circles of the field itself. Using a critical interpretive approach, this study uses empirical data from informant interviews with consultants and clients, secondary data from a variety of sources, and participant observation and case studies to examine the field of management consulting from historical, descriptive, structural, and cultural perspectives. Exploring the field within the framework of Pierre Bourdieu's theory of practice in combination with social network theory, the research question guiding this inquiry was: What are the properties, dimensions, and dynamics of the various species of capital operating within the field of management consulting; how are these species of capital interrelated and to what effect? The findings were: (a) empirical findings descriptive of how the field is structured, how it operates, and the extent of its reach, scope, and influence in contemporary society—including such factors as practice arrangements, areas of practice and practice structures, consulting firm structures and economic models, recruitment, selection, retention and movement, compensation, orientation and training, the consulting process, tools of the trade, the consulting life, the language of management consulting, educational credentials, and roles and relationships; (b) identification of a “culture of smartness” and its properties and dynamics; and (c) insights into the role networks of capital play in creating and reproducing this culture and diffusing the influence of management consulting throughout society. A historical analysis provides contextual background; structural, cultural, and critical analyses derive from this context and the empirical findings. The conclusion drawn from these levels of analysis is that management consultants occupy elite status in contemporary capitalist society and function as part of the “collective intelligentsia” (Mannheim) of our time. However, this role is played from behind-the-scenes among the elite levels of power and influence in all institutional sectors of society. While having a significant impact on thought, practice, and culture on an increasingly global scale, it is a role played largely outside the public view, consciousness, and discourse, thereby rendering the role and influence of management consulting in contemporary society “invisible” and unchallenged.",252110876,,Dissertations & Theses," LeTrent-Jones, Tony GuptonLeTrent-JonesGuptonTonyLeTrent-Jones, Tony Gupton", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726092511 , 27535881 , 66569 , 9780493446509 , 0493446508 , 3032091 , 3032091", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493446509 , 0493446508", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/252110876?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Social structure , Management , Cultural anthropology , Management consultants , Studies , Industry profiles"," Social sciences , Management consulting , Networks of capital",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Networks+of+capital+and+influence%3A++A+critical+social+inquiry+into+the+field+of+management+consulting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=LeTrent-Jones%2C+Tony+Gupton&amp;isbn=9780493446509&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3654,"Spheres of influence and academic networks: A history of official Australian aid to the University of the South Pacific (USP), 1960–1990","This dissertation examined the concept of autonomy and the University of the South Pacific (USP). It explored the significance of USP as a university created by a colonial power, supported by foreign aid, and its development in the South Pacific region. From a historical perspective, the period is significant in that the USP was created during the last days of colonialism and later merged into an international system. The purpose in taking this research back to 1960 was to add an account of the events leading up to the institutionalization of the USP, the particular effects of colonialism in the South Pacific region, and the postcolonial implications of developing higher education there. This dissertation addressed three issues. How significant is the location of the USP in Suva to its role in the region? Is the model of core/periphery being applied behind the mask of intellectual freedom? Does the USP remain a colonial construction or has it developed into an autonomous institution? This research presented a qualitative study using archives and special collections in Australia and Fiji. The change in Australian aid policy over time became evident in the process of reviewing policy documents. Debate was easily traceable in documents from the archives of the USP. Interviews provided synthesis with the archives and policy documents enriching the data from these primary sources. Theoretical analysis added depth to looking at the region from the vantage of spheres of influence and agency. What is crucial in this dissertation is how the USP has been affected by shifting spheres of influence. The theoretical context of shifting spheres of influence focuses on the movement of influence in education through various countries' economic, social, and political power. In this case study, Great Britain, Australia, and Fiji are the focus of these shifts. Through this theoretical lens, it becomes evident that it is not mere incident that Fiji is a developing core, and spheres of influence, particularly in the South Pacific region, are always connected, contested, and infinitely more complex than imagined in an orthodox core-periphery model.",275800493,,Dissertations & Theses," Cassity, Elizabeth AnneCassityAnneElizabethCassity, Elizabeth Anne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728471891 , 26811591 , 66569 , 9780493151922 , 0493151923 , 3005696 , 3005696", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493151922 , 0493151923", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275800493?accountid=14496," 0745 Higher education , 0332 History , 0520 Education history"," 0745 Higher education , 0332 History , 0520 Education history"," 0745 Higher education , 0332 History , 0520 Education history",," 0745 Higher education , 0332 History , 0520 Education history"," Higher education , History , Education history"," Social sciences , Education , Academic networks , Aid , Australian , Fiji , University of the South Pacific",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spheres+of+influence+and+academic+networks%3A++A+history+of+official+Australian+aid+to+the+University+of+the+South+Pacific+%28USP%29%2C+1960%E2%80%931990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cassity%2C+Elizabeth+Anne&amp;isbn=9780493151922&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3655,"Models of capitalism, complexity and postindustrialism: the case of unified Germany. (BL)","This thesis challenges the misconceptions of most contemporary accounts of the German capitalism, and develops a new framework for analysing the German Model in the contemporary period. Between 1989/90 and 1998 debates on the political economy of unified Germany have tended to argue that the German Model of capitalism is no longer viable in the global economy. Alternatively, accounts which defend the German Model fail to recognise the genuine characteristics of unified Germany. Part One of this study criticises the analysis of conventional defences of the German Model in two ways. Conventional accounts are unitary, they focus solely on the autarkic or large firm centred view of German industrialism and ignore the complexity of German capitalism which exists within Germany on account of the different paths taken to industrialism and the post-WWII division and subsequent unification of Germany. Conventional accounts of German capitalism are industrial, they regard the German Model of capitalism not to have been affected by the postindustrial transitions. This study challenges these two misrepresentations of the German Model and, by combining institutionalist theories from political economy with postindustrial theory from sociology a new framework for analysing post-unification Germany is created. The outcome of this synthesis is a four-part model labelled Coexisting Postindustrial Trajectories. It is argued that unified Germany will succeed as an economy in the current phase of capitalism if these trajectories are permitted to coexist on equal terms. Part Two of this thesis identifies the challenge of complexity and postindustrialism on the organisations and institutions of social partnership which characterise the German Model. The appropriateness of trade union responses to these dynamics is assessed through two case studies. The first looks at the response of the trade union movement to the events of 1989.

(BL: DXN056756),"In this thesis, I examine the relationship between environmentalism and place. Studies suggest that this relationship is significant, especially at the local level, where hundreds and thousands of place-based associations have been formed since the Rio Summit in 1992. After drawing attention to the place differences within the wider movement and considering these in the light of globalisation, localisation and relocalisation, I look at four local environmental organisations in York. These have been chosen because they reflect the basic types of environmentalism in general, as well as the scope and diversity of environmentalism in York. I discuss my involvement with the groups, as a participant observer and interviewer. I also attempt to articulate the ways in which their aims and objectives - as well as their achievements - are determined (as in 'decided' or 'completed' as well as 'altered' or 'modified') by the nature of York as a place. I start from the premise that place provides local environmentalists with a 'perspective' and 'experiential centre' (Harvey, 1996). Global environmental discourses and problems are perceived and acted upon through the 'medium' or 'prism' of place, which 'saturates' or 'mediates' local environmentalism (Gieryn, 2000). The influence of the wider movement and its 'associated penumbra' (Purdue et al, 1997), as well as that of other social processes and phenomena such as globalisation and restructuring, is also altered or modified by place. However, because the nature of place is both 'place-specific' and 'case-specific', it is also extremely difficult to generalise about - a dilemma that can only be resolved by conducting further research.",301567624,,Dissertations & Theses," Nelson, D.NelsonD.Nelson, D.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759196671 , 44901391 , 101309 , U153109 , U153109", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301567624?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure," BL: DXN056756 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Environmentalism+emplaced%3A++a+sociological+exploration+of+environmentalism+in+York.+%28BL%3A+DXN056756%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nelson%2C+D.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3657,"Process analysis of a total literacy campaign in india: a case study of udaipur district, rajasthan","The National Literacy Mission (NLM) of the Government of India adopted the Total Literacy Campaign (TLC) model as the main policy instrument for eliminating adult illiteracy in the 1990s.

In the first, efforts to eradicate adult illiteracy in the global context, and in India in particular, are examined with a view to providing the primary rationale for the current field of study. The origin of the TLC model as it has emerged is reviewed as India's distinctive contribution to the global pool of experience. Particular attention is given to the issue of replicability of the model in different social contexts. The second section is primarily devoted to presenting some contextual background of the case study, including the methodological considerations and logistic realities of conducting the field research. The emergence of TLC in Rajasthan and the achievement of Udaipur district as reported by the NLM are examined in detail. It is argued that the 'quality' of TLC is not properly judged through the current evaluation scheme built into the model. The types of insight into the process of the TLC sought by this researcher may be the natural domain of the interpretive paradigm underlying qualitative strategies. The final section presents the research findings to emerge from the fieldwork, analysing local TLC practices of six sample villages and their responses to the campaign strategies presented by the district authority. It turns out that Udaipur TLC may share in its approach and strategies more with the top-down government programme than with the campaign 'movement', and the gap between policy and practice of each campaign becomes even more apparent at the village level. Considering the multi-faced nature of the TLC, findings are examined from the six operational stages of the campaign implementation, according to which suggestions for future planning are also presented.",301574269,,Dissertations & Theses," Yagi, RieYagiRieYagi, Rie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759078531 , 44864031 , 101309 , U141018 , U141018", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301574269?accountid=14496, 0745 Higher education, 0745 Higher education, 0745 Higher education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0745 Higher education, Higher education," (UMI)AAIU141018 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Process+analysis+of+a+total+literacy+campaign+in+india%3A+a+case+study+of+udaipur+district%2C+rajasthan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yagi%2C+Rie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3658,"Church, state and the aboriginal rights movement in taiwan: a case study of the paiwan","This fieldwork was conducted in southern Taiwan, mainly in the village of Piuma, among the aboriginal Paiwan people. The dissertation examines the influence on the Paiwan society of national and international practices and institutions: namely the church, state and Fourth World movements. It details how the Paiwan people actively engage in these social domains that seem to be beyond their control. The globalizing discourses of Presbyterian egalitarianism, state democratic representation and universal human rights, however, do not necessarily diminish local diversity but can sometimes encourage it. These external influences have also helped to create new social and political arenas in which the rhetorics of tradition are adopted and in which local conceptions of what it means to be Paiwanese are re-affirmed and contested, a process that may be seen as 'tradition in the making'. The processes described here follow a pattern recognizable in other parts of the world (e.g., North American and Australia) but are substantially differ in terms of the dynamic tension (or articulation) between local indigenous hierarchy and the egalitarianism of 'external' ideologies. The dissertation proceeds from local through national to transnational politics. The first chapter describes the contexts under which I conducted my fieldwork. In the following two chapters, I use naming practices and a local cultural revival organisation to illustrate Paiwan hierarchy and how it functions in contemporary life. Chapter two examines how the people of Piuma construct relationships through names which are hierarchically ordered, and how names are linked to particularistic loyalties (and hence indigenous political dynamics). Chapter three analyzes the rise and fall of the Cultural Revival Committee in Piuma, and how this new organisation became entangled with the politics of status competition among members of high-ranking houses, who resort to myth and history to legitimise their respective claims. The effort to revive a collective past collapse, due to different perceptions of that past. In the following three chapters, I examine differential dynamical articulations between Paiwan hierarchical and 'outside' egalitarian ideologies.",301578490,,Dissertations & Theses," Ku, Kun-HuiKuKun-HuiKu, Kun-Hui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759042351 , 44837241 , 101309 , U148507 , U148507", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301578490?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAIU148507 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Church%2C+state+and+the+aboriginal+rights+movement+in+taiwan%3A+a+case+study+of+the+paiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ku%2C+Kun-Hui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3659,"The practice, power and poetics of direct action","The thesis begins with a discussion of the Trident nuclear weapons system, now Britain's only nuclear weapons. It continues by looking at the ways in which the tactics used by police and courts support these nuclear weapons. I suggest that this is often based on a desire to purify space. For police this is largely through surveillance, arrest and detention. In the courts, domination is based on the limitation of acceptable legal discourses to the rational, visual and cognitive. It is impossible to create a perfect regime of control, and this opens up opportunities for resistance in the ""gaps in the map"". Following Bey (1991), I suggest that Faslane Peace Camp operates as a ""Temporary Autonomous Zone"". I also discuss fence cutting, graffiti, lock-ons, and the use of political songs, as specific direct action tactics. These tactics often involve the ""practical deconstruction"" of boundaries. Continuing the discussion of singing, I discuss some of the ways in which singing in police custody can provide a form of personal empowerment. I look beyond purely individual models of resistance and empowerment, and suggest that singing also plays a vital part in the construction, and structuring, of communities. Drawing on my experiences at the St. George's Hill land squat in Surrey, and the use of The world Turned Upside Down, I discuss how these communities many be based on various ""ideals"", such as the mutual aid of social anarchism. They are, however, always permeated by conflicts and exclusions. Moreover, even these ideals remain problematic. The use of ""affinity groups"", and consensus decision-making, are further ways in which communities of resistance are structured. Again, there is a conflict between these ideals, and the way in which the communities are actually practiced. I also include a discussion of the ways in which the ""international community"" has been created as a geopolitical discourse, and the ways in which the anti-nuclear movement has engaged with the concept.",301595656,,Dissertations & Theses," Heller, DavidHellerDavidHeller, David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759138961 , 44882311 , 101309 , U150812 , U150812 , http://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:10471", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301595656?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:10471 , BL: DXN053487 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+practice%2C+power+and+poetics+of+direct+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heller%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3660,"The clandestine struggle for the eastern mediterranean and the middle east: italian subversion, arab nationalism and british counter-intelligence, 1935-1940","This study seeks to address the nature of propaganda and subversive activities organised by Fascist Italy in the Mediterranean and the Middle East during the interwar period, and in particular in the last five years preceding Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940. The approach taken is that of international history, drawing upon the limited and elusive archival materials to establish a chain of causation over time. Where possible this dissertation seeks to reach out beyond the political where the analysis of the Italian propaganda machine and its undertakings can be expanded to permit an examination of the associated social and cultural conditions of the geographical areas targeted by Mussolini's expansionist foreign policy. Several main themes run parallel in this study: the imperial dimension of Britain's foreign policy, and the British determination to preserve and defend the strategic core of the empire; Italian propaganda - here regarded as an instrument employed to further Mussolini's imperialistic ambitions, the challenge brought by Fascist Italy to the precarious equilibrium of political forces within the British empire; finally the rise of an increasingly powerful pan-Arab nationalist movement whose political significance was not always fully appreciated by British observers. Ultimately this study seeks to demonstrate that the demise of British influence in the Mediterranean and the Middle East was not greatly accelerated by the activities of Fascist propagandists, which proved to be short-lived, even though Italian propaganda had been supported by a sophisticated and efficiently co-ordinated structure. Instead, Britain's continued fascination with the old elites - the princes and pashas of the region - and its corresponding inability to adequately interact with new political forces emerging within the empire and the mandatory territories, continued to undermine British influence in a region of great strategic significance.",301622493,,Dissertations & Theses," Maglio, ManuelaMaglioManuelaMaglio, Manuela", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1758949221 , 44837421 , 101309 , U139382 , U139382", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301622493?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU139382 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+clandestine+struggle+for+the+eastern+mediterranean+and+the+middle+east%3A+italian+subversion%2C+arab+nationalism+and+british+counter-intelligence%2C+1935-1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maglio%2C+Manuela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3661,Immigration in post-communist Europe: Greece and Albanian migratory movement. (BL: DXN050645),"This thesis is about Greece and the Albanian migratory movement after 1990. It concentrates on the analysis of three core issues. Firstly, it explores the causes for the rise of the migration flow from Albania. Secondly, it examines the dynamics behind Greece's policy response towards this movement. Thirdly, it investigates how effective this policy response has been. The discussion of these issues is set within the context of a consideration of wider European reactions to new migration flows in the post-Cold-War era. The theoretical framework used in this thesis includes models from the literature on international migration which seek to explain the causes of the phenomenon, as well as concepts derived from the public policy approach of policy failure. The empirical research was based on semi-structured elite interview, while a wide-range of primary and secondary literature was used to provide context for the analysis and to compliment the research findings. In relation to the causality of the Albanian immigration into Greece the research revealed that this has to be appreciated in a multi-dimensional way, given that a number of causes were identified. Similarly, for adequately understanding the country's policy response towards this population movement, a variety of factors have to be taken into account (such as economic, social, foreign affairs, and others). Finally the thesis concludes that overall, Greece's immigration policy response may be defined as largely ineffective, as significant problems were found to characterise its formation, implementation and general performance. The thesis also demonstrated the value of linking analytical tools from different academic disciplines (migration theories from geography; policy failure from politics), in achieving higher levels of explanatory capability.",301623857,,Dissertations & Theses," Konidaris, G.KonidarisG.Konidaris, G.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759127661 , 44837561 , 101309 , U146365 , U146365", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301623857?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," (UMI)AAIU146365 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Immigration+in+post-communist+Europe%3A++Greece+and+Albanian+migratory+movement.++%28BL%3A+DXN050645%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Konidaris%2C+G.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3662,"Outside the Abbey: the Irish national theatres, 1897-1913.","This thesis examines debates on Irish national representation in the Abbey Theatre and in a range of alternative theatres set up at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century. It documents in particular the development of a new social role for theatres, signalled by their aspirations to be representative of the Irish nation. In this context the Irish Literary Theatre created its own niche as an 'independent' theatre. It initiated a more extensive debate on the function of a national theatre, and led to the establishment of the Irish National Theatre Society and the Abbey Theatre. The thesis demonstrates that the concept of a national theatre was variously interpreted according to the interests of individual groups: the Gaelic League and Daughters of Erin revived rural performance traditions, the National Players presented drama of a more patriotic cast, and the Players' Club focused on modernist international drama. Moreover, the Ulster Literary Theatre challenged the Abbey Theatre's monolithic concept of a nation, with productions that addressed rather than avoided sectarian issues. The Theatre of Ireland emerged out of disagreements with W.B. Yeat's autocratic policies in the Abbey Theatre and for a while competed successfully for national theatre status. Padraic Pearse's plays displayed a distinctly Catholic identity, the Markieviczs presented middle class urban plays and patriotic Irish drama, and Johanna Redmond's mildly nationalist plays illustrated that in the new political climate of a pending third Home Rule Bill patriotic drama became 'respectable' on the Irish stage. In its examination of the alternative theatre movement, the thesis highlights a fundamental shift in the concept of ""national theatre,"" from a position centred on cultural prestige to one that encompasses the wider concerns of national representation. The movement of the Abbey Theatre along this track was by no means as smooth as suggested by Lady Gregory in Our Irish Theatre (1913). By that time, however, its international reputation and pivotal role in Irish drama meant that Irish audiences unofficially sanctioned its national theatre status.",301632840,,Dissertations & Theses," Vandevelde, K.VandeveldeK.Vandevelde, K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759077421 , 44863551 , 101309 , U140796 , U140796", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301632840?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications,, 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," (UMI)AAIU140796 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Outside+the+Abbey%3A++the+Irish+national+theatres%2C+1897-1913.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vandevelde%2C+K.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3663,The aesthetics of cultural modernisation: hindi cinema in the 1950s,"This thesis questions classic notions of culture as ‘representation of contemporary reality’ and the traditional, linear periodisation of art-historical series. Film criticism, caught (a) in a strictly synchronic notion of the relationship between social relations and cultural forms and (b) in the assumption that author and viewer are fully modern subjects, is unable to cope with cinemas the narrative strategies of which do not correspond to those of Western cinema. By way of a preliminary investigation of the relation between the forms of Indian cinema and their multiple historical reference points, this thesis demonstrates the productivity of an approach based on two hypotheses. The first is that capitalist modernisation, that is to say, the historical constellation that led to the emergence of the cinema’s narrative strategies, is not a linear movement towards a society the socio-economic modalities of which are tacitly understood to be those in place in Western societies, but a field of tension in which the long-term trajectory of a society towards a broadly defined form of capitalism within a global economy is determined by the short-term struggles between the specific forces at work in that society. The second hypothesis is that narration consists, among other things, of orchestrating historically layered forms of enunciation that remain available to each of the temporalities and power blocs constitutive of a given constellation. As a consequence, cultural forms may or may not reflect a dominant economic and/or political configuration at any one time. It is precisely in this struggle between concurring (dominant and non-dominant) forces over the power to fix the meaning of forms, that texts can be seen not to ‘reflect’ or to ‘trigger’, but to ‘stage’ historical conditions and, in the process, to mediate within themselves the struggles that shape the ‘outside’ of textual production. This ‘outside’ context is then to be reconceptualised as the conjunction of positions and preoccupations narrativised according to the resources made available by the short, medium and long term historical currents at work within it. These are the premises that are necessary for the comparative study of cinemas from different cultures and epochs to become visible on the horizon of film theory.",301635991,,Dissertations & Theses," Vitali, ValentinaVitaliValentinaVitali, Valentina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759885731 , 44850761 , 101309 , U162210 , U162210", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301635991?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," DXN060087 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+aesthetics+of+cultural+modernisation%3A+hindi+cinema+in+the+1950s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vitali%2C+Valentina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3664,"A Catholic Unionist: the life and times of William Monsell, first Baron Emly of Tervoe (1812-1894).","This dissertation is the biography of one of the most significant, yet one of the most over-looked, political figures of nineteenth century Ireland.

Considerable attention is given to his periods as an office holder, especially in the 1850s at the Board of Ordnance, and between 1868 and 1873, at the Colonial and Post Offices. There is also measured consideration on his international role, his involvement in the Liberal Catholic movement as a European figure, and his concern for political, religious and social equality, for Catholics and the Irish people.

Originated in the “enslaved” columns of Vitruvius, incorporated in Renaissance doctrines of proportion, echoed in classical theories of physiognomy and caractère and scientifically researched in the formulations of empathy theory in nineteenth-century German aesthetics, discussions of pneumatism, spiritism or animism of forms have proved to be implicitly central in the foundational discourses of art and architectural theory. However, starting with the physiological conception of the sublime in the eighteenth-century, the “body metaphor” mutated from a harmonious exterior morphology into an organic inner pathology affecting the organisms of statues, buildings and modern metropolises. Within this shifting ground, in fin-de-siècle Europe, the artistic drive, Alois Riegl's Kunstwollen , presents an inflection, marking the shift from empathy theory to what Wilhelm Worringer calls “the uncanny pathos for the animation of the inorganic.” My main argument, is that empathy, the ability for identification with the external world, was fundamentally repressed by modern egos, thus, it had to return metamorphically projected and reified into the inorganic form of the animistic artifacts of twentieth-century modernism. The dissertation has two sections.

Both of these organizations have been described as “place-based” meaning that their origins, the collaboration between their members, and the bases of their forest management plans are all grounded in relationship to particular locales. This dissertation explores the dynamics of conflict and collaboration associated with these two place-based efforts. I present a way of seeing place in both spatial (local/non-local) and temporal (past/present/future) dimensions. Seeing place in this way allows me to move beyond the typical accounts of the QLG, as merely the conflict between local and national control of national forests, and the MCDG, as merely the conflict between tradition and modernity in forest management and the reconstitution of the Maidu nation. I examine the role of place in the mobilization of the MCDG and the QLG, in their forest management plans and management areas (the Maidu Stewardship Area and the QLG Area), the means of legitimating these plans and areas, and the dynamics of conflict and collaboration that arose in the attempts to put these plans and areas “on the ground.” In telling these two tales, I hope to open up new opportunities for the study of “place-based” natural resource management—how such efforts form and change, how they devise and employ their rhetorical and material tactics, and why they evoke certain relations of conflict and collaboration. Seeing place as a zone of contact between dialectical elements of local and national/global, and tradition and modernity, I hope to support a more dynamic analysis of the community forestry phenomenon in the United States; one that is relevant to both practitioners, and to the theoretical realms of political economy, social movements, cultural politics, and the politics of nature.",304685753,,Dissertations & Theses," London, Jonathan K.LondonK.JonathanLondon, Jonathan K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726337731 , 27191861 , 66569 , 9780493584478 , 0493584471 , 3044572 , 3044572", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493584478 , 0493584471", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304685753?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0700 Social structure , 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0700 Social structure , 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0700 Social structure , 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Social structure , Geography , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , California , Collaboration , Community forestry , Conflict",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Placing+conflict+and+collaboration+in+community+forestry&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=London%2C+Jonathan+K.&amp;isbn=9780493584478&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3667,"Muenzenberg. Rise and fall of a Communist tycoon, 1917--1940","“Münzenberg. Rise and Fall of a Communist Tycoon, 1917–1940” chronicles the political career of Willy Münzenberg, one of the leading propagandists of the Communist International (Comintern) in the 1920s and 1930s. Drawing extensively on recently opened archives in Moscow and the former Eastern Bloc, this dissertation sheds new light on Comintern finances, propaganda strategy, and especially on Münzenberg's use of ostensibly independent “front organizations” to infiltrate non-Communist circles in European politics. It also contributes to our understanding of the breakdown of democracy in the Weimar Republic in Germany, in which Münzenberg's shadow propaganda empire played a significant role. The argument runs as follows. Because Münzenberg, as an old friend of Lenin's from wartime Zürich, had easier access to “Moscow gold” than most of his party colleagues, his conversion to the Communist cause after World War I had especially potent repercussions for European, and especially German, politics. Although none of Münzenberg's (ostensibly) “non-Communist” media ventures (newspapers, illustrated periodicals, film distribution companies, book clubs, etc.) made money or came close to breaking even, their very ubiquity was seen as a threat by anti-Communists on both the Left and the Right—most of whom had no doubt that these ventures were, in fact, Communist. Münzenberg, labeled a “Communist Hugenberg” (in reference to a notorious right-wing German media baron of that name), became a potent symbol of the Bolshevik invasion of the European Left, which not only weakened the various Social Democratic parties (whose leaders refused to ally with Moscow) but also lent crucial rhetorical ammunition to aggressively revanchist movements of the Right like Hitler's Nazis. By the last years of the Weimar Republic in the early 1930s, Münzenberg and his fellow Berlin resident and Nazi journalist counterpart, Joseph Goebbels, were firing off (mostly untruthful) propaganda salvoes tit for tat, feeding a destructive spiral of accusations and counter-accusations that poisoned the political atmosphere irrevocably. This was a dangerous political tango, in which the fate of Germany—and after her, all of Europe—was at stake. For the death and destruction that followed the collapse of democracy in central Europe in the 1930s, Münzenberg must share responsibility with the Nazi politicians who defeated him in the race for power. Contrary to the apologias published by many of Münzenberg's collaborators after his death in 1940, this man was no democrat. In the way he responded to his dramatic fall from Moscow's favor after 1937, no less than in his meteoric rise to political fame that preceded it, Willy Münzenberg was a Communist to the core.",304685857,,Dissertations & Theses," McMeekin, Sean AlexanderMcMeekinAlexanderSeanMcMeekin, Sean Alexander", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726337771 , 27190031 , 66569 , 9780493584652 , 049358465X , 3044591 , 3044591", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493584652 , 049358465X", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304685857?accountid=14496," 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies"," 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies"," 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies",," 0582 History , 0335 European history , 0304 Biographies"," History , European history , Biographies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Communist , Germany , Muenzenberg, Willy , Tycoon , Willy Muenzenberg",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Muenzenberg.+Rise+and+fall+of+a+Communist+tycoon%2C+1917--1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McMeekin%2C+Sean+Alexander&amp;isbn=9780493584652&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3668,"The political economy of micro -enterprise promotion policies: Restructuring and income -generating activities in El Alto, Bolivia","In countries like Bolivia, development is the tenet to eradicate poverty, and micro-enterprises (MEs) are currently being presented as a mechanism to achieve this goal. This dissertation examines the politics of ME promotion in the city of El Alto, Bolivia and analyzes the practical and theoretical implications on a local and global scale. As the Bolivian government promotes individual entrepreneurial capacities as a means to democratize access to resources and improve the welfare of the poor it also maintains an economic policy that privileges the demands of globalized systems of production and consumption. Using qualitative and quantitative information obtained during field research (1998–1999), I explore points of tension between the local needs and the global demands. I utilize the current politics of ME promotion as a lens to analyze two ongoing processes: (1) the restructuring of economic and political institutions; (2) women's income generating strategies in El Alto. Based on my analysis of the first process, I establish how and why MEs have taken a prominent position in Bolivia's development policy. Based on second processes, I discuss the pitfalls and potentials of the concrete activities in the promotion of MEs in El Alto. To develop this analysis, I focus on concrete points of tension between national government development agendas, the activities of local organizations promoting MEs, and the ways in which women organize individual and collective economic activities in El Alto. The analysis of the primary and secondary data, based on interviews and a small survey, will be couched within the theoretical fields of globalization, gender and development, and social movements. A basic conclusion from this dissertation is that MEs are not inherently negative, but its promotion is currently framed in neo-liberal logic that supports practices that are deepening and reproducing poverty and discrimination. One of the purposes of these policies is to promote a flexible labor force under the guise of entrepreneurship and market competition. Furthermore, these policies have a tendency to transfer responsibility for poverty eradication away from state actions and policies to civil society and individual participation in the market.",304688378,,Dissertations & Theses," Arbona, Juan M.ArbonaM.JuanArbona, Juan M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725898961 , 26713471 , 66569 , 9780493320243 , 0493320245 , 3021346 , 3021346", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493320243 , 0493320245", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304688378?accountid=14496," 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0505 Business costs , 0617 Public administration"," 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0505 Business costs , 0617 Public administration"," 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0505 Business costs , 0617 Public administration",," 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development , 0505 Business costs , 0617 Public administration"," Urban planning , Area planning & development , Business costs , Public administration"," Social sciences , Bolivia , El Alto , Income-generating , Micro-enterprise , Political economy , Promotion policies , Restructuring",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+economy+of+micro+-enterprise+promotion+policies%3A++Restructuring+and+income+-generating+activities+in+El+Alto%2C+Bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arbona%2C+Juan+M.&amp;isbn=9780493320243&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3669,"Of divine import: The Maryknoll missionaries in Peru, 1943–2000","In the post World War II era fear of Communism and peasant-based revolutions which pervaded the western hemisphere contributed to religious and political leaders in Central and South America welcoming a veritable flood of foreign missionaries to their countries. It was believed that spiritual and material aid to the regions' poorest people would buttress a religious foundation, alleviate poverty, and promote modernization, thereby staving off the threat of Communism. My research examines the efforts of one mission organization, Maryknoll, to achieve these goals by transforming the predominantly indigenous people of Puno, Peru into modern Catholics and citizens. I examine the development of the missionaries' proselytization and modernization programs and the impact they had on Peru from 1943 to the present. In doing so, I illustrate how the Maryknoll mission movement and its influence were shaped by a combination of global changes that facilitated Maryknollers' settlement in Latin America, ideological influences stemming from the missionaries' communities of origin in the United States, and the missionaries' adaptation to local expectations about the role Catholic clergy should play in society. There was a reciprocal relationship between the missionaries and the people they proselytized so Maryknollers who sought to transform society in Puno by introducing “orthodox Catholicism” and modernization ultimately were transformed themselves. The Maryknoll missionaries who settled in Peru in 1943 were fierce American nationalists, virulent anti-Communists, and doctrinaire Catholics for whom Faith was evidenced by observance of Sacraments and obedience to hierarchy. The missionaries believed implicitly that by introducing their religious practices and elements of modernization including education, medical care, and credit cooperatives they would transform these backward highland regions into modern, progressive centers. By 1968, however, the Maryknollers' goals and ideals appeared transformed. They became vociferous critics of American policy, advocates of social change, and promoters of inter-cultural Catholic faith. My dissertation provides an analysis of global changes that influenced Maryknoll and the local contexts in which these changes were experienced and shows Maryknoll's impact on political and economic development in Peru.",304692710,,Dissertations & Theses," Fitzpatrick Behrens, Susan R.Fitzpatrick BehrensR.SusanFitzpatrick Behrens, Susan R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726116231 , 27505251 , 66569 , 9780493502571 , 0493502572 , 3036987 , 3036987", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493502571 , 0493502572", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304692710?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0336 Latin American history , 0318 Religion , 0330 Religious congregations , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Latin American history , Religion , Religious congregations , International law , International relations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Maryknoll , Missionaries , Modernization , Peru , Proselytization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Of+divine+import%3A++The+Maryknoll+missionaries+in+Peru%2C+1943%E2%80%932000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fitzpatrick+Behrens%2C+Susan+R.&amp;isbn=9780493502571&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3670,Labor activism and the promotion of a healthier work environment: The case of ergonomics in Brazil,"The main focus of this research project was the labor's role in the formulation and implementation of Ergonomic Programs developed by joint committees. Qualitative research methods and a social historic approach were applied in two Brazilian instrumental case studies in the service sector: (1) the Private Banking Industry; and (2) the Cashiers' workplace in Retail Food Stores. In both cases, unions were involved in a policymaking process for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders—MSDs through the application of ergonomic principles. It was found that the ability of both unions and the inspectorate agency to act effectively for a more protective work environment was limited. The policies formulated were not effectively implemented. Brazilian labor movement activism was constrained by external circumstances. There was a decrease in membership and therefore a tighter budget for union actions. Old labor achievements and workers' rights were threatened demanding an extra effort from the union to be maintained. Changes in production methods, in industry and workforce characteristics generated new union demands and forced the unions to promote fast changes in their agenda and OSH (occupational safety and health) issues were not a priority. Failures in the union actions with OSH concerns were also found. Most of the work on this theme was dependent on personal attitudes of unionists and was reactive. Many union leaders reported that OSH organizing threatens the current union leadership power. In addition, because MSDs primarily affected women, they did not receive support from male health professionals and male union leaders. Although the incidence of MSDs is also a product of ergonomic invisible hazards engendered by global and productive restructuring procedures at the point of production, these hazards remained unrecognized by many health professionals, union leaders and workers. Educational programs were required to promote organizing and raising awareness around at least three major issues: (a) the right to work in a healthier work environment; (b) new ergonomic invisible hazards, and (c) gender issues. Furthermore, a successful implementation of a preventive program required worker empowerment and shared commitment between management, the state, unions, and health professionals.",304697275,,Dissertations & Theses," Barreira, Thais Helena de CarvalhoBarreiraHelena de CarvalhoThaisBarreira, Thais Helena de Carvalho", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729003041 , 27523861 , 66569 , 9780493291512 , 0493291512 , 3018317 , 3018317", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493291512 , 0493291512", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304697275?accountid=14496," 0354 Occupational safety , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations"," 0354 Occupational safety , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations"," 0354 Occupational safety , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations",," 0354 Occupational safety , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations"," Occupational safety , Public health , Labor relations , Health promotion , Work environment , Ergonomics , Brazil"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Brazil , Ergonomics , Labor activism , Occupational health , Work",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Labor+activism+and+the+promotion+of+a+healthier+work+environment%3A++The+case+of+ergonomics+in+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barreira%2C+Thais+Helena+de+Carvalho&amp;isbn=9780493291512&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3671,The evolution of piano education in twentieth -century China with emphasis on Shanghai and Beijing conservatories,"Many brilliant Chinese pianists distinguished themselves on international concert stages since China opened its door to the West in the late 1970s. Being isolated both politically and culturally from the Western world for decades, how did Chinese musicians succeed in the pursuit of Western music? How were they trained? These questions became the main motivation for the current research. The purpose of the study is to trace the evolution of piano education since 1927, the year China saw the establishment of its first professional music institution—the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The chapters are organized chronologically. The dissertation starts with a brief account of the introduction of Western music and modern piano into China. As cradles for the musicians, the two principal conservatories are the focal points of this paper. Their establishment and the evolution, incorporated with their system and curriculum, are explored throughout the paper. Political movements and wars that closely affected the development of piano education in China are presented to portray the social environment and living condition of the musicians and the survival of the music institution. During China's isolation from the West, Russians were the major musical influence to the Chinese musicians. Since China resumed its diplomatic and cultural exchanges with the West in 1978, Chinese musicians are exposed to new perspectives and innovative methods of teaching. Foreign influences that are crucial to the evolution of piano education are discussed in different sections of the study. First and second-generation Chinese piano teachers were the main forces in the field of piano education. Biographical information of the major piano pedagogues from each generation and an insight view on their teaching philosophies were obtained through personal interviews and written documents. Cultural exchanges with the West brought about important realizations to the music educational system. Recommendations on the further advancement of piano education in China are offered by leading Chinese pedagogues in the concluding chapter.",304698892,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, AmyWangAmyWang, Amy", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729045271 , 27506751 , 66569 , 9780493221793 , 0493221794 , 3008052 , 3008052", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493221793 , 0493221794", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304698892?accountid=14496, 0522 Music education, 0522 Music education, 0522 Music education,, 0522 Music education, Music education," Education , Beijing , China , Conservatories , Piano education , Shanghai , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+evolution+of+piano+education+in+twentieth+-century+China+with+emphasis+on+Shanghai+and+Beijing+conservatories&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Amy&amp;isbn=9780493221793&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3672,"Axel Gallén and the constructed nation: Art and nationalism in young Finland, 1880–1900","The dissertation examines the intersection of art and politics in the work of Finland's national painter, Axel Gallén (1865–1931) (after 1907, Akseli Gallén-Kallela) during the pre-independence period that witnessed Finland's evolution from a buffer zone of the Russian empire into a self-conscious and determined modern nation. In contrast to earlier investigations of Gallén's art, the study focuses upon the inner mechanisms of regional nationalism (the politicization of an indigenous people's history and cultural heritage) as witnessed in the artist's appropriation of Finnish oral traditions and fading regional customs. Examined in detail are Gallén's relations to his patrons, French and German artistic circles, Finnish rural inhabitants of different social classes, and his colleagues in the nationalist Young Finland circle. The dichotomy between Finno-Swedish and Finno-Finnish culture as evinced in Gallén's art is considered as a civil conflict spawned by severe economic, social, and political inequities between different segments of the Finnish population historically. Also, the schism between city and country, mirrored in the clash between literate and oral cultures, is explored as a polarity that shaped Gallén's constructed image of modern Finland. A secondary objective of the dissertation is to re-evaluate misunderstood aspects of Gallén's career (his relation to European Naturalism and Symbolism, for example) and to introduce new documentary and visual material. The rediscovery of Gallén's 1880s masterpiece, Peasant Life (1887), which was thought destroyed in World War I, opens a new path for understanding the amalgamation of real and fictive elements in Gallén's naturalist works. Examining the significance of biblical motifs in the artist's 1890s works, neglected in earlier scholarship, illuminates the intersection of international and regional myths in late nineteenth-century Finnish art. Finally, an analysis of Gallén's mythological works inspired by Finland's national epic, the Kalevala, demonstrates how the artist refuted the autonomy of written language and assumed the mantel of a painter-creator within a shifting socio-political context. Although thematically and geopolitically anchored to Finnish terrain, the dissertation seeks to make a significant contribution to broader re-examinations of European nationalist movements and to investigations of art inspired by oral cultural traditions.",304707266,,Dissertations & Theses," Gallen-Kallela-Siren, Janne JormaGallen-Kallela-SirenJormaJanneGallen-Kallela-Siren, Janne Jorma", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727878861 , 26718631 , 66569 , 9780493056241 , 0493056246 , 9997454 , 9997454", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493056241 , 0493056246", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304707266?accountid=14496," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0377 Art History , 0335 European history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Art History , European history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Art , Finland , Gallen, Axel , Nationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Axel+Gall%C3%A9n+and+the+constructed+nation%3A++Art+and+nationalism+in+young+Finland%2C+1880%E2%80%931900&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gallen-Kallela-Siren%2C+Janne+Jorma&amp;isbn=9780493056241&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3673,"A critical ambivalence: Anti-Americanism in United States-Caribbean relations, 1958--1966","This study investigates the nature and impact of anti-U.S. sentiment in the Spanish Circum-Caribbean from 1958 to 1966. It defines anti-Americanism as mass-based protests directed against U.S. power abroad. It examines the roots of anti-Americanism and isolates variants in three case studies—the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the Panama riots in 1964, and the U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965. It also investigates the U.S. response to each of these crises. Multinational archival materials, interviews, periodicals, novels, and other sources demonstrate that the ambivalence of anti-U.S. criticism moderated its political effectiveness. Caribbean leaders were torn between strong positive and negative perceptions of the United States, and during crisis these perceptions inhibited their resolve and unity. Furthermore, Caribbean public opinion supported U.S. policies more than elites and revolutionaries said it did. Finally, Washington displayed a surprisingly coherent, consensual, and consistent ideological savvy in responding to foreign criticism, and the U.S. public was even more cocksure, hawkish, and nationalistic than its leaders. As a social and cultural sentiment, therefore, anti-Americanism was widespread and compelling, but as a political strategy it ran up not only against its own ambivalence but against the lack of ambivalence in U.S. counter-strategies. Anti-Americanism is a major ideological construct that provides a framework for understanding early movements of resistance to U.S. global domination. It moves beyond Cold War themes like revolution and communism and integrates cultural analyses into traditional diplomatic stories. In short, this study of anti-Americanism highlights three relatively timeless and perhaps universal themes—its ambivalence, its variability, and U.S. resilience.",304710087,,Dissertations & Theses," McPherson, Alan L.McPhersonL.AlanMcPherson, Alan L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728503681 , 27770001 , 66569 , 9780493173641 , 0493173641 , 3007845 , 3007845", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493173641 , 0493173641", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304710087?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0337 American history , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0337 American history , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0337 American history , 0336 Latin American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," American history , Latin American history , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Ambivalence , Anti-Americanism , Cuba , Dominican Republic , Panama , United States-Caribbean",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+critical+ambivalence%3A++Anti-Americanism+in+United+States-Caribbean+relations%2C+1958--1966&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McPherson%2C+Alan+L.&amp;isbn=9780493173641&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3674,Indigenous memory and imagination: Thinking beyond the nation,"This dissertation is a study of the ways in which cultural productions of indigenous women affect local, national and international discourses and is furthering an emergent hemispheric consciousness on the part of native people. The dissertation focuses on the novels of Leslie Marmon Silko, N. Scott Momaday, and a protest march and a video initiated by the cocaleras , the women coca growers, of Bolivia. The first chapter explores the question of an indigenous women's epistemology and deals with the issues of: (1) A comparison of the tribal social movements of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century that unified the eastern part of what is now the United States against increasing cultural and physical encroachment by the United States; (2) The imaginary topography of the United States that has been coded as the “space of death” because of the genocide that was perpetrated on indigenous people; (3) Analysis of two novels by N. Scott Momaday that played an influential role in shaping the identity politics of the 60s and 70s and contributed to the process of the masculinization of indigenous knowledges. The second chapter, “Indigenous Hemispheric Consciousness” deals with two of the novels written by Leslie Marmon Silko Ceremony and Almanac of the Dead which examine the concept of what I call an emergent “hemispheric consciousness.” This concept reinserts native women as active producers of knowledge and refeminizes the imaginary. Silko uses prophecy that allows access to a past that is like yesterday and a future that is known and spoken in the present moment. For Silko there is no single prophet, but ways of reading, deciphering, repairing and adding to the ancient texts of the Americas. The third chapter, “Postmodern Dystopias: The War on Drugs and Indians at the end of the Millennium”, stretches Silko's map south into Bolivia. It describes the situation in Bolivia during the 90s and its effects on indigenous people. The fourth chapter, “The War on Drugs is a War on Women,” records and analyzes a thirty-one day march planned and executed by the cocaleras in the Chapare region of Bolivia. By 1995 the militarization of the war on drugs had become unbearable because of the day by day disruption and violation of women's lives. The march marked a turning point for the ways in which indigenous women assert their citizenship.",304726057,,Dissertations & Theses," Bomberry, Victoria JeanBomberryJeanVictoriaBomberry, Victoria Jean", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725986441 , 26752301 , 66569 , 9780493381879 , 0493381872 , 3026776 , 3026776", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493381879 , 0493381872", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304726057?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies",," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies"," American literature , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Brazil , Imagination , Indigenous memory , Leslie Marmon Silko , Momaday, N.

Although no entirely uniform modernism takes hold throughout Latin America, important commonalities appear in the two cases examined: Brazilian modernismo and the Mexican vanguardias . I introduce the term ethos to analyze the ways in which these modernisms govern the dynamic between formal and socio-political concerns, between the aesthetic and the ethical. The key components of ethos appear in the four main chapters of my dissertation: locale, subjectivity, circulation, and a tug-of-war between documentation and invention. Each chapter examines a traditional genre that spans the visual and the literary, and that the avant-gardes reinvent in order to create this modernist ethos : landscape, portraiture, the (photo)essay, and fiction. The authors I examine make up, to a large degree, the canon of the Mexican and Brazilian avant-gardes. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on the importance of photography in the fiction and theory of the “father” of modernismo , Mário de Andrade; Chapters 3 and 4 examine the writings of the two major groups in Mexico, the estridentistas and the contemporáneos , especially Jaime Torres Bodet, Salvador Novo, Xavier Villaurrutia, and Arqueles Vela. Photography is, however, a relatively unknown and yet intensely important component in the work of these figures. In this project, I examine the broader implications of the medium in de Andrade's O turista aprendiz , a mixed-media, pseudo-ethnographic account of his travels into Brazil. I also analyze the material context of the Mexican avant-gardes' publications, which appeared in the midst of an explosion of photographs of women in the illustrated journal El Universal Ilustrado . While such a contact between image and word is typical of the international avant-gardes, the unique history of photography in Latin America creates a dense occupation of the space between the two. It is here that a modernist ethos emerges in which race and gender are formal and philosophical as well as social issues, and which leads to a reconsideration of photographic theory as well as of theories of the avant-garde.",304727476,,Dissertations & Theses," Gabara, Esther LeahGabaraLeahEstherGabara, Esther Leah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725986511 , 26724601 , 66569 , 9780493382449 , 0493382445 , 3026811 , 3026811", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493382449 , 0493382445", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304727476?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art History"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art History"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art History",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art History"," Comparative literature , Latin American literature , Art History"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Aesthetics , Andrade, Mario de , Arqueles Vela , Avant-garde , Brazil , Jaime Torres Bodet , Literary , Mario de Andrade , Mexico , Modernism , Novo, Salvador , Photographic , Salvador Novo , Torres Bodet, Jaime , Vela, Arqueles , Villaurrutia, Xavier , Xavier Villarrutia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+ethos+of+modernism%3A++Photographic+and+literary+aesthetics%0Ain+Mexico+and+Brazil%2C+1920%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gabara%2C+Esther+Leah&amp;isbn=9780493382449&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3676,Women's organizing in conflict zones: A case study of two Israeli women's protest movements,"This project on the politics of women's protest in Israel aims to shed light on some of the complex circumstances surrounding women's organizing in zones of conflict. The research is based on a case study and extensive fieldwork of two women's movements in Israel, the Jerusalem Link and Women for Israel's Tomorrow (Women in Green). The Jerusalem Link is a group of Israeli and Palestinian women cross-nationally organizing for peace. Women in Green, on the other hand, is a group of Jewish Israeli women in the national-religious camp in Israel that opposes the peace process and supports Jewish settlement in disputed territory. The aim of the project is to investigate the distinct structures of a zone of conflict as “sites of resistance” (Marchand &amp; Runyan, 1996), in which women contest established norms and practices, and act as potential agents of social change within conditions of armed international conflict. The focus therefore, is on the complex interplay of gendered structures and women's agency in zones of conflict. However, the women's movements under consideration represent women who have chosen to act outside the mainstream political spectrum. I argue that independence increases women's gender consciousness and awareness of their particular interests as women , as a result of the absence of constraints related to political authority and male bureaucratic decision making. In this way, women on the margins critically challenge, and potentially destabilize, conventional political boundaries, although women positioned on opposite ends of the political spectrum also contest the gendered symbols associated with representations of women in the nation. Israel is a particularly valuable case study for women's organizing because it is at once a dynamic industrialized democracy where a broad range of interests compete for power. Israeli women (Jewish) have always participated in the political process having been conscripted in the Israeli military since the establishment of statehood and given their wide range of opportunities to express political dissent. However, Israel is also a state embroiled in armed conflict. The experience of over fifty years of protracted warfare has established key gender boundaries that domesticate women during warfare and limit their opportunities for feminist activism. With a strong national security agenda, militarized, masculine norms and codes of conduct prevail over specific social groups, such as women. Women become represented as appendages of men and reproducers of the nation and its cultural continuity during times of crisis (Yuval-Davis). Therefore, while the democratic foundation of Israel encourages women to contribute to the political process (mobilization), the militarized nature of the state discourages women from challenging the patriarchal nature of that process (marginalization). This mobilization/marginalization phenomenon is the key background against which women's agency, diversity, and contestation on the margins in Israel are investigated.",304728496,,Dissertations & Theses," Jacoby, Tami AmandaJacobyAmandaTamiJacoby, Tami Amanda", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726350751 , 27189481 , 66569 , 9780612679139 , 0612679136 , NQ67913 , NQ67913", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780612679139 , 0612679136", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304728496?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Conflict zones , Israeli , Jerusalem Link , Organizing , Palestinian , Protest movements , Women for Israel's Tomorrow",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women%27s+organizing+in+conflict+zones%3A++A+case+study+of+two+Israeli+women%27s+protest+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jacoby%2C+Tami+Amanda&amp;isbn=9780612679139&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3677,On mosques and malls: An analysis of Khomeinism as a locus of resistance to the spread of global consumer culture,"This thesis explores the concepts of globalization and resistance to the globalizing process. Through a Marxist political-economic analysis, I argue that in fact globalization simply represents the logical extension of capitalism to a global scale, marked by the complementary spread of the culture/ideology of capitalism—Western consumer culture—to the entire world. Thus, it is argued, to identify genuine sites of resistance to globalization, one must look to social movements or cultural forms that challenge consumerism. In this context, I examine the 20 th century phenomenon that is widely perceived as the most prominent source of resistance to contemporary globalization—the rise of militant Islam, or, Islamic Fundamentalism. By using the Islamic Revolution in Iran as a case study, I illustrate how one can conceptualize militant Islam, in this case Khomeinism, as such a locus of resistance, by virtue of its overt anti-consumerist discourse, and the policies of the Islamic state that act to discourage consumerism indirectly. With this in mind, I conclude by extrapolating ideas observed in the functioning of the Islamic Republic, and speculating on the possibility of incorporating them into a secular Western anti-consumerist movement.",304736805,,Dissertations & Theses," Webb, Daniel JohnWebbJohnDanielWebb, Daniel John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 766155621 , 28148701 , 66569 , 9780612694439 , 0612694437 , MQ69443 , MQ69443", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780612694439 , 0612694437", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304736805?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+mosques+and+malls%3A++An+analysis+of+Khomeinism+as+a+locus+of+resistance+to+the+spread+of+global+consumer+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Webb%2C+Daniel+John&amp;isbn=9780612694439&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3678,African American musical avant -gardism,"This dissertation will demonstrate, using the work of a number of contemporary African American artists, that the nuanced and often conflicting characteristics of avant-gardism can be used in black music criticism, especially in the field of jazz, hailed as the music of modernity. This dissertation is divided into seven parts. The first part identifies the precursors out of which the avant-garde grew. This “historical” avant-garde period, 1945–1957, is seen as both contemporaneous with and departing from the bebop era. The chapter's by-line “this music is climate controlled,” is a play on the historical uses of “hot” and “cool,” terms that control the ethnic, racial, and social description of this music. The second part attempts to conceptualize a theory of African American musical avant-gardism using Renato Poggioli's classic theory in which he distinguishes four types of ideological and psychological motivation; activism, nihilism, antagonism, and agonism. Part three discusses the events and movements, especially the October Revolution in Jazz and the formation of the Jazz Composers Guild, that brought the catalysis of Black musical avant-gardism to fruition. The fourth part of the dissertation will focus on the art and experience of seven African American artists, George Russell, Yusef Lateef, Leo Smith, Bill Dixon, Marion Brown, Glenn Spearman, and William Parker through their recordings and privately published writings. Bill Dixon's work, particularly his collaboration with dancer Judith Dunn, will be considered separately in the fifth section as part of the philosophy and pedagogy of the interart inquiry into Black expressive arts. The aesthetics that characterize these and many other writers and artists and the naming of their music and their processes are not simply semantics or epistemological musings but cultural assessments by which one can know and represent an aesthetic past and, more specifically, question how disjunctures caused by musical change inform the historical moment in African American expressive forms. These artists, events and organizations are part of a larger discourse concerning jazz criticism considered in the sixth part of this dissertation. An initial circumscription, by various people and organizations that govern the jazz art world, is shown in which black artistic enterprise, experimentation and innovation were essentialized and explained away by the term avant-garde. This attempt to contain or narrowly limit the artistic range and activity of these artists has contributed over time to the excription of the African American vanguard from the construction of a jazz tradition. The final section of this work will consider how scores of African American artists have moved between two or more national spaces in order to continue to create and work since at least the mid-sixties. Between 1969 and 1981 over seventy-five record labels were established in Europe to document the new music. This creative process of transnational and transcultural dialogue between African American and European artists and other culture producers became a separate genre created in Europe under the banner of “creative improvisational music.” This dissertation will relate how American artists transmitted this new music and how it was received by European musicians using mainly Dutch musicians and producers in the Netherlands in a model of musical transculturation.

This dissertation explores the ways in which discourses of race, gender, and nation generated during World War I influenced the intellectual and pragmatic developments of the organization. Further, it examines how the desire to end war encouraged the WILPF to make alliances with prominent black clubwomen and liberal black leaders in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It also examines the formative participation of black clubwomen in the WILPF. A comparative study of the cultural and political texts (pageants, novels, poetry, syndicated newspaper columns, speeches, and travel writings) produced by leading African American (Jessie Fauset, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, and Addie Hunton) and white (Emily Greene Balch, Rachel Dubois, and Anna Melissa Graves) women internationalists, reveals their pivotal role in challenging ideologies of scientific racism and in promoting transnationalism. In particular it examines African American and white women's efforts to contest the racism of U.S. economic imperialism in places like Haiti and Liberia and in U.S. domestic policy and society. From sponsoring international investigative missions to high society teas, the WILPF highlighted the centrality of race to the shape of global, national, and local conflicts. It also explores women's local and national efforts to create and promote interracial women's peace communities. Of particular importance is the way in which WILPF Interracial Extension Committees utilized the classed discourse of noble womanhood as a bridge discourse between African American and white women. Through nationwide Interracial Extension Committees which brought people together to listen to leading New Negro artists and intellectuals, black clubwomen, and peace activists, the WILPF sought to make the women's peace movement a model for new and improved race relations. This dissertation explores both the accomplishments of the committees and the ultimate failure of the WILPF to fully integrate the participation of African American women in all aspects of the organization. Through a comparative study of the postwar beliefs and actions of African American and white women, we see how the postwar racial climate exacted similar yet different meanings upon women's lives. Compelled by the rise in domestic racism unleashed by the war and the dangers of nationalism, African American and white women forged new commitments to securing racial justice and world peace. While sharing a dedication to peace and freedom, the influence of postwar racial politics produced significant differences in the day-to-day lives and political consciousness of African American and white women. For African American women the postwar years meant fighting for basic human rights and exploring the place of Pan-African consciousness in the securement of world peace and black freedom. White women, seeing connections between the mentalities of war and the popular philosophies of scientific racism and Anglo-Saxon superiority, dedicated themselves to challenging the social hierarchies of race. Ironically, at the same time their actions and beliefs reified the centrality of white womanhood to the securement of world peace, marginalizing black women's participation.",304751219,,Dissertations & Theses," Plastas, Melinda AnnPlastasAnnMelindaPlastas, Melinda Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728110041 , 26722931 , 66569 , 9780493066554 , 0493066551 , 9997985 , 9997985", Dissertation/Thesis, 2001," 9780493066554 , 0493066551", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304751219?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0615 Political science",," 0453 Womens studies , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies , 0615 Political science"," Womens studies , Black history , American studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Peace movement , Politics , Race , Transnationalism , Women's International League for Peace and Freedom",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%98A+band+of+noble+women%E2%80%99%3A++The+WILPF+and+the+politics%0Aand+consciousness+of+race+in+the+women%27s+peace+movement%2C+1915%E2%80%931945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Plastas%2C+Melinda+Ann&amp;isbn=9780493066554&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3680,The Outine Of the Chinese Feminist Literature,"This dissertation carries multi-sided and all-rounded theoretical probation for the Chinese feminist literature in the twentieth century on its definition of the connotation, its movement of the trends of thought, its content of creative writings, its aesthetic characteristics, its value and meaning and so on, by means of combining macro-classification and micro-anatomy, viewed from the following four aspects. In the first aspect, ""discussion on the connotation"" the author gives definition fully and wholly on the connotation of ""finist literature""and concepts related to it such as ""feminism"" the consciousness of women's rights? ""female literature""and so on, and makes classification strictly and logically on mutual relationship among concepts on the foundation of investigating the actual creation results seriously, with reference to the western feminist literature and its theory. In the second, ""discussion on the trends of thought"" the author probes the development and movement of the feminist literature's trends of thought and its feature respectively under the two different historical background and social environment----the ""May 4th Movement of 1919""period and the New Age period. Of them in the former the author mainly probes the genesis, the theme and the meaning of the feminist literature during the ""May 4th Movement of 1919"" period, while in the later the author probes the main stream of the feminist literature's trends of thought during the New Age period from the following three aspects, that is: ""from the sex consciousness to the self-consciousness of discourse"" from patriarch destruction to subject construction? ""from the theory of women's rights to literary practice"" In the third, ""discussion on the creation"" the author sorts out the female writer's creation concerning women's rights of the Modern Times period and the New Age period respectively. Of them in the former the author mainly analyses the ""consciousness of subject"" the ""donsciousness of rebellion"" and the ""sexual consciousness""of the narration concerning women's rights of the Modern Times' female writer, While in the later the author sorts out the feminist poem creation during the New Age period from the following aspects: ""deconsiderating of the female's historical fate"" ""publicizing of the female's spirit of decision for herself"" ""constructing of the aesthetics of the female's sexual passion"" and sorts out the feminist novel creation from the following three aspects: ""Pointing out patriarchy's errors and offering salutary advice"" ""deconstructing of sex myth"" ""remoulding the new female"" In the fourth, ""discussion on the characteristics? the author standing on the height of aesthetics through concrete creation examples, carefully analyses the unique artistic aesthetical characteristics from the following aspects: ""Poetic writings"" ""body-rhetoric"" ""desire-narration"" As a positive construction of female poetics which is clearing up sex and rebelling from male's rights, the feminist literature reflects the distinctive feature of subversion and rebellion from the tradition not only in ideological content but also in artistic form. This unique trend gives the feminist literature unneglectable value and meaning, that is: It is unceasing pursuit toward the female's liberation, unceasing establishment of the female's subject consciousness, unceasing build-up of the female's meaning world from the layer of culture on the one hand; it is unceasing spreading of the female's individual experience, unceasing expanding of the female's aesthetical freedom, unceasing enrichment of the norm of the female's artistic form from the layer of art on the other hand. Moreover, as an important component part of the trends of thought of the global feminist culture, the Chinese feminist literature will surely strive for greater free space of existence and development with its unique ways and tenacious vitality.",1024703114, 中国女性主义文学论纲,Dissertations & Theses," Jin, Ye WenJinWenYeJin, Ye Wen金文野", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709496761 , 70366302 , 189128 , H048962 , H048962", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国女性主义文学论纲,2002,PQDT - Global,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024703114?accountid=14496, 0401 Literature, 0401 Literature, 0401 Literature,, 0401 Literature, Literature," (UMI)AAIH048962 , Language, literature and linguistics , 中国 , 二十世纪 , 女性主义文学 , 自由词",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Outine+Of+the+Chinese+Feminist+Literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jin%2C+Ye+Wen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3681,Cyberpolitics: Internet's Impact on the Political Lives and the Nation Governance in Cyber Society,"Cyberpolitics is the main research concept in this dissertation. the political phenomenon in the cyber society. It offers a critical perspective on the political phenomenon in cyberspace, the Internet's impact on political lives in the real world, and the paradigm shift of the nation states' governance. It also explores the mutual relations between the cyber society &amp; political activities, virtual politics &amp; real politics, citizens' political lives &amp; governmental governance. The theoretical model of cyberpolitics is: Cyberpolitics is composed of virtual po1itics in the cyber society, the influence of cyberspace on po1itical life, and of the realistic political reaction on the cyber society. Certainly, in the cyber society, cyberpolitics and electronic movement can also influence the society through political systems and governmental decision--making. The basic logic of this dissertation is: With the development of IT and the internet, cyberspace and cyber society have formed, the politica1 phenomenon----virtual politics. The cyber society and virtual politics inevitab1y produce significant influence on realistic political life such as state sovereignty, political systems, government management and political culture. This kind of influence is mutual. The government organization, administration management, and the exercise of power in realistic politics inevitably react on the cyber society, which produces the new governance paradigm of electronic government, knowledge management and power balance. This dissertation has the following contents: Firstly, the theoretical basis and research method. The changes from realistic po1itics to virtual politics will be the greatest historically conversion that occurs in studying politics in this generation. Virtual realistic thought is an important theory and the philosophical methodology foundation for studying cyberpolitics. The theory of the cyber society is the social foundation for the development of cyberpolitics. Combining virtuality and reality is the important method of studying cyberpolitics. Secondly, virtual politics in cyberspace. Virtuality is constituted in digita1ization. Viltuality has created a cyberspace through digitizing, which combines with network, computer, high-tech, and offers an unprecedented digital time for the human development. The politics of virtua1 reality denotes that information technology will have a significant impact on politics, which includes the forming and developing of the virtual society, virtual country, as well as cyber power. Third1y, the impact of the cyber society on political life. With the arrival of social computerization, informative process and networking, IT plays a key role in demonstrating how science and technology promote the evolution of social culture. The cyber society has the basic character of networking, informatization and digitization. It also has exerted profound influence on political lives----positive changes have already occurred in political process, political system, political power, state sovereignty, government management, and po1itical participation. Fourthly, the national management in the cyber society. The government organization, administration management, and political power in realistic politics inevitably react on cyber society. Thus, it produces the new national management paradigm, such as electronic government, knowledge management and power balance. This kind of transformation includes power shifts in cyber society, new government management structures in cyber society, such as electronic government, and new government management methods such as e1ectronic government affairs. Fifth1y, the development of cyberpolitics tendency. As mankind enters the 2l Century, the Internet is developing in a very fast speed. Despite setbacks and problems, network has become the most important platform for democratic deve1opment. Electronic government has offered very good paradigms for governance as it helps raise administrative efficiency and service levels. The development of the network economy requires the synchronous development of cyberpolitics. Moreover, political conformity and national safety are faced with many new prob1ems. Hegemony and anti-hegemony in cyber society will become the new field of international struggle. Systematic research on cyberpolitics and government governance in the cyber society is an original work in China. This dissertation has filled in the blanks of this research fie1d. I have carried out systematic and overall research for the first time for cyberpolitics, founded the theoretical pattern of cyberpolitics and put forward the viewpoint of three levels as the research object of cyberpolitics. This kind of scientific research wil1 offer theoretical guidance for network construction, especially for the benign development of electronic government. It helps to offer a new paradigm for the study of traditiona1 politics.",1024720382, 网络政治:网络对政治生活的影响及网络社会的国家治理,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Fu WenLiuWenFuLiu, Fu Wen刘文富", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709683791 , 70368312 , 189128 , H029620 , H029620", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, Chinese, Chinese, 网络政治:网络对政治生活的影响及网络社会的国家治理,2002,PQDT - Global,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024720382?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH029620 , Social sciences , 国家治理 , 政治学理论 , 网络政治 , 网络社会 , 自由词",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cyberpolitics%3A+Internet%27s+Impact+on+the+Political+Lives+and+the+Nation+Governance+in+Cyber+Society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Fu+Wen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3682,On collective agreement legal system: a perspective study on the general principle of collective agreement and its trend in China,"The purpose of this dissertation is to clarify the misunderstanding on collective agreement, to probe the theory on collective agreement , and to discuss the trend of collective agreement by a perspective study. The methods of comparison, history and class analysis are adopted for the study on the subject to illustrate that the collective agreement plays the most essential and important role in adjusting the labour relation. After the China's entry of WTO, collective agreement will hold the leading position for the employees to protect their rights. Compared with several definitions of collective agreement, collective agreement can be defined as an agreement in written reached between the trade union or the representative of employees and the employer or employers union concerning employment and labour condition , the collective bargain and enterprise management. This definition revises and develops the definition of collective agreement stipulated in the Chinese present regulation and the international labour standard. In attempting to make a clear distinction between the collective agreement and the civil contract, the author makes a study on the relation between the labour law and the civil law，economic law. The collective agreement should not be treated as one of civil contracts and does not apply to the contract law. Labour law is the proper law of collective agreement. After the perspective study on the distinction between the collective agreement and the labour contract, the author does not regard the labour contract as an essential tool for the settlement on labour problem, but the collective agreement as a basic and widely applicable labour system embodied the labour law spirit. The state should make the law for the collective agreement as soon as possible. The general principle behind the collective agreement is discussed in this dissertation. Profit-Interest-Sharing theory(PIS) is proposed after the study and comment on the theories in the past. PIS should be applied in the total process of the collective agreement as the basic theory of collective agreement and is one of the basic rules of collective agreement including the signification, performance and termination. The author criticizes the traditional corporate profit-sharing system, management system, decision-making system which neglect the employees` interest. The employees should participate in the director board, supervisor board or the process of decision-making by the collective agreement with the help of the trade union. Collective Agreement cannot be separate from the collective bargaining and the dispute settlement .The dissertation emphases on the process of collective bargaining and proposes that the law should regulate the process of collective bargaining and the industrial action, such as strike, slowdown and lockouts caused by the failure of bargaining in order to reduce the social disorder. Collective agreement dispute settlement occurred between the two unions will be more rational than the labour contract dispute settlement between the individual employee and the employer. The trade union should be engaged in the dispute settlement between the individual employee and the employer by the collective agreement. It is a great help to solve the problem of the labour disputes rising in a large-scale. The development of collective agreement in china is affected by two elements: one is the economic elements of Chinese firms, another is globalization. The relation between WTO and labour problem is discussed to illustrate the trade and employment. The author demonstrates that we should concern about the anti-WTO movement and the social clause by America in thought of Chinese national interest protection. The initiation and development of collective agreement should be the first task for china after the entry of WTO.",1027896594, 论集体合同法律制度——集体合同法一般理论及在中国发展趋势研究,Dissertations & Theses," Jiang, Lu JunJiangJunLuJiang, Lu Jun姜俊禄", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721112571 , 70366292 , 189128 , H013560 , H013560", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, Chinese, Chinese, 论集体合同法律制度——集体合同法一般理论及在中国发展趋势研究,2002,PQDT - Global,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027896594?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIH013560 , Social sciences , 利益共享 , 自由词 , 集体争议 , 集体合同 , 集体谈判",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+collective+agreement+legal+system%3A+a+perspective+study+on+the+general+principle+of+collective+agreement+and+its+trend+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jiang%2C+Lu+Jun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3683,He Comparison study of sino-foreign company,"After studying the contents with “SX4-10 Law” concerning the oiland gas (O&amp;G) cost of the international oil company, the articlehas systematically analyzed and compared the Sinopec and foreignoil company’s O&amp;G cost’s differences, such as its classificationsstructures ,and cost accounting etc .By analyzing the international oil company’s common O&amp;G cost’s movement tendencyand rule which has been outlined and showing in the recent 10years, that is between 1991 and 2000, the article has comparedand studied the differences in O&amp;G costs between the Sinopec andforeign oil company, furthermore, it has taken impersonally partthe real and internal reasons in details which has resulted in thedifferences at home and abroad.

Its one party government, nevertheless, remains intact and subsequently the voices of individual Cubans are rarely heard above the state's ideological rhetoric in the face of ongoing political and economic aggression from the U. S. Based on nine months ethnographic field work in Cuba, this thesis investigates the lived experiences of transformation in Cuba today and maps some of the heterogeneity that lies behind Castro's projection of a homogenous and united nation. It does so through considering young people's interactions with the Afro-Cuban religion Santeria and Cuba's burgeoning Pentecostal movement. As a dynamic site of cultural and social change that intersects with both revolutionary expectation as well as recent inflows of global capital and youth culture the changing spaces and meanings of religious practice uncovered through this research, reveals new allegiances, identities and subjectivities of young people in Cuba today.

This period in the history of the Societies has received relatively little scholarly attention. On the one hand, historians of anti-slavery have focussed overwhelmingly on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. On the other, scholars of modern human rights have concentrated their attention on the period following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This thesis aims not only to bridge this gap, but to bring thesis literatures — on anti-slavery and human rights — into productive dialogue. The thesis has three major themes. Firstly, it situates the two Societies within a wider 'humanitarian complex' that includes pan-Africanists, missionaries, feminists, social reformers and others, exploring the connections and the tensions between these groups. Secondly, it considers the imaginative geography of British humanitarian concern during the period under study, which involves both a global mapping of the humanitarian gaze and the discussion of the politics of representation. Thirdly, it examines the repertoire of practices which humanitarians developed in their campaigns to bring slavery and other humanitarian abuses to the attention of various different publics. The thesis is organised into seven chapters. Chapter 1 establishes the theoretical framework for the study, drawing especially on the work of Catherine Hall. Chapter 2 provides an historical context for British humanitarianism between 1884 and 1933. Chapter 3 considers the humanitarian complex. Chapter 4 examines the role of the journals published by the two Societies in bringing humanitarian issues to the fore. Chapter 5 investigates the models of empire imagined by British humanitarians. Chapter 6 provides an account of the celebrations organised by the humanitarian movement in 1933 to mark the centenary of the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. The thesis concludes by exploring the relationship between British humanitarianism in this period and its modern equivalent.",1797883691,,Dissertations & Theses," Mitcham, Roderick EllisMitchamEllisRoderickMitcham, Roderick Ellis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4094253131 , 102902202 , 101309 , U171657 , U171657", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1797883691?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," DXN069287 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+geographies+of+global+humanitarianism%3A+the+anti-slavery+society+and+aborigines+protection+society%2C+1884-1933&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mitcham%2C+Roderick+Ellis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3686,Norberto Bobbio's politics of culture: A formula for liberalism and an antidote to fascism,"Bobbie's prose emphasizes the polemical duality of the palazzo and the piazza - the uneasy relationship between those who govern and those who are governed, and their perennial yet necessary rivalry in a mature democracy. Although no overreaching moral theory can resolve all of the ethical tensions that exist today, Bobbio chooses to prioritize the prevention of the abuse of power at the individual and group level in developing his own form of democratic liberalism. Bobbio's message is that Fascism and anti-Fascism must not merely pass into history. In this thesis, I set out to prove the validity of Bobbio's tenet that political and social democracy cannot be satisfied through the exclusive pursuit of economic democracy. Democracy, he claims, can only be realized through the implementation of democratic institutions that guarantee international participation. I aim to define the politics of culture that Bobbio prescribes to preserve the role of culture, and to show that anti-Fascism is necessary to liberalism. Anti-Fascism permits individuals to articulate their needs and ideals in society, unlike Fascism which stifles these through its monoculture. I also explain the applicability of anti-Fascism as a contemporary political method, and I reinforce the idea that democratic values are strengthened through the addition of an anti-Fascist component. I illustrate how the history of anti-Fascism and the intellectuals who are committed to preserving its memory and political utility need no longer form part of a side-lined ""grey zone"". On the contrary, they indicate a path to contemporary democratic theory. I argue that the ideals of the Partito d'Azione, although formulated in the late 1930s and early 1940s, have significant relevance to the questions of the current epoch. The Partito d'Azione gave rise to a popular vocation for liberty that has today become the target of the neo-liberal Right. The political programme of that Right is based on the dismantling of the anti-Fascist corpus of ideas - including the validity of debate and of non-conformist views - as developed by the members of the anti- Fascist intellectual community of Turin. The neo-liberal Right seeks to transform Italy into a market with US-style flexibility and to discredit the entire baggage of Italy's post-war Left. With Communism out of the picture in terms of political relevance, all that remains of the Left in Italy is Bobbio's social liberalism. Bobbio's political agenda was never limited to the prerogatives of labour but sprang to the defence of the under-dog, that is, those whose citizenship puts them at risk, or whose basic rights at the international level are threatened. My thesis provides a historical context through which Bobbio's work can be approached, through an examination of his role as a protagonist of the anti- Fascist movement.

General opinion among archaeologists has been that pastoral material culture is of an expedient and ephemeral nature and hence difficult to detect archaeologically. This thesis, however, argues that the neglect of ancient pastoralism in archaeology is partially the result of a deficient understanding of this way of life in material and social terms. This thesis is an ethnoarchaeological study of pastoral material culture in mountain and lowland regions on the island of Sardinia (Italy), which were related by transhumant patterns of movement of shepherds with their flocks of sheep. The archaeological material presented dates from the nineteenth and twentieth century, and is analysed according to a landscape approach. Continuity and change in patterns of pastoral practices in the countryside are determined by a combination of ecological and historical factors. The analysis focuses on the mutual interaction of socio-economic and political developments at local, national and international levels to account for the transformations visible in the rural landscapes studied. The ways in which historical, ethnographic and archaeological data inform each other are discussed. It is argued that a combination of an approach predicated upon the Marxist concept of multiple modes of production and the notion of peasantries offers the best theoretical framework to create an understanding of the material characteristics of the rural landscapes studied. Central themes are the interplay of markets for pastoral products, and government policies towards different systems of access to and property of land.",1817351962,,Dissertations & Theses," Mientjes, Antoon CornelisMientjesCornelisAntoonMientjes, Antoon Cornelis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4172784971 , 107616172 , 101309 , U152699 , U152699", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1817351962?accountid=14496, 0324 Archaeology, 0324 Archaeology, 0324 Archaeology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0324 Archaeology, Archaeology," (UMI)AAIU152699 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pastoralism+in+sardinia%3A+ethnoarchaeological+research+into+the+material+and+spatial+features+of+pastoralism+in+a+regional+context&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mientjes%2C+Antoon+Cornelis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3688,"Profeminist men in the American Progressive era in the autobiographies of Margaret Sanger, Jane Addams, and Edith Wharton","Historically, the collective participation of men in the American women's movement has been met with criticism, if not condemnation, from the feminist majority. Despite feminist opposition, profeminist men, a contingent of the patriarchy, have worked individually to support women's causes. During the American Progressive era, the autobiographies of birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, social reformer Jane Addams, and novelist Edith Wharton reveal that the early influence of profeminist patriarchs in the private sphere prefigured their collaboration with profeminist mentors in the public sphere. These men contributed to the success of Sanger, Addams, and Wharton by providing intellectual and literary mentorship, organizational and financial resources, and domestic and emotional support. The autobiographies of these Progressive feminist writers illuminate a more global and striking reality: that profeminist men play a significant supporting role alongside the matriarchy and the sisterhood in collaborating with feminist women to construct a more egalitarian culture.",230758831,,Dissertations & Theses," Lednicky, Julia NelsonLednickyNelsonJuliaLednicky, Julia Nelson", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727232671 , 28625851 , 66569 , 9780493640822 , 0493640827 , 1409092 , 1409092", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493640822 , 0493640827", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/230758831?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Profeminist+men+in+the+American+Progressive+era+in+the+autobiographies+of+Margaret+Sanger%2C+Jane+Addams%2C+and+Edith+Wharton&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lednicky%2C+Julia+Nelson&amp;isbn=9780493640822&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3689,Pre-occupied spaces: Re-configuring the Italian nation through its migrations,"Centered on the culture produced by 20 th -century Italian migrations, my dissertation is a comparative analysis of several works created in various parts of the world in equally numerous languages and techniques. In particular, it calls for a reading of Italian outbound and inbound flows of migration as foundational phenomena in the understanding of Italy's complex formation as a nation. This project focuses on the cultural production of/on migrants that articulate forms and ideas of space as derived from the migration experience. In fact, the novelty of this dissertation rests not only on its bridging operation of emigration and immigration cultures, but also on its interpretative method based on theories of space. Private as well as public sites in the texts are seen as concrete and metaphorical loci in which groups and individuals always enter historically pre-occupied spaces thus producing and being affected by forms of social preoccupation. As such, the spaces under consideration host politics of resistance from specific ethnic and gender positions. Interdisciplinary in nature, the work embraces fiction (Melliti's and Di Donato's novels), short prose (stories by Calvino, Sciascia, Maraini, Camilleri), non-fiction (memoirs by Albuquerque and Stephenson), architecture (environmental art sites in Southern California and Sicily), film (Amelio's Lamerica ), philosophy (de Certeau), sociology (Dal Lago), and urban geography (Soja, Hayden, Harvey), precisely in the attempt to propose a new pluri-vocal approach to migration issues. This revaluation of the relevance of the humanities in the field of Migration Studies invests both the “canon” and the “margin” in order to complicate this binarism and create a dialogue among migrant and non-migrant authors in the US as well as in Italy. Starting from the premise that nations can only be comprehended as part of global networks of relations and movements, the project proposes a recuperation of past histories of migration to produce a cultural and civic awareness considering migrants as resources rather than unwanted presences in the formation of societies characterized by old and new forms of diversity. The dissertation, aimed at offering tools, ideas, and sources in the pedagogical and political arenas at once, falls under many rubrics, ranging from Comparative Literature to Ethnic and Italian Cultural Studies.",275656940,,Dissertations & Theses," Fiore, TeresaFioreTeresaFiore, Teresa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764852401 , 29208391 , 66569 , 9780493832739 , 0493832734 , 3064464 , 3064464", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493832739 , 0493832734", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275656940?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0377 Art History"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0377 Art History"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0377 Art History",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Motion Pictures , 0377 Art History"," Comparative literature , Romance literature , American literature , Cultural anthropology , Motion Pictures , Art History"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Diaspora , Italian , Migrations , Nation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pre-occupied+spaces%3A++Re-configuring+the+Italian+nation+through+its+migrations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fiore%2C+Teresa&amp;isbn=9780493832739&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3690,"National identity, religion and democracy in Poland since 1989","The objective of this study is to analyze the reshaping of national identity in post communist Poland and the contribution of both religious and non-religious sectors of opinion in this context. Religious nationalism, as a political movement acted to unify the resistance against foreign oppression during the communist period. Now that individual interests can be expressed through alternative institutions and religious nationalism is no longer directed against the state, the Church is pressured to take a more peripheral role in politics. Nevertheless, religion remains a salient feature of national identity and continues to mobilize debate in the political arena. The main question to be addressed is how crucial opinion leaders reconfigure Polish national identity and nationalism as a form of political mobilization to fit the new domestic and global environment in the post communist period. One hundred and thirty face-to-face interviews were conducted with intellectuals, parish priests and political leaders. A typology of elite strategies is presented. The typology along with the responses of these opinion leaders add clarity to our understanding of attitudes toward democracy and political diversity in a religious nation as well as give an appreciation for how elites meet the challenge of establishing national identity in a period of rapid social, political and economic change.",275819361,,Dissertations & Theses," Kaftan, Joanna UrszulaKaftanUrszulaJoannaKaftan, Joanna Urszula", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726363201 , 28379201 , 66569 , 9780493537955 , 0493537953 , 3040578 , 3040578", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493537955 , 0493537953", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275819361?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history",," 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science , 0335 European history"," Sociology , Political science , European history"," Social sciences , Democracy , National identity , Poland , Religion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=National+identity%2C+religion+and+democracy+in+Poland+since+1989&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kaftan%2C+Joanna+Urszula&amp;isbn=9780493537955&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3691,"Federal child labor policies in America, 1912 to 2002: A historical materialist view","This study examined the relationship between the development of federal child labor policy and the developments within the U.S. economy from 1912 to 2012 from an historical materialist perspective. This was an exploratory, descriptive, historical, policy analysis that employed the theoretical framework of historical materialism to provide insights into the ways that economic forces impact on the development of child labor policy. The texts for analysis included books, articles and congressional records on the nature, subject and development of child labor law. This study sought to answer the following two research questions: (1) What are the federal child labor policies enacted during the industrial age (1912–1952), the expansion of the service sector (1952–1972) and the globalization in the electronic age (1972–2002)? (2) What is the relationship between the changes in the economy (i.e., technology, changing productive forces and capital's need for various kinds of labor) and enactment of federal policies that affect the conditions of child labor in the manufacturing, service and agricultural industries (where applicable) during the industrial age, the expansion of the service sector and globalization in the electronic age? The findings suggested that over the period of 1912 to 2002, a total of sixteen laws, with child labor provisions, were introduced into the Congress. Of the sixteen laws, one was never passed and two were repealed. The analysis indicates that legislation designed to protect children were actual provisions in laws designed to address a labor force in crisis. The child labor provisions that were enacted throughout the twentieth century resulted from the larger struggle between labor and capital. At points of intense pressure, capitalists were forced to concede to a labor force which was demanding work, standard working conditions and basic minimum wages. Despite this pressure, there is no comprehensive child labor law banning the use of children sixteen and below in the work force. The moral appeal from the social reform movements against child labor had less impact on the establishment of child labor laws in comparison to the increasing conflict between labor and capital. Legal restrictions against child labor were primarily applied to the manufacturing and service industries in an effort to bring adults back into the workforce. Yet, the absence of stronger provisions in the agricultural sector for children from general labor policy indicated the contradiction of efforts by the Congress to protect its children in a sector where lower skilled level was readily used. The significance of these findings lies in the contradictions of American values towards the well being of its most vulnerable population. Recommendations for future research include further research on policy and the analysis of the very root causes of child labor that stem from the economic system of global capitalism.",276312027,,Dissertations & Theses," Rodriguez, Anthonette AndreaRodriguezAndreaAnthonetteRodriguez, Anthonette Andrea", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764935591 , 29201561 , 66569 , 9780493858142 , 0493858148 , 3066527 , 3066527", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493858142 , 0493858148", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/276312027?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history"," 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history"," 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history",," 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history"," Labor relations , American history"," Social sciences , Child labor , Federal policies , Historical materialist",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Federal+child+labor+policies+in+America%2C+1912+to+2002%3A++A+historical+materialist+view&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rodriguez%2C+Anthonette+Andrea&amp;isbn=9780493858142&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3692,To build up a pure land in the world: a study of the formation of the tz'u chi buddhist group in taiwan,"This study is a case study of Tz'u Chi, a Buddhist group which has been expanding rapidly in recent years.  Although chanting sutras and the Buddha's name are the main practices in the Buddhist tradition in Taiwan, the founder, Master Cheng Yen starts her mission by asking her followers to perform charity work.  Its stated objectives are:  charity, medical provision, education, culture, bone-marrow donation, and international relief.  Its way of practice seems to be meeting the religious needs of a large proportion of the people of Taiwan.  I argue that the formation of Tz'u Chi is a symbolic process of construction that entails a dynamic interaction between members and the religious group in which both individual and group identity are produced and reproduced.  I also argue that Cheng Yen's charisma is essentially born out in different stages of Cheng Yen's life. The following themes will be examined in the study.  How did the religious tradition survive the advent of the reinterpretation of the religious doctrine?  How was Cheng Yen's charismatic recognition generated?  How was the transition from that of a poor women to an extraordinary religious leader of supernatural power effected both in terms of the emergence of a charismatic self-identity, and of its successful negotiation with others?  What was the appeal of Cheng Yen and why did her followers remain faithful to her teachings, with the result that;  in time, a new religious movement was created? This study suggests that Tz'u Chi members use their master's appeal - ""To build up the pure land in the world"" and teaching-""to be a Bodhisattva""- as symbolic ground for collective and individual identities.  These symbols are an essential property of the successful integration of lay Buddhist subjects and the Buddhist group itself.  While Tz'u Chi is a constructed Buddhist group, its formation should not be seen as an exclusively Taiwanese phenomenon, but one that is of great importance for scholars of Buddhist studies in general.  Thus I affirm that the formation of Tz'u Chi in the context of a society experiencing rapid social change is a significant event in the study of Chinese Buddhism in Taiwan.",301556075,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, RongzhangWangRongzhangWang, Rongzhang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760077451 , 44983861 , 101309 , U182175 , U182175", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301556075?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0318 Religion, Religion," DXN075624 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=To+build+up+a+pure+land+in+the+world%3A+a+study+of+the+formation+of+the+tz%27u+chi+buddhist+group+in+taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Rongzhang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3693,Spaces of appearance: writings on contemporary theatre and performance,"This thesis, a collection of previously published materials, reflects a plural and evolving engagement with theatre and performance over the past fifteen years or so: as researcher, writer, editor, teacher, practitioner, spectator. These have rarely been discreet categories for me, but rather different modalities of exploration and enquiry, interrelated spaces encouraging dynamic connectivities, flows and further questions. Section 1 offers critical accounts of the practices of four contemporary theatre directors: Jerzy Grotowski, Robert Wilson, Peter Brook and Ariane Mnouchkine. Section 2 draws on elements of contemporary philosophy and critical thinking to explore the mutable parameters of performance. lt proposes performative mappings of certain unpredictable, energetic events 'in proximity of performance', to borrow Matthew Goulish's phrase: contact, fire, animals, alterity, place. Section 3 contains examples of documentation of performance practices, including a thick description of a mise en scene of a major international theatre production, reflections on process, training and dramaturgy, a performance text with a framing dramaturgical statement, and personal perspectives on particular collaborations. The external Appendix comprises a recently published collection of edited and translated materials concerning five core collaborative projects realised by Ariane Mnouchkine and the Theatre du Soleil at their base in the Cartoucherie de Vincennes, Paris. The core concerns of this thesis include attempts to think through: • the working regimes, poetics and pedagogies of certain directors, usually in collaborative devising contexts within which the creative agency of performers is privileged; • the processes and micro-politics of collaboration, devising, and dramaturgical composition; the dramaturgical implications of trainings, narrative structures, spaces, mise en scene, and of images as multi-layered, dynamic 'fields'; • the predicament and agency of spectators in diverse performance contexts, and the ways in which spectatorial roles are posited or constructed by dramaturgies; • the imbrication of embodiment, movement and perception in performance, and the plurality of modes of perception; • the critical and political functions of theatre and theatre criticism as cultural/social practice and 'art of memory' (de Certeau), of dramaturgies as critical historiographies, and of theatre cultures (and identities) as plural, dynamic, and contested; • performance as concentrated space for inter-subjectivity and the flaring into appearance of the 'face-to-face' (Levinas); the possibility of ethical, 'response-able' encounter and exchange with another; identity as relational and in-process, alterity as productive event, the inter-personal as political; • the poetics and politics of what seems an unthinkable surplus (and constitutive 'outside') to the cognitive reach of many conventional frames and maps in theatre criticism and historiography; an exploration of acts of writing as performative propositions and provocations ('critical fictions') to think the event of meanings at/of the limits of knowledge and subjectivity. This partial listing of recurrent and evolving concerns within the thesis traces a trajectory in my evolution as a writer and thinker, a gradual displacement from the relatively 'solid ground' of theatre studies and theatre history towards more fluid and tentative articulations of the shifting 'lie of the land' in contemporary performance and philosophy. This trajectory reflects a growing fascination with present process, conditions, practices, perceptions 'in the middle', and ways of writing (about) performance as interactive and ephemeral event.",301563041,,Dissertations & Theses," Williams, Antony David C.WilliamsDavid C.AntonyWilliams, Antony David C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759166831 , 44891671 , 101309 , U148066 , U148066 , http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/2216", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301563041?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/2216 , (UMI)AAIU148066 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spaces+of+appearance%3A+writings+on+contemporary+theatre+and+performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Antony+David+C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3694,International boundaries and economic integration:  freight transportation and labour disputes on the Venezuelan-Colombian border. (BL: DXN067401),"The world political map is changing as result of two processes:  first, the collapse of the Soviet Union; and second, the impacts of globalisation.  Both aspects have affected the territorial nature of the state and the functions of international boundaries.  Boundary functions are also transforming with the emergence of regional economic blocs.  The traditional role of the border is becoming more complex, although territorial differences and conflicts across state boundaries remain serious problems. The process of economic integration in the Andean Community (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru) represents an intriguing example.  Venezuela and Colombia have benefited from increasing commercial exchange.  However, problems in the provision of freight services across the border are confronting national governments and local groups with a series of political and institutional dilemmas. The aim of this study was to examine the dispute of Venezuelan truckers and business operators at the Colombian border in the light of current debates about economic globalisation. The theoretical approach of this study was based on the political economy and political geography perspectives about contemporary globalisation, its consequences and challenges.  Traditional services and practices at the border, the role of the participants in the border dispute, and the results of two major road blockages have been evaluated.  Two sets of qualitative procedures were used as methods of analysis:  newspaper records were used to investigate the dispute, and interviews were conducted with the principal actors involved. The thesis argues that the increase in international freight services across the border has raised new problems and conflicts.  Venezuelan truckers and operators have perceived themselves to the excluded.  They have demanded participation in the integration process.  Despite geographical asymmetries on either side of the border, the border region has traditionally been a place of peaceful co-existence.  However, with the increase of transboundary flows, the border region is becoming more contested, while new labour movements and social identities are emerging on either side.",301573914,,Dissertations & Theses," Gomez, R.L.GomezR.L.Gomez, R.L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759999081 , 44928401 , 101309 , U172134 , U172134", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301573914?accountid=14496, 0505 Economics, 0505 Economics, 0505 Economics,, 0505 Economics, Economics," DXN067401 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=International+boundaries+and+economic+integration%3A%C2%A0+freight+transportation+and+labour+disputes+on+the+Venezuelan-Colombian+border.+%28BL%3A+DXN067401%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gomez%2C+R.L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3695,An assessment of city marketing strategies and urban entrepreneurialism in uk local authorities,"This thesis argues that geographers have over-generalised about the nature and growth of city marketing strategies, whilst simultaneously ignoring geographically diverse policy outcomes from within the local state. There is a tendency to link city marketing almost exclusively to entrepreneurial growth strategies. It is mainly seen as a policy concerned with positioning localities to an international business or tourist audience. Consequently the growth of city marketing is seen as indicative of local restructuring processes, which are said to have transformed the local state, for example, it is argued that the local state is abandoning its commitment to indigenous social welfare needs. Broadly this transition is referred to as the shift from managerialism to urban entrepreneurialism. This thesis, however, criticises theory, because assumptions about city marketing and the local state are too often based on limited empirical evidence and a deep misunderstanding of what is meant by the concept of marketing. As a result city marketing remains a poorly defined activity. This thesis argues, therefore, that geographers need to understand more incisively how city marketing is understood and practised on the ground and to identify factors that account for spatial diversity of local policy outcomes. The first stage of the research, a national postal survey of local authorities, identified widespread recognition of the importance of marketing as a tool of LED, but at the same time revealed a significant movement away from external promotion and that the scale of marketing activity is often quite limited. The second stage of the research, based on qualitative interviews with practitioners in five case study areas revealed that the marketing and entrepreneurial mind-set of practitioners is varied and complex.",301594777,,Dissertations & Theses," Millington, Steven DavidMillingtonDavidStevenMillington, Steven David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759165661 , 44890931 , 101309 , U148656 , U148656 , http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/615976/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301594777?accountid=14496, 0617 Public administration, 0617 Public administration, 0617 Public administration, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0617 Public administration, Public administration," http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/615976/ , (UMI)AAIU148656 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+assessment+of+city+marketing+strategies+and+urban+entrepreneurialism+in+uk+local+authorities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Millington%2C+Steven+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3696,"Traces of empire, seeds of desire: Africa and Women in the novels of Naomi Mitchison. (BL: DXN053733)","Naomi Mitchison (1897-1999) used a plain style to tell resonant stories and unfold complex ideas in genres as diverse as historical novels and science fiction. Two fascinating biographies of Mitchison and several cogent articles on her fiction have been published, but no collections or monographs on her writing. My study examines how feminism and imperialism intersect in her novels. Reading these novels has stimulated an approach related to two 'dark continents' conceptualised at the beginning of the twentieth century: Africa (within a European perspective) and (the desires of adult, European) women. Tropes and discourses of gender, empire and class are ultimately inseparable one from another, but for the sake of clarity I focus my first three chapters to a greater extent on a shifting imagination of Africa in Mitchison's fiction and the last three chapters on ideas about women. The first part of this work examines a movement from the visionary feminist historical novel The Corn King and the Spring Queen (1931), in which Africa surfaces as an object trace in slaves who goggle and roll their eyes, to When We Become Men (1965), narrated from the points of view of Batswana and Black South African characters, in which a specific African country, Bechuanaland, is written as an historical part of the world. The study consists of a series of essays, each with its own argument, rather than developing a single proposition. The second part investigates departures from social and sexual norms in Mitchson's novels as her female characters travel independently and demonstrate sexual desire which is not confined to heterosexual response, or as the subject of her fiction alters from an imagined human protagonist to a global movement to feed the world. Mitchison's novels are interpreted with reference to theorists with whom she herself was familiar, such as Freud and Marx, and to more recent criticism and theory, particularly postcolonial and feminist approaches.",301596501,,Dissertations & Theses," Shaw, S.ShawS.Shaw, S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759164921 , 44842611 , 101309 , U152614 , U152614", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301596501?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," BL: DXN053733 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Traces+of+empire%2C+seeds+of+desire%3A++Africa+and+Women+in+the+novels+of+Naomi+Mitchison.+%28BL%3A+DXN053733%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shaw%2C+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3697,The political economy of civilization: Peasant-workers in Zimbabwe and the neo-colonial world,"This thesis provides a global political economy of the postwar period, with special reference to Zimbabwe. The conceptual aim is to connect the agrarian question with contemporary democratic theory, by inquiring into the global sources of 'civil society' and relating it to the phenomenon of semi-proletarianisation. There are three basic arguments. First, civil society cannot be understood in isolation from imperialism. The onset of the Cold War produced an ultra-imperial order under US leadership, with a 'global development' project crafted to its needs and a mode of rule preoccupied with the definition and enforcement of 'civil society'. Second, capital accumulation in the postwar period has continued to operate in accordance with the laws of motion of the centre-periphery relationship; the main alteration has consisted in the closer integration of central-state economies with each other, along with a small number of industrial satellites. The periphery has remained in a disarticulated pattern of accumulation, whose corollary is the reproduction of semi-proletarianisation on a grand scale. Third, under ultra-imperialism, 'civil society' has been defined in accordance with the requirements of disarticulated accumulation, while semi-proletarian politics have all too often been relegated to the 'uncivil' domain. The thesis focuses on the relationship between the civil and uncivil politics of the semi-proletariat. During 'nation-building', which dovetailed with the Cold War, uncivil politics comprised of 'property unfriendly' forces, the radical nationalist and socialist seeking to nationalise industry and redistribute land (i.e., to alter the pattern of accumulation). With the onset of 'structural adjustment' and the end of the Cold War, the uncivil net was cast wider to the 'market unfriendly', including radical trade unionisms and land occupation movements. It is argued that in the postwar period uncivil politics have occasionally obtained social revolution; or extensive agrarian reforms and capitalist development; or, most commonly, limited agrarian reforms within a persisting pattern of disarticulated accumulation (Zimbabwe being the case in point). The latter outcome owes to the systematic 'civilisation' of oppositional politics by means of cooptation tactics - not least within international trade unionism - and outright repression. The thesis demonstrates these arguments with a detailed account of Zimbabwe's experience, and concludes with reflections on the prospects of a post-liberal civilisation.",301602423,,Dissertations & Theses," Yeros, ParisYerosParisYeros, Paris", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760096201 , 44908681 , 101309 , U172056 , U172056", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301602423?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," DXN069290 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+economy+of+civilization%3A+Peasant-workers+in+Zimbabwe+and+the+neo-colonial+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yeros%2C+Paris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3698,On relocating contemporary chinese art,"Contemporary art from China has developed in the 1980s and 1990s as a considerable cultural force in the Chinese and international art world. A large number of artists moved out of China during the 1980s to work internationally, forming what might be termed a Chinese art diaspora.  This thesis presents a critique of the framework in which contemporary art from the People's Republic of China is discussed. It takes the theme of 'relocation' to demonstrate the geographical, conceptual and formal relocation that much contemporary art from China signifies.  Although this relocation is historically and culturally rooted in 1980s' China, much of the work produced has been transformed by the negotiation which takes place when artists act as cultural agents between differing political, historical and cultural terms of reference. Chapter one aims to lay out the theoretical terrain of the thesis, advocating a multi-disciplinary approach which intervenes in the interstices of Art History and Sinology. The following three chapters demonstrate the need for such an approach through the material they present and critique. In chapter one Chinese contemporary art is seen as a new 'subject' which is self-defining but undermined by the narratives which historicise it. Chapter two examines the Xiamen Dada movement led by Huang Yongping as a radical critique of art in China during the 1980s and his later move into the international art world as postcolonial cultural critic who reinscribes China into the biased structures of 'Western' culture. Chapter three examines representations of Chinese contemporary art in the UK with reference to Orientalism.

The last section presents two applications of the concepts of money and risk. In the first exercise we utilize an Arrow-Debreu type of model and in a general equilibrium framework with no risk we derive and prove the conditions under which the price of money will be positive. The second exercise introduces the facility of credit and its by-product of risk and bankruptcy. To add realism into our study, we construct an optimal bankruptcy law when government exemptions and social stigma are included in its construction. The objective of the second essay is very specific. We attempt to answer the question of whether the gain and loss in property market speculations and rates of information flow play a significant role in stock market volatility in Hong Kong. Two different measures of volatility: Absolute (absolute value of standard deviation from mean with monthly dimension) and conditional (EGARCH) are used and results are compared. In both measures we find evidence of a positive wealth effect on stock market volatility, in particular in the investment of upper luxury class of property in Hong Kong. In the final essay we test empirically the reaction of four international stock markets to the changes in U.S. interest rates, which frequently serve as signal of its economic condition. To achieve our aim this paper attempts to quantify the relationship between the spot yield spread of the U.S. bond market and volatility of the stock market for the period of February 1979 to December 1998. The four major international stock markets, namely Hong Kong, Japan, U.K. and the U.S., are chosen for examination. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to expand the study of yield spread into three-dimensions in terms of multi-maturity spectrum, multi-horizon, and multi-country. Another distinctive feature of this paper is that in order to ensure our model captures all the dynamics, a Common Factor (COMFAC) approach is used for model selection.

In fact, Isan writers have played a role, often a prominent one, in every stage of the development of Thai literature in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Dark Age of Philbul and Sarit in the 1950's and early 1960's, the Era of Search of the 1960's and early 1970's, the Literature of Life movement in the 1970's and early 1980's, and the subsequent rise of literary regionalism in the 1980's and 1990's. One manifestation of regionalist sentiment is the Isan Writers' Association, which now claims hundreds of members, produces a bimonthly newsletter, and organizes frequent activities in Isan to promote the production and appreciation of literature. Several Isan writers, including Lao Khamhawm, Khamphun Bunthawi, Khamman Khonkhai, and Phaiwarin Khaongam, have gained national and even international reputations for their work, much of which expresses their individual Isan sensibilities. Other writers, such as Kanchana Nakkhanan and Prachakhom Lunachai, tend to downplay their Isan origins. Surachai Janthimathorn, Prasert Jandam, and Somkhit Singsong have become icons of the leftist political and artistic movement of the 1970's and their work draws heavily on Isan for its inspiration. More recently, a great diversity of style and viewpoint has been expressed by writers like Fon Fafang, Pramote Naijit, Manote Phromsingh, Phisit Phusri, and Chatchawal Khotsongkhram in the form of satire and social criticism, psychological drama, contemporary interpretations of folk tales, and expressions of ethnic pride and diversity.",301626138,,Dissertations & Theses," Platt, Martin BrewsterPlattBrewsterMartinPlatt, Martin Brewster", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759899701 , 44904361 , 101309 , U158750 , U158750", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301626138?accountid=14496, 0401 Literature, 0401 Literature, 0401 Literature, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0401 Literature, Literature," DXN059212 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Regionalism+and+modern+thai+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Platt%2C+Martin+Brewster&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3701,John Howard Yoder's conception of the ecclesial practice of &lt;i&gt;binding and loosing&lt;/i&gt; as applied to the Victim Offender Reconciliation Program,"John Howard Yoder (1927–1997) was an outspoken voice for translating Mennonite and believers' church theology to the ecumenical community and the rest of the society. Yoder's writings spanned theology, ethics, church history, philosophy, and political theory. His doctoral work was completed at the University of Basel, where he also studied with Karl Barth. Yoder was attracted to Barth's claim that the civil community and the church community could no longer be considered contiguous, but by “analogy” the two could communicate with each other. Yoder adapted and expanded on the concept of analogy by exploring how the practices of the church could serve as paradigms for the larger society. In Yoder's small book, Body Politics: Five Practices of the Christian Community Before the Watching World , he outlined five of those practices and began to offer suggestions for how they might be translated. He contended that one of the practices, binding and loosing , could be translated into areas such as criminal justice, international relations, and ecumenical and interfaith dialogue. Yoder offered one example of a successful translation of the practice, the Victim Offender Reconciliation Program (VORP). The thesis of this dissertation is that churchly practices can be translated to the wider world by following Yoder's model. The method of research was to examine the practice of binding and loosing as a way to deal with personal offenses and internal church conflicts. Yoder believed that the practice also provided opportunities for communal moral discernment. Following those descriptions, the research explored Yoder's concept of translating practices through example, witness, and action and answered charges that his theology was “irresponsible,” because he did not advocate violence or “power” as methods for making social change. From that analysis, the modern VORP movement was analyzed, in order to determine if it was a valid translation of the practice of binding and loosing . Finally, the research explored characteristics of the kinds of communities that Yoder believed were capable of translating practices to the civil society, noted limiting factors in Yoder's own theology that might hamper translation, and offered suggestions for further opportunities for translation.",304788932,,Dissertations & Theses," Andersen, John Prinzing, Sr.AndersenPrinzingJohnSr.Andersen, John Prinzing, Sr.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727406261 , 28629971 , 66569 , 9780493739618 , 0493739610 , 3058744 , 3058744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493739618 , 0493739610", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304788932?accountid=14496," 0469 Theology , 0627 Criminology , 0318 Religion"," 0469 Theology , 0627 Criminology , 0318 Religion"," 0469 Theology , 0627 Criminology , 0318 Religion",," 0469 Theology , 0627 Criminology , 0318 Religion"," Theology , Criminology , Religion , Victims of crime , Reconciliation , Yoder, John Howard"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Binding and loosing , Ecclesial , Forgiveness , Victim Offender Reconciliation Program , Yoder, John Howard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=John+Howard+Yoder%27s+conception+of+the+ecclesial+practice+of+binding+and+loosing+as+applied+to+the+Victim+Offender+Reconciliation+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Andersen%2C+John+Prinzing%2C+Sr.&amp;isbn=9780493739618&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3702,The rise of ethical trade advocacy: NAFTA and the new politics of trade,"This dissertation focuses on three empirically linked questions: (1) who were the new coalitional actors that gained prominence during NAFTA, and why did they coalesce at this time; (2) how did non-governmental actors in the U.S. transform the trade policy debate during NAFTA and beyond; and (3) why were U.S. environmentalists able to achieve greater gains under NAFTA than other coalitional actors, and in particular more than politically influential U.S. labor activists. Because of systemic changes that integrated northern Mexico into U.S. manufacturing and expanded the scope of trade policy into domestic regulatory law, activists in different social movement sectors prior to NAFTA were increasingly coming to view their interests as threatened by the same trade liberalization agenda. This would create the seeds for “ethical trade advocacy,” or advocacy that promotes efforts to maintain regulatory safeguards as economic activity ratchets up from the national to an international level. These ethical trade advocates included activists that had not previously mobilized on trade issues, and they would find their combined strength and full articulation in the NAFTA fight. The ability of domestic actors to influence international regime negotiations depends in part on their own state's receptivity to mobilization at three political levels: (1) the relevant policy domain; (2) the legislative domain; and (3) the larger political action field. Each political level corresponds to a different dominant type of non-governmental leverage: (1) suasion through the alignment of interests in the policy domain; (2) alliances with decision-makers in legislative bodies; and (3) mass mobilization of constituents or organizational members in the broader political action field. Throughout the three years from the announcement of intent until final passage, U.S. NGOs would negotiate among the political fields in a dynamic process. Those non-state actors with alliances with access to the trade domain would focus most of their efforts on advocacy politics. Coalitional actors without such access would pursue a mixed approach that would combine congressional alliances and populace politics. The Bush administration would be able to use access to the trade domain itself to exploit divisions among environmentalists and split the more pro-growth activists from the rest of the cross-sectoral coalition. President Clinton would also exploit the same divisions to find a compromise that furthered environmental aims. Environmentalists would therefore gain substantively from their ability to add to labor's influence in threatening the agreement, while benefiting from their ability to distance themselves from labor concerns. However, the NAFTA battle also demonstrates the continued importance of the systemic international context in which negotiators find themselves. Even the dominance of the U.S. could not guarantee the inclusion of the strong labor rights protections. Mexican and Canadian negotiators would be influenced by their own domestic political configurations; the zero-sum nature of the supplemental agreements would further limit the negotiating leverage of U.S. trade representatives in their efforts to obtain strong protections. Mexican negotiators would risk the failure of the agreement by declaring that their bottom line was the maintenance of their industrial relations system, and U.S. negotiators would have no substantive concessions to offer in exchange for a softening of that stance.

A focus on cultural labour as a space of potential intervention and partial agency in an ongoing negotiation between fluctuating conceptions of the local and the global can facilitate a generative alignment of cultural production with movements seeking social justice. Critical readings of texts that have been written and published in recent years offer situated efforts to imagine and perhaps prompt enactments of solidarity across fields of labour such as menial, sexual and cultural work. The cumulative effect of bringing together a complex of texts that address these fields—such as Loveruage by Ashok Mathur, China Dog and Other Tales From a Chinese Laundry by Judy Fong Bates, The Excluded Wife by Yuen-Fong Woon, fiction and poetry by Evelyn Lau, T his Place Called Absence by Lydia Kwa, Gold by the Inch by Lawrence Chua, Disappearing Moon Cafe by SKY Lee, Baroque-a-nova by Kevin Chong, Exile and the Heart by Tamai Kobayashi, The Very Inside edited by Sharon Lim-Ring, Premonitions edited by Walter Lew, and more—is to value the performance of cultural production as a site from which alliance construction might begin. A refusal to accept the normalized and institutionalized devaluation of racialized and gendered labour performed by “Asian” bodies can translate into coalitional ways of proceeding which incorporate tactics of reciprocity, affiliation, and conjunction without ignoring or eliding power inequities. Reading menial, sexual, and cultural labour into a rapprochement with anti-imperialist and diasporic modes of consciousness can encourage fluencies and dialogues through situating “Asian” in relation to “Aboriginal” and also through the dispersal and conscientious breakdown of “Asian” in examples of textual coalitions otherwise known as anthologies. In the spirit of proliferation, juxtaposition, and affinities in difference, mobile reading practices can provide a process of producing value and have the potential to meet in synergy with other efforts on the long and necessary trajectory of constructing social justice.",305436064,,Dissertations & Theses," Wong, RitaWongRitaWong, Rita", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764796251 , 29215411 , 66569 , 9780612817043 , 0612817040 , NQ81704 , NQ81704", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780612817043 , 0612817040", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305436064?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature"," Comparative literature , Literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Asian , Labor , Racialization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Provisional+mobilities%3A++Rethinking+labour+through+Asian+racialization+in+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wong%2C+Rita&amp;isbn=9780612817043&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3704,"Mysticism and utopia: Towards the sociology of self -knowledge and human architecture (a study in Marx, Gurdjieff, and Mannheim)","This dissertation explores in an integrative world-historical framework the underlying paradigmatic causes of failure of past utopistic efforts towards a just global society. The conceptual structures of three western utopian, eastern mystical, and academic approaches represented in Marx, Gurdjieff, and Mannheim are studied using a postdeterminist dialectical methodology. Contributions are: (1) problematizing Marx's dialectic itself as a cause of failures of his doctrine; (2) an independent academic assessment of the teaching of Gurdjieff, the Caucasian mystic, using all his writings; (3) transforming Mannheim's sociology of knowledge into a sociology of self knowledge to help revitalize his intentions while avoiding his self-defeating arguments; (4) developing a conceptual synthesis beyond the three teachings within an alternative ""human architecture"" paradigm; (5) advancing a nonreductive dialectical method cognizant of the challenge posed by subconsciousness in mediations of mind and matter. A fundamental explanation for human failures in bringing about radical change is found to be the problem of habituation, i.e., the human propensity to become subconsciously attached to sensations, ideas, feelings, things, relations, and processes. The key obstacles are identified as the habituated dualisms of mind/matter, self/society, and theory/practice---responsible for the world-historical splitting of the essentially creative human search for the good life into mutually alienated philosophical utopian, religious mystical, and scientific academic movements corresponding to the transitions from ancient civilizations to classical political, medieval cultural, and modern economic empires. The good life cannot be the gift of a wise few, of supernatural forces beyond, or of an objectively preordained progress. Human de-alienation can only be an artful endeavor by each and all---only creative humanism can overcome the habituated fragmentations of utopistic efforts in favor of the good life. The study posits that all dualisms can be transcended through their re-articulation as manifestations of part-whole dialectics. The habituated definition of society as ""multiple"" ethno-national or civilizational systems of relations among ""individuals"" is rejected in favor of its definition as a singular world-historical ensemble of intra-, inter-, and extrapersonal self relations. It is argued that human life can be harmonious only when it is a world-system of self-determining individualities. World-history is viewed as a process of splitting of human life into a habituated east-west civilizational dualism whose transcendence is dependent on creative, conscious, and intentional human effort. The sociology of self-knowledge and human architecture are introduced as the study and practice of spatiotemporal part/whole dialectics between here-and-now self-identities and world-historical social structures.

In addressing this question I draw on a 15-month, multi-sited ethnographic study in several pediatric health care settings, following patients from primary care clinics, to emergency rooms, and in-patient units. The analysis focuses on the practices that go into documenting patients' histories and care, which include recordings on various on-line systems, preprinted forms, and whiteboards. By combining the previously distinct lenses of (1) knowing in practice, (2) time-space analysis of social interaction, and (3) communicative genre and genre systems, I suggest that doctors and nurses employ various types of document genres to manage, not only their distributed knowing about patients' care, but also their own movements across time-space. I outline a perspective on documents and knowing which attempts to highlight the role of human practice in how people use documents to coordinate their activities, share their capabilities, and get things done in complex distributed organizational work. The data suggest that doctors and nurses use medical documents as maps and itineraries to organize their distributed work practices. Doctors and nurses record patients' histories many times in different documents, with each document serving as a map and itinerary for a different constituency of people. Each of these documents is rarely used in isolation from other documents. Doctors and nurses constantly recombine the documents they use, which allows them to both appropriate documents from other settings into their local organization of work and build unique local combinations of documents. I introduce the concept of “re-localizing” to describe how doctors and nurses use documents to share their knowing within and across healthcare settings. Re-localization involves many healthcare professionals' parallel rewriting of a patient's history based on a recombination of each other's maps and itineraries and the patient's own accounts. By integrating the concrete case and the maps and itineraries based on those cases the notion of re-localization overcomes the dichotomy between the abstract and the situated, the local and global. Documents are not seen as mere vessels for abstract representations, but integral parts of distributed knowing within and across settings.

An argument for critical cosmopolitan histories of harm,"This dissertation presents an argument for approaches to history-writing that might re-animate the political and ethical projects of `‘history from below’ in the face of the global realities, political and academic, of the twenty-first century. The argument is premised on the conviction that historiography is suasive, and that it is both political (addressing and intervening in relations of power) and moral (necessarily communicating and shaping judgments of value). While revisions to theoretical understandings and changes in the self-definition, the reach and the vigour of social movements have dramatically altered the context for ‘history from below’ as a project, I argue that inequality and violence require, from all of us, critical judgments based on historical understanding—require, that is, ‘just history’. After a review of some of the aims and the accomplishments of what I call ‘challenger histories’, the dissertation addresses three dimensions of history-writing that need re-consideration: the subjects of history, its boundaries, and its production in the academy. With respect to each of these dimensions, I argue against narrow construals of who ‘deserves’ a history (not just workers, say, or women; not just fellow-citizens; not just fellow-scholars), and argue for a cosmopolitan egalitarianism that would encourage the most inclusive possible recognition of moral obligation. At the same time, I argue for an attention to harm as a practice whose effects our histories should illuminate and whose eradication our political practice should seek to effect. Central to my concerns is the question of ‘just history's’ audience. ‘Challenger histories’ typically imagined their subjects and their audiences to be, in some sense, fellows, be that fellowship one of class, gender or nation. I argue that to reconcile the ethical demands of attending to those most harmed and marginalized with the structural constraints of academic knowledge-production requires that we re-consider both who our audiences are and with which rhetorical strategies we might best address them. While earlier ‘challenger histories’ might be said to have encouraged consciousness-building among the powerless in order to make them less so, I argue that academic ‘just history’ might also address the powerful, to demonstrate, and to encourage critical reflection on, the harms in which they (we) are implicated. My argument, then, is that ‘just history’ will entail critical cosmopolitan histories of harm.",305491526,,Dissertations & Theses," Heftler, VictoriaHeftlerVictoriaHeftler, Victoria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764850311 , 29206731 , 66569 , 061271988X , 9780612719880 , NQ71988 , NQ71988", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 061271988X , 9780612719880", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305491526?accountid=14496, 0578 History, 0578 History, 0578 History,, 0578 History, History," Social sciences , Cosmopolitan , Harm , History from below , Just history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Just+history%3F++An+argument+for+critical+cosmopolitan+histories+of+harm&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heftler%2C+Victoria&amp;isbn=061271988X&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3707,"Indigenous federations, NGOs, and the state: *Development and the politics of culture in Ecuador's Amazon","This dissertation studies indigenous federations in Amazonian Ecuador, and the historically changing relationships between them and the Ecuadorian state, national and international non-governmental development organizations (NGOs), and multinational oil companies. Their interaction is partially situated within conflicting understandings of development and its objectives, in which development is understood both in economic and cultural terms. State elites and NGO personnel typically view development in terms of economic modernization, and state policies and NGO projects for Amazonian indigenous communities have included agrarian reform, colonization, and the wider participation of indigenous people in the market economy. Elites and NGOs attempt to impose particular visions of economic and cultural behavior on indigenous people as “backwards” and “underdeveloped,” while hoping to transform them into “modern,” “productive” national citizens. Since the 1960s, indigenous leaders have used federations to contest these models of development by negotiating with and/or challenging state and NGO officials, rejecting the perpetuation of culturally-based hierarchies with pseudo-racial undertones which relegate indigenous people to the bottom. Increasingly since the 1980s, and in the context of neoliberal reforms and the rapid growth of NGOs in Ecuador and elsewhere, indigenous leaders, instead of rejecting “development” altogether, have used it as a stake in cultural politics by forging alliances with sustainable development and conservation NGOs. They have proposed alternative visions of development to reconfigure local economies in culturally-sensitive terms, dismantle prevailing “racial” hierarchies, and reconceptualize the Ecuadorian nation as plurinational. The study of indigenous federations helps broaden our understanding of the relationships between social movements and the state in the context of economic, political, and socio-cultural processes shaping them. Ideologies of development, globally conceived by international development organizations and locally implemented through neoliberal reforms, decentralization, and permissive expansion of NGOs, present a multi-dimensional stage on which economic and cultural politics are played out. This has further implications for our understanding of “race,” ethnicity, and the politics of culture, as development ideologies and practices generate prescriptions for the ethnic and cultural (pseudo-racial) composition of local populations. Development becomes intertwined with issues of cultural politics and national identity, as different actors create and contest conflicting representations of each other.",305492721,,Dissertations & Theses," Wilson, Patrick CharlesWilsonCharlesPatrickWilson, Patrick Charles", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726485751 , 28632021 , 66569 , 9780493696829 , 0493696822 , 3054356 , 3054356", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493696829 , 0493696822", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305492721?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Political science , Economics , Social structure , Native peoples , Nongovernmental organizations--NGOs , Studies , Politics"," Social sciences , Amazon , Culture , Development , Ecuador , Indigenous federations , Nongovernmental organizations , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indigenous+federations%2C+NGOs%2C+and+the+state%3A+++*Development+and+the+politics+of+culture+in+Ecuador%27s+Amazon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+Patrick+Charles&amp;isbn=9780493696829&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3708,"From above and below: The Mormon embrace of revolution, 1840–1940","Scholars have traced Mormonism's 19th century revolutionary nationalism, but the leadership's response to the revolutions of other peoples has received little attention. The Mormon hierarchy believed that Christ's return represented the millenarian “revolution from above” that would catapult them to global leadership. Driven west, the Revolutions of 1848 opened another narrative. Revolts “from below” would overthrow the privileged classes and dignify the masses. Revolution weakened traditional loyalties and destroyed the religious, political, and social monopolies that inhibited missionary work. To expresses their millennialism, Mormon leaders integrated the language and symbols pioneered by secular revolutionaries. This dissertation argues that revolution sustained the Mormon view of history. God was omniscient. He projected his power in the medium of time through the agency of man. World events became a source of canon. If revolution was possible, ran the logic, then it was God's will to pursue it. Revolution often endowed Mormon scriptural interpretations with new meaning. Mormon acceptance of revolution shows their millennial theology as a progressive discourse. The dialectical movement of history would produce global conditions imagined in French democratic totalitarianism: universal property, brotherhood, personal fulfillment, and endowments of knowledge and responsibilities that citizenship in the earthly kingdom conveyed. Mormons, like revolutionary utopians, condoned force. The object was to shape society into what it could become. After 1890 assimilation with normative values accelerated, but the Mormon script resisted total Americanization. Anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist undercurrents continued to inform Mormon views of the external world. The Mexican Revolution and political coups in South America in 1930–1931 let Latter-day Saint leaders explore the global implications of their message for 50 years beyond the abandonment of polygamy and the political kingdom of God. The crises of the 1930s collapsed Mormon faith in progress toward a rational world illuminated with spiritual understanding. Furthermore, socioreligious radicalism lost relevance in an institutionalized Church. That leading Mormon leaders ratified efforts in post revolutionary Mexico and the Soviet Union suggests their internal uneasiness with incorporation and their yearning for utopia.",305499165,,Dissertations & Theses," Livingston, CraigLivingstonCraigLivingston, Craig", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726358471 , 28387651 , 66569 , 9780493536798 , 0493536795 , 3040337 , 3040337", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493536798 , 0493536795", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305499165?accountid=14496," 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history"," 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history"," 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history",," 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history"," Religious congregations , Latin American history"," Social sciences , Mexico , Mormon , Revolution",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+above+and+below%3A++The+Mormon+embrace+of+revolution%2C+1840%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Livingston%2C+Craig&amp;isbn=9780493536798&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3709,For the pleasures of it: Novel objects and enlightened subjects in eighteenth-century England,"Eighteenth-century England's transformation into a consumer and global society entangled an “ethics of artifice” with object-oriented markers of subjectivity. Richardson's Clarissa , Burney's Camilla and Evelina and Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure , as well as prose by Fielding, Mandeville, Addison and Steele, and libertine verse, show that as manufactured and exotic commodities crowded eighteenth-century England, its human inhabitants became intensely aware of their power to supplement, as well as ornament the self. Commodity culture worked in productive tension with Enlightenment standards of knowing as evinced in experimental methods and empirical philosophy to animate the mutable and fictive potentials of the modern human subject. Treating the novel as a lively aesthetic site for representing new forms of subjectivity, I argue that its grammar of objects—those bountiful catalogues of “minute particulars”—not only reflects a new public access to exotic goods promising status and beauty, but also, converts the self into “a thing.” Remaining interested in tracing the languages of objects and objectivity in eighteenth-century English novels while dwelling also on the “originality” of their form, my work joins the dialogue started by Ian Watt and Michael McKeon in their respective books Rise of the Novel and Origins of the English Novel . My study diverges from theirs, though, in moving beyond a focus on “the novel” as a privileged aesthetic form that contains, reflects or produces social values in an imaginative fashion, and viewing it as a constitutive element in eighteenth-century culture's more pervasive movements of novelty.

My analysis of Ada Gobetti's “life of resistance” proposes a broader definition, one that includes not only armed resistance during wartime, but any action that fought against the obstruction of freedom, the limitation of human rights, or the restriction of knowledge imposed by a political power. Ada's resistance activities comprised actions not often considered under the rubric of resistance, such as translating a controversial historical work from English into Italian, which was censored by the Fascists in 1939, and writing an anti-Fascist children's book in 1940. While the Resistenza represented a culmination of more than twenty years of anti-Fascist activity for Ada, it also brought the beginning of an awareness of the specific talents, needs, and rights of Italian women, more than one hundred thousand of whom participated in the Resistenza . This realization led Ada to organize other Italian women into defense and assistance groups and to found an underground women's newspaper. In early 1945, she crossed the Alps on foot and made contact with women in the French Resistance in Grenoble. Ada's “coming of age” during the Resistenza provides us with a fresh view of the Resistenza as a liberator of women's strengths and possibilities. After the war ended, Ada's experience as a resister developed into a constructive political and social activism. As vice mayor of Turin, she fought openly for the rights of women and children in Italian society. She witnessed the birth of the Italian Republic, officially proclaimed on 18 June 1946 after the first election where women could vote, and worked to integrate women into the decision-making process of the country. Ada also became deeply involved in the international women's rights movement, traveling to Paris, Berlin, and China as a representative from Italy. For Ada Gobetti, resistance to tyranny and oppression became a way of life, part of a profound commitment to humanity, justice, and freedom.",305507572,,Dissertations & Theses," Alano, JomarieAlanoJomarieAlano, Jomarie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726397151 , 28388181 , 66569 , 9780493585635 , 049358563X , 3044823 , 3044823", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493585635 , 049358563X", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305507572?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies , 0304 Biographies"," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies , 0304 Biographies"," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies , 0304 Biographies",," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies , 0304 Biographies"," European history , Womens studies , Biographies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Gobetti, Ada Prospero Marchesini , Italy , Resistance , World War II",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+life+of+resistance%3A++Ada+Prospero+Marchesini+Gobetti+%281902%E2%80%931968%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alano%2C+Jomarie&amp;isbn=9780493585635&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3711,New media activism: Alternative media and new technologies from video to the digital age,"Since the introduction of the Sony Portapak, the first commercially available video camera in the late 1960s, alternative media practitioners in the United States have utilized new and emerging electronic media technologies to support their political and social activism. This dissertation focuses on three major new media forms that have been integral to activism in the United States since the late 1960s: video, satellite broadcasting and the Internet. Specifically, I examine how alternative media collectives have been early adopters of new communication technologies and create their own systems of alternative communication, including the production, exhibition and distribution of progressive, radical and activist media texts. While many analyses of this topic have been conducted in the fields of communication, political science, sociology and journalism, this dissertation approaches the study of activism and new media primarily from the methodologies of cinema and television studies, especially documentary and avant-garde film theories. I analyze several widely circulated activist media texts, including Top Value Television's (TVTV) video Four More Years (1972), Deep Dish Television's television series Gulf Crisis TV Project (1991), and the Independent Media Center's (IMC) video Showdown in Seattle (1999) and web site at www.indymedia.org. Using these representative examples, I argue that alternative media texts frequently blur the boundaries between documentary and avant-garde techniques. Alternative media productions often utilize documentary-style realism combined with avant-garde sensibilities in order to merge media production, politics and everyday life into a transformational political and social praxis. Finally, these grassroots, independent, non-corporate media practices exist in a core-periphery relationship to dominant hegemonic media, and I examine the introduction of each new major technology within and against the political economy of mainstream corporate media. Thus, I situate alternative media production within its industrial, material and historical contexts: the video collectives Videofreex and TVTV during the age of network television broadcasting in the early 1970s; Paper Tiger Television and Deep Dish Television and their creation of a national alternative media network in the age of satellite broadcasting in the 1980s and 1990s; and since 1999, the global IMC movement and their use of emerging digital technologies in the digital age.",305512352,,Dissertations & Theses," Edwards, Richard LawrenceEdwardsLawrenceRichardEdwards, Richard Lawrence", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765952631 , 29442591 , 66569 , 3094325 , 3094325", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305512352?accountid=14496," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0708 Mass media"," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0708 Mass media"," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0708 Mass media",," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0708 Mass media"," Motion Pictures , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Alternative media , Digital age , Media activism , New technologies , Video",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+media+activism%3A++Alternative+media+and+new+technologies+from+video+to+the+digital+age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Edwards%2C+Richard+Lawrence&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3712,"Neoliberalism and democracy? The gendered restructuring of work, unions and the Colombian public sphere","This dissertation investigates the political and economic outcomes of financial service restructuring in Colombia following the implementation of neoliberal reforms. Through an examination of the impacts of restructuring on the socio-economic and political security of workers, I challenge neoliberal assertions of the causal links between globalization and democracy. This project develops a critical analytical framework for understanding the relationship between economic and political liberalization by looking closely at how labor market restructuring processes affect the everyday lives of workers. Through an in-depth analysis of how the political lives and subjectivities of financial service workers have been affected by workplace reforms, I contribute to wider debates on the relationship between work and citizenship. This multi-scalar analysis traces the mechanisms of neoliberalism from the arenas of international investment down to the lived experiences of workers and unionists. I suggest that restructuring strategies such as downsizing, peripheralization and outsourcing operated through and reinforced unequal gender and class subjectivities of workers and exacerbated economic and political insecurity and marginalization. I explore the response of women workers and banking unionists to the unrealized opportunities promised by both neoliberal and democratic reforms. I track the emergence of new political identities forged through the struggles of women banking unionists to democratize the labor movement and to draw attention to the differing concerns of women and other marginalized workers in the face of neoliberal restructuring. I analyze the ways in which women unionists draw from their experiences of empowerment and inclusion in social movements in attempts to expand the direct participation and decision-making power of women workers and unionists. This research included a pre-dissertation study was conducted in Bogotá in 1997 and fieldwork carried out from 1999–2000. In order to overcome the obstacles of carrying out research in the context of Colombia's ongoing civil war, I developed a feminist, participatory and engaged approach that allowed me to directly address differences of power and vulnerability. This largely qualitative study included in-depth interviews, ethnography, participant observation and the gathering of secondary data.

Chapter 1 presents an historic synopsis of the money/punishment amalgam, traces the experience of key stakeholders, CCA and Wackenhut, and presents a précis of present policy and research issues. Chapter 2 examines the policy in light of the new global economy. It traces the relationship between the diminution of state-based legitimative clout and the privatization of correctional facilities. By repositioning seemingly intractable governance issues within the more fashionable discourse of efficient management, privatization offers the illusion of downsizing while functioning to increase the state's punitive reach. The prison industrial complex has proffered prisons as an economic solution to a range of socio-political problems, including the need for rural development and the question of what to do with economically unproductive populations. Chapter 3 discusses the symbolic and concrete ramifications of public/private divide. It asks whether a greater reliance on the “private” privileges the emotive and the vengeful at the expense of the considered and the just. At the same time, it examines whether the singular, uncompetitive features of the corrections industry are amenable to market place discipline. Chapter 4 traces the relationship between an exaggerated piety, a veneration for business acumen and the privatization movement. It suggests the importance of our Puritan, Social Darwinian legacy. Proffering penal expansion as counterpoint to a fragmented, postmodern polity. Chapter 5 examines the structural etiology and ramifications of an ever more punitive sentencing structure. Chapter 6 concludes that privatization fails to meet a spectrum of ethical tenets. Essentially neutral to normative mandates, beneficent, non-maleficent obligations are extrinsic to privatization's profit-focused objectives.

Accepting the myth of American exceptionalism, he believed that America should not become entangled with Europe lest its character become eroded. A new foreign policy, “thoroughly American” in purpose, had to be devised. Wilson sought acceptance of American democratic values by other societies in order to “redeem” them. This would permit American leadership in the world without involving the United States in the Old World's diplomacy and wars. Wilson's faith in American exceptionalism is evident in his ideas about how to regenerate the world through the proliferation of democracy. He translated the experiences of America's democratic growth into principles that were universally applicable throughout the world. Wilson believed that if the twentieth-century world was to be open, safe and free, then it must become more like America. Democracy had to be based on “civic manhood,” the cultural and political requisite of political stability. “Civic manhood,” the quintessential virtue of mature races and the cornerstone of Americanism, involved a demonstrated commitment to Anglo-Saxon culture; an observance of progressive change from above; a faith in free enterprise; and an embrace of Protestant Christianity. Wilson considered the propagation of this blueprint for nation-building to be America's mission in the world. Americanism transcended Anglo-Saxonism, the “White Man's Burden,” and the Social Gospel movement. While its dimensions were complex and often contradictory, the objective of Americanism was simple: the fusion of American and world conceptions of progress, security, and prosperity through the worldwide extension of American-style democracy. Wilson first articulated his view of America's mission in the world in association with the Philippine question. He believed it was critical to keep Philippine policy in line with America's redemptive mission in the world. Failure to do so would yield disastrous consequences for democracy in the Philippines and America's credibility as “redeemer nation.”",305537707,,Dissertations & Theses," Hamel, William ChristopherHamelChristopherWilliamHamel, William Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765121381 , 28635391 , 66569 , 9780493951737 , 0493951733 , 3075014 , 3075014", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493951737 , 0493951733", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305537707?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0582 History"," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0582 History"," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0582 History",," 0337 American history , 0332 History , 0582 History"," American history , History"," Social sciences , Foreign relations , Philippines , Race , Responsible government , Wilson, Woodrow",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Race+and+responsible+government%3A++Woodrow+Wilson+and+the+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hamel%2C+William+Christopher&amp;isbn=9780493951737&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3715,Out of hand: Experimental media practices by women,"Out of Hand: Experimental Media Practices by Women surveys a 30-year history of feminist media production, including film, video, installation, and new media, charting the projects of artists who work tactically, using the term as it is defined by French theorist Michel de Certeau. The study charts shifts in technology, working methods, feminist issues, and the notion of an alternative media practice within the United States, focusing mainly on feminist media projects from 1990 forward. The study also situates these projects in the larger contexts of the history of avant-garde cinema, video art, and the art world, illustrating links to the poststructuralist tactics of appropriation, narrative experimentation, and identity subversion that characterize feminist artwork in general. The study also tackles the ways in which contemporary feminist media artists are continuing to grapple with how to understand and resist the sense of political and social disorientation that in the early 1990s helped reduce what remained of a feminist movement to near non-existence. Another issue asks where, as the entertainment, telecommunication, and international business industries continue to merge, should political resistance occur? Underlying these larger political questions is the ongoing project of rethinking the subject, dramatically questioned in terms of the matrix of race, class, and gender in 1960s experimental film and video and now reconfigured with attention to phenomenological inflections of the world around us, and to technology. A third issue is that of the body, now understood to be thoroughly imbricated in technology such that the boundary separating body and machine has become malleable, with one the supplement to the other. While much attention has been paid in feminist analysis to the political insurgency of the notion of the cyborg, the complex interconnectedness of the body, both physical and psychic, within an increasingly altered conception of space and time, demands more consideration. Finally, the destabilization of the spatial realm and the rethinking of our abilities for cognitive mapping are radically altering how we conceptualize all acts, and therefore the very possibility for resistance.",305547294,,Dissertations & Theses," Willis, Holly LaingWillisLaingHollyWillis, Holly Laing", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765953241 , 29442591 , 66569 , 3094423 , 3094423", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002,, English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305547294?accountid=14496," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0357 Fine Arts , 0708 Mass media , 0453 Womens studies"," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0357 Fine Arts , 0708 Mass media , 0453 Womens studies"," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0357 Fine Arts , 0708 Mass media , 0453 Womens studies",," 0900 Motion Pictures , 0357 Fine Arts , 0708 Mass media , 0453 Womens studies"," Motion Pictures , Fine Arts , Mass media , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Experimental media , Installation art , Media , Video art , Women artists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Out+of+hand%3A+Experimental+media+practices+by+women&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Willis%2C+Holly+Laing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3716,"Globalization, peace and discontent: Israel and Northern Ireland","The oscillation of the conflicts in Israel and Northern Ireland in recent years between advances towards peaceful resolution and regressions to new cycles of bloodshed were explained by the inherent difficulties of territorial compromise, security threats, and effective political campaigns drawing on fears. This dissertation proposes an entirely different explanation that involves an analysis at the International level, regarding the process of globalization, at the national level, at globalization's more local effects on the social structures and institutions and a historical study comparing two different periods of globalization. The point of departure of this work is that globalization is a transformation of the world system through a “hegemonic crisis”. Comparing two periods in which hegemonic crises occurred, the decline of the “Pax Britannica” of the late 19 th century and the American “embedded liberalism” of the late 20 th century, this work examines their effect on the dynamics of the conflicts and their resolutions. The first part, which explores the early period of globalization and the related development of the two conflicts, is an historical research based upon secondary materials. The second part, which focuses on the current period of globalization, is based on a combination of primary and secondary materials. Primary materials include archival research, review of media reports and a series of open interviews with leading businessmen involved in the peace process. They were interviewed for the purpose of identifying the perceptions of businessmen of the peace process and globalization, assessing their involvement in the peace process and their impact upon it. The period of early globalization was characterized by growing nationalism and a territorializing drive and influenced the crystallization of the Jewish, Palestinian and Irish national movements. The current period of globalization is characterized by a tension between de-territorializing and re-territorializing developments. While the former created new incentives for the business class and affiliates to support resolution of the conflicts the latter created “spoilers” who perceived negatively the peace process and globalization. The tension between the two explains the impasses the two peace processes face, yet different local circumstances and local-global interactions explain the different outcomes of the processes.",305575494,,Dissertations & Theses," Ben-Porat, GuyBen-PoratGuyBen-Porat, Guy", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726400621 , 28393001 , 66569 , 9780493605562 , 0493605568 , 3046419 , 3046419", Dissertation/Thesis, 2002," 9780493605562 , 0493605568", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305575494?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science," Political science , Globalization , Israel , Ireland"," Social sciences , Discontent , Globalization , Israel , Northern Ireland , Peace",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Globalization%2C+peace+and+discontent%3A++Israel+and+Northern+Ireland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ben-Porat%2C+Guy&amp;isbn=9780493605562&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3717,Research On Development of Chinese Private Economy,"Abstract 1. The Significance of Research. The renascence and rapid-development of private economy has become a prominent phenomenon in China since the reform and opening up. Thus, it is a research work of both practical and theoretical significance to analyze the problems existing in private economy and raise the proper solutions to them. This dissertation centers on the key word DEVELOPMENT, and deals with three problems. Firstly, figuring out the social and economic origins of the renascence of the private economy, depicting its tracks of developments and changes; then, summarizing the traits of the developments of the private economy in China. Secondly, expounding and pining the foundation of the existence of private economy in three main aspects: productive force determinism, mixture ownership and socialism marketing economy determinism. Thirdly, Focusing on analyzing the existing problems of privately-owned enterprise, from the outside surroundings of privately-owned enterprise development, money raising problem and administration mechanism creativeness, then raising saluting tailings and relating tactics. 2. Dissertation composition. The dissertation induces 9 chapters. The first chapter is the introduction. In this chapter, it firstly expounds the motivation and significance of this dissertation, defining the meaning of Private Economy. Then it introduces the undergoing situation in studies on private economy by academia. Finally, it introduces the studying method and composition of this dissertation, focusing on analyzing and defining the meaning of Private Economy. This dissertation dissents from the phenomenon commonly existing in theories circles and enterprises circles that the nongovernmental business taking the place of private economy. It points out that nongovernmental business is an operating pattern. This phenomenon just shows the apprehension, discrimination and prejudice towards private economy in somebody’s mind. In chapter 2, it analyses the social and economic conditions of the regeneration of private economy at the beginning of the reform and its following development. It analyzes three basic terms of the regenerations private economy from a view of production logic: Firstly, the individual must have some capital accumulation, but the primitive capital accumulation of the privately owned enterprises in China depends mainly on diligence, which is different from the capitalism society. Secondly, there must be an opening productive factors and commodity market, providing a broad market conditions for the emergence of private economy. Thirdly, the policies should provide legitimacy for the production. The development of china’s private economy could generally be decide into four phrases: the first phrase (1978-1988) is the period of its germination and preliminary development. The second phrase (1989-1992) is the period of its fluctuation; 1992-2002 is its third phrase, when the private economy came into a period of stable development, and its position rose quickly in national economy. After the opening of the 16th Chinese Community Party at the end of 2002, private economy came into its fourth phrase—a new and vigorous rising period. In chapter 3, the dissertation illustrates the developments of private economy after 1989 by using numbers of statistics data. It expounds from 4 aspects: Firstly, showing general conditions of private enterprises’ development from their numbers, registered capital, employees, value of output, consumer goods entail amount and enterprise scale, then pointing out that it’s the fastest developing economy component after reform and opening and up. Secondly, analyzing the private economy’s importance in National Economy increase by promoting economy increase tax increase labor admission. Export foreign exchange earning and other aspects. Thirdly, by analyzing the distribution conditions, traits and causes of the private economy in the three industries and specific trade, pointing out that it mainly distributes in the processing and manufacturing industry, commerce and accommodation industry currently. There’s on of fen private enterprises in other fields. At last, it analyzes the town and country distribution, area distribution and city clistribation conditions, traits and causes. Pointing out that private economy mainly distributed in the urban, eastern area and economically developed provinces in china. In chapter 4, the dissertation summarizes the traits of private economy in china. Its main characteristics are: 1. Regressive growth in economy system. 2. Its growth expedited a position chime — from supplementing component outside the system to important one inside the system. 3. Private capital increases quickly in value in china, but it’s at its alimentary phrase generally. 4. Many private enterprises are developing under concealment. 5. There are no abundant explanations of the existence and development of private property rights theoretically in china. In chapter 5, the dissertation analyzes and assesses three-motivation theory of the necessary existence and development of the private economy in China. Productive force determinism argues that productive force development decides the existence and development of Private Economy. In this dissertation, it points out that the contradictory movement principle of the productive force and production relationship in Marxism is a right principle forever. But the relation between productive-force and productive material ownership forms is not a simple corresponding one. We can’t simplify Productive Force Determinism to productive force multi-stratification correspondence theory Mixing Ownership theory argues that neither contemporary capitalism nor Chinese Socialism marketing economy is founded on the basis of single ownership form and economy operating system. But both of them are mixing economy—coexistence of public and private ownership, and concurrence of planned economy and marketing economy. Besides affirmation of its mixing trait, the dissertation points out that there are still vast differences between the two in generating mechanism and basically traits. And analyzes the different function positioning in Chinese and western mixing economy emphasizing that socialism marketing economy is a kind of ecological economy. Marketing Economy System Determinism argues that socialism marketing economy system underlies the existence, and development of the Private Economy in China. The present dissertation considers that the private economy is an accentual micro-basic indispensable socialism marketing economy, which demands poly-subjects’ competition, Additionally, it analyses the important role played by the private economy in the development of socialism marketing system, and points out that the private economy and public ownership economy not only compete and confront against each other, but also complement to each other. In chapter 6, the present dissertation analyzes the development trend of the private economy in china. Firstly, it analyzes its position in national economy and its future orientation, and points out that its role has changed from complimentary one to major mainstay of basic economy system at the elementary phrase of socialism, But its position in ownership construction is still a complimentary one, For its orientation, I think it would most probably play a major role, but we can’t make specific vision and depiction, Secondly, it analyzes many favorable conditions for the private economy in the new century as follows: Besides state-owned economies strategic adjustment WTO provides precious developing chance for it. Perfecting socialism marketing economy system creates advantageous system conditions for the further development of private economy, loose policy surroundings and economy environment also push forward it development positively, At last, the essay points out the development trend of production form, management level, industry construction, area distribution and other aspects of the private economy. Chapter 7 analyzes the external factors which restrict the development of private enterprises. It points out four extreme factors that are still restricting the development of the pirate enterprises. The first factor exists in people’s t way of thinking, including their rejection to the “private” and the traditional ideology of “solely economic composition theory” and “paying more attention to the ethic than to profit” and “paying more attention to the public wellbeing than to the private imterestes”, which has limited the passion and motivation for the creation of the fortune. Thus the society should build a culture and value system that would adapt to the development of the market economy.The second factor exists in the currier policies and regulations. It mainly presents as: the policies and regulations for the private economy have never got one of the frame of “utilizing, limiting. There are not enough statutes to ensure the property right of the private enterprise. The legislation for the main bodies of the market is sill at the phase of Dual System. And the social services can not adapt to or satisfy the needs of the development of private enterprises. The efforts of the government are still needed to construct a environment with regulation treats everybody equally without discrimination and encourages fair competition.Thirdly, there are some factors in the macro-management system, including some obscurities and conflicts on the definition of the administrative rights of the private economy. Besides, the situation of multi-department supervision stillexist under the mode of planned economy, So we should strengthen the macro-management for the private economy and enhance the servicing function to the private economy according to the requirements of the market economy. Fourthly it talks the challenges to the private enterprises in our country after we enter the WTO. The private enterprises should build up a global horizon and be familiar with the game rules as soon as possible to foster and enhance the international competition ability. Chapter 8 investigates the reasons for and proposes some approaches to, the difficulties in financing of the private enterprise. It points out two reasons: the inner reasons and the eternal reasons. The eternal reasons are that it is hard for private enterprises to gain support from credit market and capital market since our country’s special ownership structure and economy system formed in the switching period. The development of the private financial enterprises was also confined for the since teen. Additionally, there used to be some “identity discrimination” to the private economy in people’s awareness which results in the difficulty in financing of the private enterprises.The inner reasons are that most of the private enterprises are small in scale, asymmetry in information, not good in credit condition and not wholesome in hypothecate system. These factors increase the difficulties of financing. To solve the problems of the financing of the private enterprises, we should firstly deepen the reform of the financing system, actively develop different kinds of nongovernmental business banks and other financing institutions, especially private banks. Meanwhile, we should build and perfect the service system for the middle and smallsized enterprises. Chapter 9 discusses the property right and organization system in the private enterprises. It mainly teats of three problems: firstly, it explains present conditions of the organization system in Chinese private enterprises from the view of the evolvement of organization form of the financing in the nation’s private enterprises, decision-making system and etc., which bring forward the conclusion that the main characteristics of the inner management in Chinese private enterprises is family-dominant model. Secondly, it analyzes the problems of the property right system and organization system in Chinese private enterprises, including the centralization of the property right . 3.Main opinions and new creations. This paper brings forward the following opinions based on the summarizing, and absorbing existed academic research: 1.When comes to the definition of the meaning of the “private enterprises”, it claims to abolish Temporary Regulations for private enterprises in People’s Republic of China as soon as possible, to cease the division criteria of “seven employees no and eight employees yes” in the registration of the private enterprises, and to point out that private economy is a different definition from nongovernment economy . 2.On the basis of analyzing the condition of renaissance, development history and status quo of Chinese private enterprises, the thesis points out that the growing of the Chinese private enterprises was in a retroverse direction, growing from outer-institution to the inter-institution, obscured development and some other characteristics. From the scale, technology and facility, the level of management and some other factors, the Chinese private enterprises are mostly in the elementary phase. 3.The productivity is not simply correlated to the ownership of the produce materials. There seems to be no logical relationship between the form of the ownership and the productivity. It is not reliable both in theory and practice to conclude that the theory of the existence and development of Chinese private enterprises is the same as the theory of the multi-hierarchy and imbalanced development of productivity. 4. Modern market economy is a specific mutually complementary and coexistence economy group formed between different ownerships and forms of different economic operation systems and economic organizations. It is an impersonal phenomena in the mixed ownership system that some economic constitutions is main, while some others are subsidiary and all of them are mutually complementary and coexistence. Social market economy is also a kind of eco-economy. It needs the competition from various main bodies. It requires the force of the market competition to decide and adjust the proportion of the public ownership and private ownership in order to construct a dynamic mixed ownership structure that are suitable for the requirement of the development of the productivity. 5.To eliminate the outer unharmonious factors that restrict the development of the private enterprises, we should erect the conception of storing fortune for the people and treat the rich well in our mind and get rid of the frame of “utilizing and limiting” in regulation and adopt the measures that treat everybody equally without discrimination and encourage fair competition and modify the constitution to improve the statutes that protect the private estate in order that the private fortune has the same constitutional protect as the public fortune. 6.The reasons for the difficulties of the financing of the private enterprises has transformed rapidly from the “personal identification” discrimination to system obstacles and a symmetry in greeting in foremen. To settle the embarrassment of financing of the private sectors, the key is to break the situation that state-owned financing organization monopolizes the credit market and state-owned enterprises monopolizes the capital market, and to actively support and develop the nongovementel financing organization, especially some private financing organization such as the private bank. 7.Presently, there are some problems with the private enterprises including: the concentration and the singularity of the property right, the prevalence of the management under the mode of family-experience dominant, obvious family and politic love knot of the property right main body, undetachment of the ownership right and operation right, and low culture making and management level of the enterprise owner and etc confronted with these problems, we should promote the transforming the Chinese private enterprises from of the family-dominant operation mode to the normative modern corporation mode from three latitude: the right of controlling, management station and corporation configuration.

Theme parks in china emerged as the times require in 1980's. After a illustrious and overdeveloped period, nowadays theme parks in china, as a kind of carrier for civic recreational activities, have those two problems: 1. The macroscopical plan is not do its best, and lacks in surveying in base of the whole civic ecology. So that, economic movement and operation overweights attention to ecology,temporary behavior replaces long-term benefit, and individual will controls whole regulation.2. Planning designs have all their goods in the window superficialness, and lack in colligated designs from origin of the rules of the recreational planning. So that, profits as a basic exceeds human as a basic, business running weakens recreational experience, and assembled things blot out rude ideas.Above all, through the research of the development background and course of international theme parks, the present treatise is intended to make a brief illumination of the mainstream of the theme-park design by visual angle of the design mode. That means that cooperation, among subjects and interposition of leading technological ideas, has been changing the theme-park plan mode. Further, by visual angle of respectively tourism system, civic ecology, city planning &amp; landscape ecology, and territorial economics, the article searches the theoretic basic of the sustainable research of theme parks. At the same time, it's pointed out that the increasingly social function of theme parks surely makes big theme parks as green living rooms in cities. As a result, the conclusions of the article are two design methods to realize the sustainable development of theme parks. Firstly, theme parks should take the improvement of civic ecologic environment as a prime function. Secondly, theme parks themselves should be also a sustainable organism.

The universities and colleges in our country have been carrying out ""University/College-Department"" two-stage management mode. With the establishment of social market economy and the further reformation of university interior management mode, many universities and colleges have started to carry out college system since the reformation in 1978. College system reformation is still a newborn subject, a nonstandard college interior management mode, which right now is in the beginning stage both in theoretical research and in practical performance. College system reformation has been the key content in our university management mode reformation since the 1990s and it is also the key point and difficult point in the new round of university management mode reformation in the 21st century. It is rather necessary to learn experience from colleges abroad, to combine the reality of our universities, and to further our research. The significance of this study is to expose the reason of college system in theory and explain how the high schools could carry out the college system in practice. With the theory of modern education economy management as support and the implying of methods of documents analysis and social investigation, ""Research on College System Management Mode of Chinese Universities"" sums up the problems existing in the management mode reformation of Chinese universities, generalizes systematically the development of college system management mode, summarizes the reformation trend and analyzes the current problems in the present reformation. This passage studies the principles the reformation should follow and put forward the principles to establish the college management mode, which is suitable to Chines e present condition. The paper consists of five parts. Part One is Chapter One: "" The Significance of Research on College System Management Mode of Chinese Universities "". This part puts forward the problems in Chinese College system. That is, with the further reformation of college management mode, with the enlargement of college scale, with the development of science and technology and the requisition of the change in college organization after joining WTO, some problems are urgent to be settled during the course of College System Management Mode Reformation. This chapter also sums up the research results of relevant scholars and raises the aim and meaning for this research.? Part Two consists of Chapter Two?""The Historical Development of College System Management Mode"" and Chapter Three ? ""Motivation Analysis of College System Reformation in China"". This part studies the formation, types and reformation trend of college system abroad and sums up the content of college system reformation. This part points out that the college system reformation is dominated by the law of college education, driven by knowledge economy, market economy, popularization of the college education and the international environment. It is also the result of a series of conflict movement and administration impetus inside the college system. The reasons that cause the bad result of the reformation are the lack of the theoretical preparation, the incorrect understanding, the habitual in fluence, the barrier in culture, the adjustment in benefit, the question in management and the time delay in adaptation.? Part Three consists of Chapter Four ?""Resource Composition is the Base of the System Reformation "" and Chapter Five--- ""The Nature of College System Reformation is the Specialty of Collage Organization"". This part mainly discusses the reason for college system. It also points out that under the condition of market economy, the manner of material allocation inside colleges should give play to the government's leading role and the role of market. But at the same time the manner should adapt the administrative rank system and should prevent the market system from playing fundamental function. College system is the best way of allocat ion. This part analyzes the characters of college academic organization, major organization and administrative organization, therefore, demands that universities/colleges should adapt college system management mode. Part Four consists of Chapter Six? ""The Core of College System Reformation is the Integrity of Subjects"" , Chapter Seven ?

The changes and development must hence be rooted either on the basis of the succession, original reproduction and further development of the traditional education, or on the basis of the integration between humanities and science, of its mergence with the advanced model of the international journalism education. Set in a full-scoped research, the paper, using the theoretical studies (from two different approaches) as the starting points, carries out the detailed analysis on factors like process, characteristics, motivation and the like that promote and restrain development of the 80-year-old China's journalism education. The author then divides it into several phases like the budding and formation, the primary development, readjustment, crisis, recovery, popularity and prosperity. With its development and changes as the object, in the background of the condition of the current China's journalism, education and society, the author puts forward the reasons for the above division. There are also a detailed description of the scale, teaching and the department representatives of the journalism education at various stages on one side, and on the other, of the journalism thoughts of some famous journalist educators. The paper holds that the coming into being and the initial development of China's contemporary journalism offers a hotbed for the formation of China's journalism education, while the establishment of the system lays a strong foundation for the very formation. The author also points out that the New Culture Movement provides an incentive for the birth of China's journalism education, and that the setting up of the Journalism Society in Beijing University marks the very beginning of China's journalism education. The earlier journalism education focuses on the importance of newspaper education, the trainees of which are characterized as that of the practical, like craftsman, and the management model is also shaped by that of the American. Since the foundation of the new regime in 1949, China's journalism education has been greatly affected by the Soviet style for quite a considerable length of time before finding its own road for its development, which is clearly shown from the fact that there appeared a booming period for opening journalism schools. Disastrous to all, China's journalism education met its irrevocable destruction during the Cultural Revolution, yet it will be accepted if we take the premises that are destroyed into consideration. Its vitality is recovered with the opening-up. For the past 20 years, it has made remarkable progresses and breakthroughs owing to the guidance of the Party and the government, to the improved environment, especially to the hard work of thousands of press workers and teachers. As to China's journalism education itself, the involvement of political parties, groups and press media, individuals and the foreign journalist thoughts contributes a lot to its development. Its education demonstrates differently due to the patron organizations and the different historical stages. Yet, as far as the training model concerned, there is a transition from the comparative unitary model to the compound model to produce all-round talents on the basis of the integration between humanities and science. This transition from application orientation and knowledge and technique focuses to human-science basis and the academic, international competitiveness orientation marks the beginning of China's journalist talents' image in the world's journalist platform. Accordingly, it is essential for China's journalism education to take globalization path. This path is characterized as the reestablishment of training aims, reconstruction of the teaching material, building a qualified teaching staff of a higher academic level, taking a path prioritizing either on humanities or on science, expansion of international exchanges and cooperation. The development will be impossible without the support from the journalism studies, the improvement of the political, economic and humanity conditions, with specially the social and historical development offering its outcome. Only through a harmonious interaction and mutual support between journalism education and such factors, can it progresses with the time in its peculiar way in the internalization and globalization, so that in the context of China's accession to WTO, China's journalism education may work out wonderful talents for the world's press a nd furthermore to outpace the world's journalism education.",1024991142, 中国新闻教育流变论,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Xin JianLiJianXinLi, Xin Jian李建新", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711383041 , 70481942 , 189128 , H089617 , H089617", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国新闻教育流变论,2003,PQDT - Global,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024991142?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0745 Higher education"," 0391 Journalism , 0745 Higher education"," 0391 Journalism , 0745 Higher education",," 0391 Journalism , 0745 Higher education"," Journalism , Higher education"," (UMI)AAIH089617 , Communication and the arts , Education , 中国 , 传播 , 全球化 , 历史 , 新闻教育 , 科技 , 自由词",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+systematic+study+of+the+development+and+changes+of+China%27s++journalism+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Xin+Jian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3721,Urban water industry reformate of china,"Abstract Rencent years,after communication, civil aviation and bank industry, reformation of water industry began to effect. Especially after Chinese entry to WTO, the market of water industry gave access to social and foreign capital. Although the WTO items do not involve the issue of admission, this market do not exit the period of protection. Now the enterprises in water industry inevitably confront the whole international market, so the market is free from the regional monopoly. At present, the reformation of water industry is speeding up, and the process is very critical. But at the same time, we can find that the theoretical research is still at its earlier stage, and we have not gotten an explicit cognition. Through the research and analysis of the present reformation mode, we referred to the history and experiences of developing water industry in developed countries, and summarized the thoughts and measures in the development of reformation and the prospect in the article. At first, we introduced the status quo of water industry and the domestic and foreign background of reformation. We indulged to make the readers acquaint with the malpractice in systems and industrial structures. Then we tried to make the readers realize the international competitive circumstances and make certain the imminent and essential characters of reformation. After that, we introduced the reformation mode of water industry and analyzed the characters of different modes. We also investigated the different practices and successful experiences and pointed out the existent and potential problems. As a result, we found out the thoughts and measures of reformation. Then, for the success of reformation and favorable movement, we initialized the selection of reformation modes.

Not only do demographic trends underscore such a demand, but also extensive research documents the cognitive, social and emotional developmental benefits of high quality integrated provision in early childhood while at the same time contributing to countries’ ability to compete in a global economy (Eming-Young, 2002). This thesis is concerned with an analysis of the feasibility of transferring the English Early Excellence Centres (EEC) Programme to early childhood settings in Greece. The EEC Programme was introduced by the English Government in 1997 to develop and promote models of high quality integrated education and care services for young children and families as an important part of Government’s broad based strategy for increasing opportunities, supporting families, reducing social exclusion, increasing the health of the nation and addressing child poverty. Case studies were constructed at three Early Excellence Centres (EECs) in England - and two key policy makers involved in the programme were also interviewed. The analysis of the interviews, questionnaires and documents collected during the research in England provided useful insights into the development of integrated services at practice and policy level, along with the successes and challenges encountered during the process of change. Further exploratory case study research took place in Greece to examine whether there is the potential and desire to move towards integration. The theory of a ‘tipping point’ (Gladwell, 2000) provided some profoundly suggestive arguments and insights to analyse the processes by which the English EEC Programme developed at policy level, and how it ‘crossed a threshold’, tipped and spread nationally and internationally. In addition, this theory offered a practical thinking tool for constructing a strategy towards integration in Greece. Analysis revealed that a change process towards integration is not easy to manage; is most productively seen as a social process that gradually unfolds over time; and which acknowledges the socio-economic, political and cultural context of each country. This research indicates that keeping our focus on the development of integration at ground level could be an effective starting point in Greece, -but the development and delivery of integrated services also needs local and central support. A strategy towards establishing integrated service provision in Greece needs to explore what already exists and start building on that; to support personal and professional development; to value the participation of parents; to promote research; and to influence policy. This thesis wishes to stimulate debate, to contribute to the limited Greek literature in the area of integrated early childhood services and to be of interest to policy makers and advocates who have the capacity to shape the direction of the early childhood system in Greece.",1796352693,,Dissertations & Theses," Krassa, PenelopeKrassaPenelopeKrassa, Penelope", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4088392051 , 105799222 , 101309 , U187812 , U187812 , http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/292/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796352693?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0515 Education, Education," http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/292/ , DXN074288 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+the+feasibility+of+transferring+the+english+early+excellence+centres+%28eec%29+programme+to+early+childhood+settings+in+greece&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Krassa%2C+Penelope&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3723,A cross-cultural analysis of the spatial distribution of international tourists in China,"This research focuses on the cross-cultural study of the spatial distribution of tourists (SDT) or international tourists (SDIT) within China. It encompasses two broad areas of knowledge base - cross-cultural and SDT. Many of the issues in these wide ranging, but overlapping, domains have developed separately and have as yet to be conceptualised and researched in a holistic and rigorous manner. This makes the holistic and behavioural perspective, as well as the scientific approach of this study, all the more novel. The societal context of this study tourism in China, adds more practical and theoretical interest to this research. Its diversified tourism resources provide one of the best places to carry out a cross-cultural spatial research. The conceptual framework has strengthened and reinforced the literature in two respects. First, the notion of SDT has been clarified, and it is suggested that it consists of three features of tourist movement - pattern, direction and intensity. Secondly, a factual 'cultural distance' variable, formed from cultural constructs, has been used to underpin the cross-cultural comparative framework in addition to commonly applied cultural proxies such as nationality. The whole research methodology was developed based upon these two notions, and was greatly enhanced by the use of the discrete choice approach (logistic regression models) by which the operational challenges faced when incorporating the behavioural elements into cross-cultural and spatial research were successfully resolved. The research findings do not entirely support the empirical evidence quoted in the cross- cultural SDT literature. The key findings of this research are that tourists prefer linear instead of circular travel within China; their movements are either vertical and/or horizontal; international gateway positions of Beijing and Shanghai have been confirmed, but that of Guangzhou is questioned. All the cultural related variables are significant in the SDIT, but cultural distance is more sensitive at expressing the differences in the SDIT than cultural proxies. There is no evidence suggesting that geographical distance is a primary factor in the SDIT. Some trip attributes, such as travel groups, as well as social economic variables, such as income levels, are confirmed as significant, but demographic characteristics such as age and gender show no significance in the cross-cultural SDIT within a destination country.",1838265210,,Dissertations & Theses," Bowden, JiaolanBowdenJiaolanBowden, Jiaolan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4246237691 , 108989852 , 189128 , 9781369315745 , 10183369 , 10183369", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003, 9781369315745, English, English,,2003,PQDT - Global,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1838265210?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation"," Asian Studies , Recreation"," (UMI)AAI10183369 , Social sciences , International tourism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+cross-cultural+analysis+of+the+spatial+distribution+of+international+tourists+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bowden%2C+Jiaolan&amp;isbn=9781369315745&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3724,"Artisans and the city:  a social history of Bristol's shoemakers and tailors, 1770-1800.

A global, philosophical and linguistic perspective is required to avoid the well-trodden path that not only leads to always already familiar frameworks but also perpetulates dichotomous thinking. The thesis is structured in three parts to explore each of these perspectives in turn. This distinctive approach is adopted firstly to permit new connections to be made between citizenship and migration, the citizen and the migrant, secondly to demonstrate the heterogeneity that exists between the citizen and the alien, and thirdly to explain the condition of the citizen as alien: alien by degrees. Part one, in order to build a bridge between the concrete and the abstract, develops an explanation of migration that draws attention to multiple levels of displacements and migrants without moving. This takes some weight of the concept of citizenship. The central idea that the meaning of migration is not limited or confined to conventional definitions of physical movement and social settlement, and that citizenship too is a linguistic as well as spatial and temporal phenomenon, is investigated in parts two and three, which complement each other in their examinations of how words relate to words in general, and metaphor, migration and citizenship in particular. The philosophical and linguistic exploration of citizenship treats words as citizens and migrants, and highlights the place of alien words as much as words about aliens. This alternative approach presents both migration and metaphor as movements and processes of displacement. It reveals the differences in the status and agency of migrant citizens involved in different types of movement, real and imagined, and shows that it is not only people who migrate. This leads to an understanding of the asymmetry between and within familiar oppositions, the real constraints that too often foreclose self-definition in non-oppositional terms, classifications resonant of citizen and alien, and the power of unfamiliar juxta/oppositions which serve to unsettle them.",301605869,,Dissertations & Theses," Hiley, C.HileyC.Hiley, C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760125991 , 44992541 , 101309 , U177925 , U177925", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301605869?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," DXN073223 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Alien+by+degrees%3A+a+philosophical+and+linguistic+exploration+of+citizenship.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hiley%2C+C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3726,"Modernity's children: generational change, identity and global citizenship in Japan.","This thesis attempts to identify and document a generational movement in the conception and creation of Japanese collective identity-to understand its precedents and consequences. From an examination of how Japan's early 20 th century agricultural majority saw themselves in the world around them throughout Japan's period of industrialisation, to understanding the social landscape and identities of some of Japan's contemporary youth, the thesis charts a generational movement away from the influence of the State and nation-builders, and towards a more self-determined collective imagination which puts the individual in charge of the creation of Japaneseness. In contrast to their elders, young people create a multi-cultural and inclusive Japanese identity which incorporates local and global diversity and establishes them as equal stakeholders in a world of many like-others. Through life stories, interviews, case studies and community ethnography, the thesis attempts to understand how this generational movement has occurred because of the changes that modernity has wrought on the local arenas of Japanese life-reorganising family and community systems and memberships, and altering the perception and definition of what it means to be socially and imaginatively ""mobile"". It is these local-level changes-rather than any 'top-down' 'globalising' or 'westernising' forces-that have most changed the concurrent creation of Japanese collective identity. For the younger generations of Japan and of other industrialised societies too, the previous generations' attempts to come to terms with these changes have left them with a comparative freedom to re-conceive the borders and boundaries of collective identity, and to incorporate their experience of local diversity into a template of diversity-acknowledging cultural and national identity.

A fundamental aspect of the study is a terminological consideration of the relative differences between Spanish modernismo and 'modernism' in English, highlighting cultural difference in the history of the modern movement.  Spanish modernism is usually taken to be equivalent to Art Nouveau, although the issue is more complex; here it will be implicitly accepted that threads of modernity extend from the gothic revival in Catalan bibliophile printing of the 1870s through to the Second Republic, although the course and context of modern typography and graphic design during this period was naturally affected by the turbulent social and political history of Spain.  The Spanish reaction to central European 'rationalism' was coloured by the consideration of what was appropriate to the 'Latin' character. Priority will be given to articulate practitioners, who wrote about what they did.  Where possible the words of the protagonists (including intellectuals, printers, typographers, publishers, linguists) are quoted.  Significant figures emerge, such as Eudald Canibell and Mauricio Amster, about whom little is known outside of Spain. Activity in graphic design is taken here as a cultural index of its context, reflecting waves of nationalist revival in Catalonia, as well as the political volatility of the Second Republic, in which artists and designers inevitably became entangled with ideological conflicts.  The use of design in printed propaganda during the Spanish Civil War is also examined, with priority being given to items that have not had their design previously analysed in any detail, such as Nationalist propaganda magazine of the Civil War.  These show a clear appropriation of avant-garde aesthetics, raising the question of whether style can be separated from ideology in modernism.  The thesis concludes with an examination of graphic design's role (under the direction of Josep Renau) in the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exhibition.",301641220,,Dissertations & Theses," Córdoba, P.CórdobaP.Córdoba, P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760566131 , 44989611 , 101309 , U215115 , U215115", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301641220?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," DXN100983 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Typography+and+graphic+design+in+Spain%3A+from+gothic+revival+to+avant-garde&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=C%C3%B3rdoba%2C+P.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3728,Insider/outsider:  Sargent Claude Johnson and the dynamics of race and locality.,"Sargent Claude Johnson did not conform to the identity of the African American artist.  Although he depicted the black American, responding to the ideals of the black aesthetic, he transcended the borders of Afro-America. Representing the African American as race-proud and dignified in the 1920s and 1930s Johnson positioned himself at the heart of the Harlem Renaissance.  However, his commitment to the institutions of San Francisco, and not Harlem, locates him outside this movement, and his reference to multicultural and international influences positions him beyond the confines of his racial identity. During the New Deal Johnson fostered a greater connection to San Francisco.  He won respect locally and was promoted to supervisor on San Francisco's most prestigious sculptural commissions.  His work was inspired by the Regionalism, Social Realism and European modernism that came from the San Francisco context, and he confined the black subject to his private works. After the Second World War Johnson flourished as an artist of San Francisco.  He was fully committed to the local art institutions.  As with his colleagues, he developed an eclectic style inspired by the variety of avant-garde international influences that were filtered through San Francisco.   His interest in 'arts for art's sake' culminated in this period and he favoured pure abstraction in his work. Viewing Johnson through the context of San Francisco broadens the conception of this artist.  It facilitates a discussion of the Afro-American influence on Johnson's aesthetic without the essentialising of his race, it enables San Francisco to be viewed as a significant inspiration on Johnson's artistic identity, and it allows Johnson to be viewed within the context of modernism.",301642600,,Dissertations & Theses," Bell, R.E.BellR.E.Bell, R.E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760311211 , 45026161 , 101309 , U185124 , U185124", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301642600?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," DXN080327 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Insider%2Foutsider%3A%C2%A0+Sargent+Claude+Johnson+and+the+dynamics+of+race+and+locality.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bell%2C+R.E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3729,Refugees in east africa: implecations for host state security: a critical re-conceptualisation of refugees and securtiy studies using empirical case studies in kenya and tanzania,"The refugee literature is replete with studies that examine the humanitarian problems of refugees.  The major focus of study in the past has been on the refugees as an individual victim rather than on the hosts.  The few available studies that focused on hosts were basically concerned with the social and economic and more recently environmental impact of hosting refugees.  Increasingly the presence and cross border movement of refugees is recognised by policy makers and analysts as constituting a security threat to the hosts.  Yet in spite of this, little systematic empirical research has been conducted on the nature and extent of the security threat posed by refugees on hosts.  This thesis aims at partly filling this gap.  This is possible because with the end of the Cold War, researchers in refugee studies have adopted a security/stability approach that focuses on the security impact of hosting refugees.  In addition, the re-conceptualisation of security by Critical Security theory has enabled the inclusion of non-military threats, including refugees, in the analysis of security. In part, this thesis examines how a non-security issue can be securitised through discursive and non-discursive techniques.  In this study, the role played by various actors - individuals, the state, regional and international organisations - in the securitisation of refugees, that is, in constructing and presenting refugees as a security threat is analysed. Through empirical evidence collected during a field trip in Kenya and Tanzania, this study shows that the presence and cross-border movement of refugees into Kenya and Tanzania constituted a security threat (real or imagined).  These threats could be seen in five possible areas:  (a) internationalisation of conflict as depicted by inter-state conflict, political and ethnic violence between refugees and conflict between refugees and host populations;  (b) militarisation of refugees and the insecurity arising thereof;  (c) increased levels of criminality;  (d) the influx of illicit weapons and (e) environmental destruction.  When and why a refugee was considered a threat was influenced by the size of the flow nature of the flow that is civilian/military character of the flow;  militarisation of refugee camps and populations;  ethnic composition of the refugees;  relationship between sending and hosting states;  and xenophobic feeling exhibited to refugees.",301649522,,Dissertations & Theses," Mogire, Edward OmariMogireOmariEdwardMogire, Edward Omari", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760156101 , 45000531 , 101309 , U178690 , U178690", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301649522?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0616 International law, International law," (UMI)AAIU178690 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Refugees+in+east+africa%3A+implecations+for+host+state+security%3A+a+critical+re-conceptualisation+of+refugees+and+securtiy+studies+using+empirical+case+studies+in+kenya+and+tanzania&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mogire%2C+Edward+Omari&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3730,"Nationalism, gender and cultural identities: the case of Estonian art from the impact of modernity to the post-Soviet era 1850-2000.","Critical use of the representational regimes of nationalism is characteristic of early and mid-1990s' Estonian art, which was influenced by rapid changes in the social, political and cultural structures of the newly independent nation-state. In particular, those artistic practices informed by feminism have been engaged with a project of 'deconstructing' the signs and symbols of national femininity and nation-as-a-woman, thus, drawing attention to the functionality of women's images in representing the nation.  Both the history of Estonian art and of visual culture offer a whole repository of different images of the feminine, which index the debates around national identity, national femininity, and national art. The first crucial moment for these debates was the period of the nineteenth-century national awakening when national folkloric imagery was used together with a gradual symbolisation of the images of historical leaders of the national movement. The period of anterbellum independence is characterised by a particular dynamics of the modern and of the national. This relationship was also translated into art and art criticism, thus, articulating different visions of national or international femininity. The Soviet era with its often contradictory and simulations use of national rhetoric and policies of assimilation has contributed towards the solidification of nationalist discourses and, especially, their gender ideology. Traditional constructions of femininity as opposed to a new construct of 'Soviet Estonian woman' were often interpreted as a backbone of Estonian identity, the development which also was expressed in practices and interpretations of art. Critical and feminist art of the 1990s has continued to pay attention to all of these historical forms and developments of visualising-the-nation, and attempts to reveal their ideological content.  Without denying the emotional power of national(ist) identifications, the feminist critique of representation draws attention to the ambiguous nature of nationalism and also seeks to represent the memories and experiences, which have been suppressed by official nationalist discourses.",301656680,,Dissertations & Theses," Kivimaa, K.KivimaaK.Kivimaa, K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760163171 , 44957601 , 101309 , U177969 , U177969", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301656680?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," DXN074094 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nationalism%2C+gender+and+cultural+identities%3A+the+case+of+Estonian+art+from+the+impact+of+modernity+to+the+post-Soviet+era+1850-2000.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kivimaa%2C+K.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3731,Embodied visions:  the Op art work of Bridget Riley 1961-65.

To this end, the thesis is divided into six chapters covering respectively science;  visual perception and drug culture;  the notion of 'Britishness' and national identity issues;  the use made of Riley's paintings and related images in the fashion industries and the impart of this on contemporary assessments of her work;  the relationship of Riley's work to the performance art of the period, and how it might relate to Michael Fried's notion of 'theatre' in art;  Riley's position as a woman artist and the implications of this for the reception of her work.  Riley's work can be related to contemporary concerns with violence in cultural production, with fears and hopes for the future of Western societies, and to the changing social position of women within those societies.  Throughout, I argue that the various physical effects that critics claimed to experience when looking at Riley's work were central to very different interpretations of the work.  I suggest that Riley's work challenged prevailing modernist ideals of a cerebral aesthetic and constituted an appeal to recognise the importance of the body in the experience of art.  Her work can be related to the claims of French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty that painting is a bodily act and that the body must be understood not 'as a chunk of space or a bundle of functions but that body which is an intertwining of vision and movement'.",301680360,,Dissertations & Theses," Follin, F.M.FollinF.M.Follin, F.M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760163491 , 45003031 , 101309 , U173620 , U173620", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301680360?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," DXN070375 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Embodied+visions%3A%C2%A0+the+Op+art+work+of+Bridget+Riley+1961-65.+%28BL%3A+DXN070375%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Follin%2C+F.M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3732,"National cinema, world stage: A history of Hungary's sound film industry, 1929–1944","This dissertation investigates the origins and evolution of the Hungarian film industry, from the debut of sound film in Hungary in 1929 to the abrupt demise of Hungarian film making following the German occupation in March 1944. It considers how the “national” was a driving force behind and the desired aesthetic outcome of mainstream filmic practices. During this fifteen-year period, Hungary's film industry made advances unparalleled in Europe. Feature-film output, non-existent in 1929, increased rapidly. By 1942 Hungary was the continent's third most prolific film making state, trailing only Nazi Germany and Italy. This rise inspired Hungary's small film establishment and some of its ruling elites to dream of regaining the prestige and power lost in the post-World War I settlements which truncated Hungary. The dissertation explains why, despite these successes, the self-declared goal of Hungary's film establishment—to create a national industry that would beget a characteristically national style—was ultimately doomed to fail. The dissertation proceeds chronologically but is constructed around thematically organized chapters. Drawing primarily from Hungarian, German, and U.S. government archival sources, film trade magazines, and period films, it considers the role of the state in the creation, expansion, and regulation of the film industry. It examines disputes among various segments of Hungary's film profession, including those between producers, exhibitors, and distributors, as well as those between private professional associations and state-endorsed organs. It analyzes the various incarnations of the “Jewish Question” and how anti-Semitism and populism radically altered the shape of the industry. It discusses how national film production was tied to the dominant intellectual, political, social, economic, and ideological discourses occurring in interwar Hungary. It details the roles that transnational movements of capital, motion picture professionals, and ideas played in transforming the Hungarian film industry and its products. It considers how geopolitics and war affected the film industry's fortunes as Hungary sought a strategic cinematographic niche between the dominance of Hollywood and the demands of Nazi Germany.",304335360,,Dissertations & Theses," Frey, David StephenFreyStephenDavidFrey, David Stephen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764896341 , 30187821 , 66569 , 3104801 , 3104801", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304335360?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0900 Motion Pictures",," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0900 Motion Pictures"," European history , History , Motion Pictures"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Cinema , Germany , Hungary , Jewish , Sound film industry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=National+cinema%2C+world+stage%3A+A+history+of+Hungary%27s%0Asound+film+industry%2C+1929%E2%80%931944&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Frey%2C+David+Stephen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3733,"Cycles of protest: Contentious collective Puerto Rican action, 1960s–1980s","By using social movement theory, especially political opportunity structure (POS) framework, this dissertation examines its effectiveness in the quasi-colonial context using the empirical case of Puerto Rican contentious collective action (protest demonstrations, strikes, and armed actions), from 1960s to the 1980s. This dissertation makes a case that international political opportunity and constraint must be analyzed adjacent to national political opportunity structures along with more permanent structures (i.e., the quasi-colonial structure) when examining contention in this setting. This is largely based on the different relationships between states and citizens. Since the Puerto Rican government does not have national authority or autonomy (but limited internal authority within the political framework of the U.S.), Puerto Rican contentious action does not follow the patterns experienced in nation-state types of countries. This dissertation analyzes the long-term historical trends and processes that have structured Puerto Rican contention (such as the U.S. quasi-state formation program in Puerto Rico, its geopolitical location, and its history of the anti-colonial/nationalist grievances and struggle). By illustrating how contentious action has been structured in the pre-cycle period, this study than situates the political and socioeconomic conditions alongside the mobilization and demobilization phases of the different categories of contentions within this protest cycle in order to evaluate the dimensions of the POS model. The findings suggest that although the POS framework has explanatory power in understanding the relationship between the political environment and the generation and decline of contentious action (i.e., why there were moments of contentious action in some historical periods and not in others), there are shortcomings in this model, in regards to how permanent structures have shaped Puerto Rican contentious action. It is from within this quasi-colonial structure, we see the role of external influences (international opportunity/constraint), the continuation of anti-colonial/nationalist grievances and struggle, blocked access to national affairs, the embedded continuous structure of repression and repressive conditions (e.g., U.S. military presence and police surveillance/harassment), and how all these factors help us understand the differences between the Puerto Rican protest cycle and the protest cycles in nation-states.",304748146,,Dissertations & Theses," Montes, VinceMontesVinceMontes, Vince", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765030601 , 30214061 , 66569 , 3109769 , 3109769", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304748146?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science",," 0626 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," Sociology , Latin American history , Political science"," Social sciences , Nationalism , Protest , Puerto Rican , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cycles+of+protest%3A++Contentious+collective+Puerto+Rican+action%2C+1960s%E2%80%931980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Montes%2C+Vince&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3734,Visual splendors and intellectual games: Heritage as an international film genre,"This dissertation argues for scholarly recognition of a range of British, American and international films of the last three decades—most of them literary adaptations of classical literature, almost all based on highly literary screenplays and set in the near past (approximately eighteenth century to World War II)—as a vital genre called “heritage.” Whether literary-inspired (e.g., Howards End ) or arising from original screenplays (e.g., Gosford Park ), these movies share a thematic preoccupation with class and gender identity and a visual emphasis on historical accuracy in the recreation of the past. The development and reception of the heritage genre stands as a dynamic illustration of key tendencies not only in today's cinema, but also in contemporary culture, which I address over five chapters. Chapter One discusses heritage's role in the ongoing blurring of boundaries between art and commercial filmmaking and analyzes the desire for authorship manifest at all levels of the creative process, from production to criticism, notwithstanding a simultaneous gradual disintegration of directorial authority. Chapter Two explores the audience's perception of this body of films as a coherent genre category. Chapter Three considers the recurring interest in intertextual correlations between word and image that I demonstrate also constituted the artistic trademark of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Chapters Four and Five focus on how international heritage films communicate a postmodern awareness of the instability of gender, class, racial and national identities and of the limits of representation. The study proposes that a combination of richly detailed visuals and sound and the central narrative perspective of an intellectual outsider observer, puzzling out social relations, best characterize heritage cinema. The genre realizes an arguably feminine aesthetic sensibility, along with feminist themes that contribute to a prevalent ideology of “thoughtful” liberalism. Moreover, in replacing the female body with images of nature highly evocative of maternal plenitude, these films shift away from standard gratification of male visual pleasure. I argue in conclusion that in addressing generally human fantasies of regression, heritage films satisfy female spectatorial pleasure alongside, but not in opposition to, that of film theory's projected male spectator.",304776224,,Dissertations & Theses," Patriche, AlinaPatricheAlinaPatriche, Alina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765094121 , 30203111 , 66569 , 3111626 , 3111626", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304776224?accountid=14496," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Motion Pictures",," 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," British and Irish literature , Motion Pictures"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Adaptation , Film , Genre , Heritage",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visual+splendors+and+intellectual+games%3A++Heritage+as+an+international+film+genre&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patriche%2C+Alina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3735,Hazardous waste transportation: An overview,"Increasing industrialization and globalization has spawned the unprecedented generation of environmental toxic and hazardous wastes. The existence of publicly known hazardous waste problems such as toxic spills, and river pollution that pose serious and very real threats to human health puts extensive pressure on the government to take an aggressive role in hazardous waste control and transportation. The main objective of hazardous waste transportation is public safety. Each government has the responsibility to ensure that hazardous materials should be transported safely for the social and economic good of the country. Hazardous waste management is now a major and urgent global concern. Various techniques, models, and guidelines for the perception of risks associated with the transport of the hazardous materials are developed. Database of the accident data are developed by transportation agencies to be used for the development of models to improve safety of hazardous waste transportation. Based on the available risk perception models, accident models, the type of hazardous material, origin/destination, and the availability of emergency response routes for their transport are properly designed. Advanced technologies, automated vehicle location system (AVL) and geographical information system (GIS) are also used for the analysis and modeling for the safe transport of hazardous materials. The purpose of this project is to present a literature review of hazardous waste materials and their impact on human health, regulations to control the movement of hazardous materials, Basel Convention and its effectiveness, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials, model developments for risk perception and management and the use of advanced technologies for safe transportation of hazardous wastes.

Tremendous complexity inheres in such collaborations. They reflect increasingly global issues and concerns. What makes such collaborations possible, gives them life, meaning, and helps them thrive in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles? Interfaith movements represent one of the greatest challenges to collaboration, given the millennia-old entrenchment in violent religious conflict. The United Religions Initiative (URI), a global, chaordic, interfaith alliance dedicated to ending religiously motivated violence, is chosen as the research setting for that reason. Collaborative Capacity (CC) is introduced as an integrative theoretical framework. The ten constructs of the CC Framework, developed through an extensive trans-disciplinary review of the inter-entity collaboration literature, are proposed as being generic to such collaborations and applicable at multiple levels of analysis. The CC Framework is then explored and applied at multiple levels of analysis through a virtual appreciative inquiry process in this multiple case-study involving eight URI “cooperation circles” on four continents, chosen to maximize their diversity on the ten CC constructs. Qualitative and quantitative analyses provide strong, consistent evidence for a basic distinction among the eight cases: those that are more informally structured and internally focused, and those that are more formally structured and externally focused. This spectrum of diverse forms, ranging from informal virtual groups to formal national non-profits, is made possible through the URIs innovative chaordic design. That design provides an effective—though challenging—structure for global, grassroots interfaith organizing, at least among these eight cases. Overall, the inner/outer foci among the cases reflect the greater inner focus of the URI principles and the greater outer focus of its action agenda. Those foci seem to express the URIs own complex challenge of building collaboration. What gives life and meaning to these diverse URI collaborations? Through application of the CC Framework, three key factors emerge: purpose, principles, and relationships—and all three center around relationships. Within the URI and possibly beyond, Collaborative Capacity is about that most fundamental of human social concerns: being respectfully, caringly, and deeply related. Perhaps it is ultimately about developing the relational organization.",305222440,,Dissertations & Theses," Fitzgerald, Stephen PaulFitzgeraldPaulStephenFitzgerald, Stephen Paul", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765241411 , 30762811 , 66569 , 9780493979717 , 0493979719 , 3077445 , 3077445", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003," 9780493979717 , 0493979719", English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305222440?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology"," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology"," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology",," 0700 Social structure , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology"," Social structure , Management , Occupational psychology , Religion , Alliances , Initiatives , Studies"," Social sciences , Psychology , Collaborative capacity , Interfaith , Transorganizational collaboration , United Religions Initiative",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+collaborative+capacity+in+a+global+chaordic%0Aalliance%3A+The+United+Religions+Initiative&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fitzgerald%2C+Stephen+Paul&amp;isbn=9780493979717&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3737,"Vers l'avenir. Québec women's politics between 1945 and 1967: Feminist, maternalist and nationalist links","This thesis examines the actions and ideologies of seven Québec women's associations between 1945 and 1967: l'Association des femmes diplômées des universités de Montréal, l'Association des femmes de carrière du Québec métropolitain, le Cercle des femmes journalistes, l'Association canadienne des consommateurs, la Fédération nationale des femmes libérales du Canada (Québec section), les Cercles d'économie domestique and l'Union catholique des femmes rurales . During this period, they worked to expose a number of injustices experienced by women, with little ideological consensus: some were feminist calling for the acquisition of individual rights for women, participation in politics and economic independence while others were maternalist wishing to enhance women's public roles on the basis of their maternal capacities. At the same time, the organizations articulated a variety of nationalist views regarding the role of women in the modernization processes of the 1950s and the 1960s societal-wide transformations of the Quiet Revolution. In the first chapter of the thesis, the concepts of feminism, maternalism and nationalism are delineated to situate them within historiography. The second chapter outlines the structures of the seven organizations. The third and fourth chapters reveal the groups' activities before 1960 and the demand for a provincial interventionist state to guarantee women's legal, social and economic citizenship rights. Four issues are explored in detail: educational rights, employment opportunities, social provisions and reforms to the Civil Code in the area of marriage laws. The fifth chapter looks at the nationalist aspirations of the associations and their participation in the processes of nation building. Some supported neo-nationalism hoping to include women in the future Québec nation-state, others clung to the tenets of traditional nationalism while the remainder envisioned the nation within a pan-Canadian frame of reference. At this time, the groups were able to meld their feminist or maternalist ideologies with their nationalism believing that the rights of women coincided with those of the collective. Chapters six and seven explore the thoughts of the organizations after 1960. A number of changes in their discourses from the fifties were noticeable. An ideological convergence appeared as the groups turned to liberal, equality feminism. Influenced by the international discourse on human rights, they demanded women's individuality and freedom of choice to work outside the home or remain with their families. At this point, their feminism clashed with the nationalism of the Quiet Revolution that continued to confine women to their biological functions. These contradictions were further reinforced by two major events. First, was the formation of two umbrella groups, la Fédération des femmes du Québec and l'Association féminine d'éducation et d'action sociale , which united feminists in the province. Second, Expo 1967 proved to be an important occasion for women from around the world to meet and discuss their rights. These events led most of the groups to put aside their Québec nationalist views and join Canadian feminists in presenting their demands to the Royal Commission on the Status of Women. For Québec feminists the federal inquiry did not signal the beginning of a second wave of the women's movement, rather it represented a new phase in their continuous quest for equality. In conclusion, this thesis reveals how the seven associations played an active role in defining and shaping Québec society alter the Second World War.",305226008,,Dissertations & Theses," Gosselin, Cheryl A.GosselinA.CherylGosselin, Cheryl A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764751031 , 30220001 , 66569 , 9780612827325 , 0612827321 , NQ82732 , NQ82732", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003," 9780612827325 , 0612827321", English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305226008?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies",," 0334 Canadian history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," Canadian history , Political science , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Feminist , Maternalist , Nationalist , Politics , Quebec , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Vers+l%27avenir.+Qu%C3%A9bec+women%27s+politics+between+1945%0Aand+1967%3A++Feminist%2C+maternalist+and+nationalist+links&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gosselin%2C+Cheryl+A.&amp;isbn=9780612827325&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3738,"Living with bad surroundings: War and existential uncertainty in Acholiland, northern Uganda","War has ravaged Acholiland in northern Uganda since 1986. The Ugandan army is fighting a rebel insurgency group called the Lord's Resistance Movement/Army. The study describes a brutal pattern of war, as it unfolds from historical material as well as from informants' contemporary stories, collected during three phases of fieldwork from 1997 to 2002. Several themes are brought up for discussion, such as the imperial inheritance and contested political history; the discrepancy between the rebels' violent insurgency practices and their written manifestos; the army's counterinsurgency tactics and internal mass displacement; and the role of rumours, cosmology, religion and morality in war. The study acknowledges today's global interconnectedness. Traders in war machinery have considerably fuelled the war. In addition, structural adjustment programmes and humanitarian aid become entangled with local socio-political realities. The study explores the various ways people in Acholiland struggle to establish control and balance in quotidian life in a situation of ongoing civil war. While it has been postulated that some cultures or ethnic groups in essence are more prone to war than others, it is argued here that this is not a fruitful way of analysing cultural life. Rather, as the ethnography of the study shows, cultural life is a means by which people both engage and to comprehend existentially the realities of war and violence, and also struggle continuously to build hope for the future. This makes culturally informed practices the main means through which war and its effects are interpreted and acted upon, something that sustains people in their experience of war in social life, making war and its multiple forms of violence routines among other routines in everyday life. At the same time, the study discusses the informants' distress about the fixation of meaning to a limited set of cultural and ethnic stereotypes that propaganda of war and chauvinistic politics impose upon the local moral world and the national order of things. Guiding tools throughout the study are the Acholi concepts of piny marac and piny maber : “bad surroundings” and “good surroundings.”",305243547,,Dissertations & Theses," Finnstrom, Olof SverkerFinnstromSverkerOlofFinnstrom, Olof Sverker", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764640791 , 29923411 , 66569 , 9789155457471 , 9155457479 , C815165 , C815165", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003," 9789155457471 , 9155457479", English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305243547?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Acholiland , Bad surroundings , Existential uncertainty , Uganda , War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Living+with+bad+surroundings%3A+War+and+existential+uncertainty+in+Acholiland%2C+northern+Uganda&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Finnstrom%2C+Olof+Sverker&amp;isbn=9789155457471&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3739,"Potatisriket: Stora Bjurum 1857–1917 Jorden, makten samhället","To the people on Sweden's big landed estates, the period 1857–1917 was an epoch of changes. The first two decades were in many ways a golden age for the landlords. Agricultural prices were high, wages low, and formal and informal political power still directly related to the land ownership. After 1880 these conditions rapidly changed. Grain prices fell due to increased international competition. Wages rose due to emigration and industrialisation. The democratisation process soon threatened the landowners politically. After the turn of the century, the growing labour-movement questioned their legitimacy and called for expropriating the big estates and redistributing the land. The present thesis deals with one Swedish estate-community during this period: Stora Bjurum in west-central Sweden. The goal is to offer an in-depth study over a limited area, covering a wide range of issues: geographic conditions, production, organisation of labour, social structure and local culture. The focus, however, is on political development. How does a community work where one person has virtually all means of power? How did the master use power and for what purposes? What could the apparently so powerless subjects do to assert themselves and their interests? How did all this change during the eventful period 1857–1917? A key concept in the study on inegalitarian societies is paternalism . This thesis elaborates a model to analyze the political mechanism of paternalistic community from the tensions between power and counter power, solidarity and conflict , and omnipotence and righteousness . It also shows how the masters' use of power changed over the time studied. Confronted with a harder competition of labour and the spread of ideas about democracy and social equality, the harsh and omnipotent rule of the early period no longer worked. The master now searched more to integrate the workers within the estate community. He also increasingly legitimized his own power through a paternalistic ideology stressing the good and mutual relationships between ruler and ruled. The subjects, however, also used this ideology, turning their masters' claims of righteousness into their own demands for better working conditions. This way, under the surface of a maintained monopoly of power, the subjects gradually strengthened their position.",305244836,,Dissertations & Theses," Nystrom, Lars VidorNystromVidorLarsNystrom, Lars Vidor", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764609501 , 29924871 , 66569 , 9789188614438 , 9188614433 , C812238 , C812238", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003," 9789188614438 , 9188614433", Swedish, Swedish,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305244836?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics"," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics"," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics",," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics"," Political science , European history , Labor economics"," Social sciences , Community , Farm mechanisation , Labour movement , Land , Paternalism , Power , Stora Bjurum Estate , Sweden",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Potatisriket%3A++Stora+Bjurum+1857%E2%80%931917+Jorden%2C+makten%0Asamh%C3%A4llet&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nystrom%2C+Lars+Vidor&amp;isbn=9789188614438&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3740,"Nature as the foundation to heal and reconnect mind, body, soul and emotions in urban elementary schools: The use of visualization and art in building and creating soulful classrooms","The state of education in the western world has reached a state of soullessness. The post-industrial technological culture has resulted in a brain-based educational system where children are disconnected from their whole beings. Mind, body, soul and emotions form the fundamental aspects of self and without nourishing that complexity in the classroom, children have become alienated from their souls. In urban environments, children have become estranged from their connection with the earth. Disconnection from soul and earth are connected together and require understanding and action. To heal this disconnection, nature-based guided imagery practices or visualizations and free, unstructured art-based expressions can reconnect children to their sense and understanding of the interconnectedness of all things in the universe.

To do so, an investigation into Paul's socio-economic status is undertaken. It is determined that Paul was among the social elite of his day and that his trade as a leatherworker was instrumental in achieving success as a cross-cultural itinerant evangelist. Second, an examination of Paul's theological and practical orientation for mission is carried out. It is deduced that Paul's ultimate aim in mission was doxological through church planting which led to social transformation. Third, the rationale for Pauline orthopraxy in Christian mission is articulated. It is argued that the church should emulate Paul's methodology in cross-cultural mission in light of the logical, historical, strategic, theological, biblical and missiological evidence. Fourth, an analysis of the manner in which the Jerusalem, Antiochene and Gentile churches shared resources in the first century is set forth. It is shown that there were a number of purposes for which this was done. Particularly, in reference to the Gentile collection project, it is concluded that Paul's goal was the conversion of Israel by means of demonstrating the Gentile church's indebtedness to the Jerusalem church. And last, a critical assessment of the International Partnership Movement (IPM) is provided. In this section, a description of the IPM is given, the debate over the IPM is presented, and a dialogue with the IPM is pursued. In the end, missional partnerships between the Western and non-Western church are judged to be inherently problematic for historical, anthropological and missiological reasons. As such, if the missio Dei is to move forward unhindered among the multitude of human cultures in the twenty-first century then it will do so when the church engaged in cross-cultural mission adheres to mission in the way of Paul by developing local resources, overcoming the dependency syndrome, and emphasizing localization instead of globalization.",305273646,,Dissertations & Theses," Little, Christopher R.LittleR.ChristopherLittle, Christopher R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765653161 , 30204291 , 66569 , 3087148 , 3087148", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305273646?accountid=14496," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology"," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology"," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology",," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology"," Bible , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Christian , Cross-cultural , Mission , Paul, Saint , Saint Paul , Special reference",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mission+in+the+way+of+Paul%3A++With+special+reference+to+twenty+-first+century+Christian++*mission&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Little%2C+Christopher+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3742,"Low -income progressive men: Microcredit, gender empowerment, and the redefinition of manhood in rural Bangladesh","This study researches how low-income rural men can become stakeholders in gender empowerment programs in Bangladesh. Changing gender roles have been extensively researched in Bangladesh; the focus, however, has been exclusively on women. But poor women cannot exercise full agency unless their male relatives also change their attitudes and conduct. Clearly, ways in which men can also change their attitudes and practices should be explored in international development studies and implemented in poverty alleviation programs. This dissertation directly addresses this need by investigating three inter-related objectives: (1) the meaning of quality-of-life indicators or empowerment outcomes to the villagers themselves; (2) villagers' perspectives on gender roles and practices; (3) pathways to empowerment for men and women. Twelve domains ranging from investment in fatherhood to gender wage equity are used to investigate the objectives of this multimethod qualitative study. The sample of seventy-three villagers comprises women who are microcredit loanees of the Grameen Bank and Uttaran (a local Non Governmental Organization) and their male relatives. Minority Hindu and Rishi (untouchable) families as well as Muslim families were included. Rural proverbs and songs were used as part of the grounded theory technique to explore indigenous meanings of empowerment and gender roles and practices. The findings reveal that women expect caring and commitment from their husbands; they want a sharing marriage. Good husbands make decisions about household finances with their wives and respect their reproductive roles. Such men are more empowered than those who abuse their wives and can act as social change agents. Villagers define empowerment outcomes as financial security, individual dignity, peace in the household, and justice in rural institutions. They use five pathways to attain these outcomes: (1) reframing masculinity; (2) leveraging kinship; (3) uniting women; (4) joining village institutions; and (5) earning income through microcredit. The study's model shows how economic, gender, political, legal, and community factors interweave with individual differences and minority status to impact empowerment goals. Policy recommendations emphasize how to include men in gender-and-development programs and how the state, microcredit institutions, and women's movement can work together to empower rural men and women and their communities.",305274790,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahmed, Fauzia ErfanAhmedErfanFauziaAhmed, Fauzia Erfan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765874761 , 31004841 , 66569 , 3090040 , 3090040", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305274790?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0453 Womens studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Womens studies , Cultural anthropology , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology"," Social sciences , Bangladesh , Gender empowerment , Low-income , Manhood , Microcredit , Rural culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Low+-income+progressive+men%3A++Microcredit%2C+gender+empowerment%2C+and+the+redefinition+of+manhood+in+rural+Bangladesh&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Fauzia+Erfan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3743,"Unconquered nations, unconquered women: Native women (re)mapping race, gender, and nation","In this dissertation I ask how American Indian women intellectuals have actively engaged in the movement for representational, intellectual, and political sovereignty. How have they, individually and collectively, determined the context in which their history emerged? I contend that by examining conceptions of space through the trope of mapping in the writing of Native women from the beginning of the twentieth century to the contemporary, patterns emerge which engage with a history of spatial restructuring in the Americas. By beginning at the same time as the “closing of the frontier” and continuing to current conceptions of globalization, I examine how Native women conceptualize borders, nations, and place. In their work, Native women (re)map race, gender, and nation demarcated through the historical, political, and social construction of space. I begin with E. Pauline Johnson's conception of space and its intersection with the production of nation. I examine the ways in which the use of spatial metaphors, particularly those of civilization, progress, and frontier, was an important aspect of creating national subjects. I continue with Silko's uses of language to draw a new map of the Americas in her book Almanac of the Dead to create new associations with borders and nation-states. “Healing the Scars of Colonization: Linda Hogan's Solar Storms,” I look at Hogan's use of the bildungsroman to narrate the production of a community in a colonized space that is in danger of being flooded as a result of Hydro-Quebec Project in Canada. I continue addressing the path of spatial reconstruction as a process of settler-colonialism in, “From the Stomp Grounds On Up: Joy Harjo and the Politics of Globalization.” I contend that Harjo's poetry provides new conceptions of space in global restructuring where the particular is more than just descriptive, but is politically vital and humanly necessary.",305292713,,Dissertations & Theses," Goeman, Mishuana R.GoemanR.MishuanaGoeman, Mishuana R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764895511 , 30186531 , 66569 , 3104230 , 3104230", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305292713?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American literature , American studies , Womens studies , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , E.

I trace the emergence of and transformations in activism in the English profession's various subcultures as they responded to the corporate state's ideology and practices in a thirty-year period spanning the Sputnik “crisis,” 1960s protest movements, the post-1968 counterrevolution in the '70s and Reagan '80s, and the neoliberal globalization of capital. Unlike existing institutional histories, my project historicizes the profession's left and its discourses about itself. To contextualize its rise, I first investigate efforts by members of the profession in the late 1950s and early 1960s to lobby Congress for funding on the grounds that improved English education could strengthen the U.S. corporate state against communism. I then show that the academic left's discourses since the 1960s have revealed a persistent, and often self-conscious, struggle with the ideology of an increasingly corporatized profession and with the very legacy of '60s campus activism. I locate the academic leftist's conflicted identity (as institutional professional versus “street” activist) in the internal debates of the anti-Vietnam War teach-in movement, in disciplinary critiques, and in the manifestos and correspondence of the New University Conference, the leftist academic group whose protests at MLA '68 resulted in the MLA Radical Caucus. The profession's campaign against “doublespeak” following Watergate and left literary scholars' assessments of their power under Reaganism disclosed their anxiety about the efficacy of the Foucauldian specific intellectual, as critics often paradoxically caricatured '60s activism while appropriating its tropes to bolster the force of their oppositional rhetoric. I suggest that many progressives in the profession have had difficulty attempting broad-based collective action partly because changes in the academic workplace enervated political action in public spheres, whose symptoms I read in the narratives of labor alienation and exploitation of increasingly adjunctified writing teachers. Solidarity was discouraged by the gender and class segmentation of labor and by the ideologies of upward mobility and privatization that intensified in a profession and managed university re-structured under global capitalism.",305299868,,Dissertations & Theses," Jehn, Thomas RobertJehnRobertThomasJehn, Thomas Robert", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765334031 , 30425331 , 66569 , 3083078 , 3083078", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305299868?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science , 0340 Educational sociology"," 0337 American history , 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science , 0340 Educational sociology"," 0337 American history , 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science , 0340 Educational sociology",," 0337 American history , 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science , 0340 Educational sociology"," American history , American literature , Political science , Educational sociology"," Social sciences , Education , Language, literature and linguistics , Academic activism , Cold War , Dissent , English , New world economic order , Power , Profession",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Academic+activism%3A++Conceptions+of+power+and+dissent+in+the+English+profession%2C+from+the+Cold+War+to+the+new+world+economic+order&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jehn%2C+Thomas+Robert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3745,Modes of motion: Travel in the nonfiction narratives of twentieth-century American women writers,"Twentieth-century American women's nonfiction displays an abiding preoccupation with movement as a strategy for achieving agency and change. “Modes of Motion” traces this preoccupation through the final decades of the travel era to the end of the century, juxtaposing travel narratives produced by Edith Wharton, Jessie Redmon Fauset, Katherine Anne Porter, and Mary McCarthy with contemporary personal essays written by, respectively, Joan Didion, Alice Walker, Dorothy Allison, and Mary Gordon. Wharton, Fauset, Porter, and McCarthy used travel abroad to insert themselves into a literary tradition that was enormously popular during the early twentieth century. In their travel narratives, they adopt the perspective of the mobile cultural outsider, using it to construct the meaning of foreign places and simultaneously to redefine their relationships to “home.” The waning popularity of the travel book, the rise of global tourism, and the social and political upheavals of the 1960s have fueled a more direct engagement with U.S. society in contemporary American women's nonfiction. While the earlier writers explore concepts of difference and “otherness” as they relate to foreign landscapes, Didion, Walker, Allison, and Gordon address their experiences of marginalization and alienation within familiar American environments. Like their precursors, they use movement to establish vantage points from which to assess, critique, and redefine their relationships to their societies, yet in place of travel they engage in various alternative modes of motion to achieve their goals. Chapter I compares Wharton's strategies for acquiring authority in her early travel books with Didion's postmodern textual vacillations in Slouching Toward Bethlehem and The White Album . Chapter II juxtaposes Fauset's search for “home” in her travel essays with Walker's process of internal boundary crossing in In Search of Our Mother's Gardens and Living By the Word . Chapter III explores how Porter positions herself within a geographical and cultural “borderland” in her travel essays and how Allison achieves a similar effect through her metaphorical “excavation” of confining sociopolitical categories in Skin and Two or Three Things I Know for Sure . Chapter IV compares McCarthy's development of her authoritative vision through travel in Europe with Gordon's intellectual development in Seeing Through Places .",305306234,,Dissertations & Theses," Donahue, Maryann RosellaDonahueRosellaMaryannDonahue, Maryann Rosella", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765185041 , 30409891 , 66569 , 3079192 , 3079192", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305306234?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Nonfiction , Travel , Travel narratives , Twentieth century , Women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Modes+of+motion%3A+Travel+in+the+nonfiction+narratives+of+twentieth-century+American+women+writers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Donahue%2C+Maryann+Rosella&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3746,"Progress and popular democracy on the southwestern frontier: Middle Tennessee, 1790–1824","Political evolution on the Tennessee frontier was complex and contested during the early national period. During the region's territorial phase (1790–1796) a miniscule population and the governing features of the Northwest Ordinance ensured that a small clique of speculators would maintain control over government institutions. These early leaders used land accumulation to establish themselves, and ruled without challenge because no mechanism existed for ordinary settlers to question their authority. At the turn of the nineteenth century, however, a burst of contested militia elections allowed ordinary Tennesseans to obtain positions of community importance. They also fed into a nascent public sphere that gave Tennesseeans a precedent for political opposition. Soon the elite found they would have to construct broad constituencies in an increasingly contested popular democracy. This shifting political culture coincided with economic and demographic developments that altered Middle Tennessee's social institutions. Between 1796 and 1801 the population grew two hundred percent, and by 1815 there were 292,590 residents committed to cotton and tobacco planting, and land speculation. Commercial agriculture in turn created a mercantile class that integrated Middle Tennessee into a global economy. By the 1820s, commerce and planting had become so profitable that local entrepreneurs stood at the forefront of the Southern movement for economic innovation. Yet competition associated with an expansive economy created unforeseen popular divisions. Even as planting and merchant interests looked to the government to expedite commercial growth, ordinary farmers believed that excessive debt threatened their stability. They therefore contested more expansive definitions of progress. This dissertation examines the intersection of a changing political culture with an emerging economy. It underscores that a democratic political culture emerged because of militia electioneering and demographic growth, and that divisions over commercial expansion were in place before the antebellum period. But it also shows that rapid development undermined Indian cultural and economic prerogatives, and restricted Tennessee's slave and free black population. Studying the intersection of political culture and economy in early national Middle Tennessee, in other words, clarifies the ways in which various members of a Southern community defined and came to grips with the question of “progress.”",305311802,,Dissertations & Theses," Ray, Kristofer MarshallRayMarshallKristoferRay, Kristofer Marshall", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765644941 , 30215671 , 66569 , 3086608 , 3086608", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305311802?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Early national period , Frontier , Popular democracy , Progress , Tennessee",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Progress+and+popular+democracy+on+the+southwestern+frontier%3A%0AMiddle+Tennessee%2C+1790%E2%80%931824&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ray%2C+Kristofer+Marshall&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3747,"Mainstreaming gender: South Korean women's civic alliances and institutional strategies, 1987–2002","This thesis explores the interrelationship between gender equality and “Third Wave” democratization, focusing on South Korea. While scholars have focused predominantly on Latin America and Eastern Europe, my study highlights the less studied East Asian experience. Specifically, I argue that the Korean case constitutes an important litmus test for the transformatory potential of nascent democracies. Whereas political democratization in other regions coincided with economic crises that disproportionately impacted women, Korean women's political activism occurred within the context of robust economic growth during the first decade of democracy (1987–97). Accordingly, the state had greater resources than Latin American administrations to devote to non-economic policy areas and gender-friendly social policies. Moreover, because of the general success of Korea's democratic reforms, we could expect women would benefit more directly from democratization than their international counterparts. I develop a theoretical model that (i) analyzes how the political opportunity structure of democratization-particularly changes in political institutions and actor constellations—influences efforts to advance gender equality, and more specifically, (ii) explores how the institutional and organizational contexts of Korean women's post-transitional activism have facilitated or constrained struggles to increase women's political representation, establish governmental women's machineries and affect gender-specific policy changes. I conclude firstly that it is important to de-center women's movements and consider the broader array of actor constellations, progressive and conservative, involved in contesting gender politics. Korean efforts to promote gender equality were facilitated by women's organizations' collaborative relations with the progressive civic movement, as well as the absence of strong institutional carriers of conservative values. Despite a Confucian-influenced political culture, the dearth of cooperative ties among Korean economic and cultural conservatives has minimized the impact of a conservative backlash. Second, moving beyond explanations of “institutional inertia”, a disaggregated approach to post-transitional changes at the political institutional level, revealed other key sources of variance. The activist Constitutional Court and ironically Korea's inchoate, non-ideological party system proved most conducive to promoting various types of gender rights. Lastly, a hybrid women's movement, represented by two umbrella organizations, enabled feminist activists to maximize these political opportunities and gain respect as legitimate actors in formal political negotiations.",305312515,,Dissertations & Theses," Jones, Nicola AnneJonesAnneNicolaJones, Nicola Anne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765094711 , 30210511 , 66569 , 3112035 , 3112035", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305312515?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0332 History"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0332 History"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0332 History",," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0332 History"," Political science , Womens studies , History"," Social sciences , Civic alliances , Gender , Institutional strategies , Korean , Mainstreaming , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mainstreaming+gender%3A++South+Korean+women%27s+civic+alliances%0Aand+institutional+strategies%2C+1987%E2%80%932002&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Nicola+Anne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3748,Casting shadows: Dalit assertion in Indian literature,"This dissertation tracks the emergence of literary narratives by and about Dalit communities in India from the 1950s to the 1990s. Examining the literary texts from a historical materialist perspective, I explore their articulation of self-identity and resistance against the caste system. The materialist methodology enables discussion of the literature's focus on labor and the body, while centrally posing the problematic of emancipation. I begin with a look at a trend in recent postcolonial scholarship that views western, post-Enlightenment, progressive discourses as entirely complicit in the excesses of colonization. I argue that while the devastation caused in India by colonialism is undeniable, the alignment of western political radicalism with the appropriating logic of imperial conquest by some postcolonial theorists, in particular, those from the Subaltern Studies project, may have led to a lack of engagement with anti-caste movements led by Dalits in the colonial period, which were rooted in modern, rights-based, egalitarian conceptions of human citizenship. When Dalit history is acknowledged, binaries of indigenous/western and Same/Other necessarily implode. I propose instead that Dalit transgressions approached both the colonizer and the high Hindu ethos in canny pathways, negotiating cultural spaces that drew from western radical ideologies, while re-crafting alternative religious identities in Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism. I also identify what appears to be a wrench between Dalit politics and literary expression. While the political arena seeks a resolute Dalit subjectivity and looks to a hopeful future, the literature often destabilizes the subject through a predominant emphasis on loss. This emphasis could, on the one hand, be seen as a negation of the possibility of progress. On the other hand, however, the literature also continues to present visions of a recuperable future without reverting to simple triumphalism, instead, interrogating the marks of power on “broken” Dalit subjects. Dalit literature has expressed much of the anxiety, desire, and pain of a century of caste struggle, and the creative visions of social justice put forward by writers of the Dalit condition can continue to inspire and shape the consciousness of local and transnational participants, in battles against oppressive and exploitative systems.",305313986,,Dissertations & Theses," Ramachandran, ShaliniRamachandranShaliniRamachandran, Shalini", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765023291 , 30424451 , 66569 , 3108403 , 3108403", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305313986?accountid=14496, 0305 Asian literature, 0305 Asian literature, 0305 Asian literature,, 0305 Asian literature, Asian literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Caste , Dalit , India , Untouchables",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Casting+shadows%3A++Dalit+assertion+in+Indian+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ramachandran%2C+Shalini&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3749,"Mission to moralize: Slaves, Africans, and missionaries in the French colonies, 1815–1852","The global expansion of France during the nineteenth century is one of the most significant phenomena in modern French history. It was animated by an official creed, referred to as the “ mission civilisatrice ” or “mission to civilize,” that established boundaries for what the French government would and would not do in the colonies. At the same time that the French empire was expanding, a religious revival was underway. It spawned a Catholic missionary movement that made France the most significant missionary-sending nation of the nineteenth century. Despite the magnitude of this movement, no studies have been made of the specifically Catholic interpretation of and contribution to the French doctrine of colonial expansion—the “mission to civilize.” This study attempts to connect the missionary revival with French colonial expansion by focusing upon the issue that first bound together the religious and political conceptions of France's modern mission abroad—slavery—in the places where debate over its abolition was the locus of social and cultural contention: the colonies of Guadeloupe, Guyane, Martinique, Réunion (Bourbon until 1848), and Sénégal from 1815 to 1852. Whereas, early in the nineteenth century, Catholic missionaries to the French colonies worked mainly with European colonists, by the 1830s and throughout the 1840s they increasingly came to work with the slave population. Although often opposed to slavery in principle, its abolition was far from a pressing concern for most missionaries. Of much greater interest was the extension of primary education, vocational training, and religious instruction to slaves themselves-an endeavor that missionaries described as the “moralization” of the slave population and which they considered a fundamental necessity before the abolition of slavery could be successfully accomplished. The French government seized upon the financial support of missionary “moralization” as a means by which to give the appearance of assisting the abolitionist cause while in fact continuing to encourage its delay. Colonial administrators came to rely upon missionary “moralization” to the extent that, following the revolutionary abolition of slavery in 1848, a new republican government increased its support for missionaries. An attendant increase in religious participation by the former slave population buttressed Catholic arguments for the efficacy of religion as a civilizing force. The Catholic “mission to moralize” among the slaves of the French colonies created an interdependance with the French government so that the national “mission to civilize” ultimately borrowed much of its content from its religious counterpart.",305316149,,Dissertations & Theses," Feay, Troy ErnestFeayErnestTroyFeay, Troy Ernest", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765988181 , 30996651 , 66569 , 3094676 , 3094676", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305316149?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history"," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history"," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history",," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history"," European history , Black history , Religious congregations , Latin American history , African history"," Social sciences , Africans , Colonies , French , Missionaries , Moralize , Slaves",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mission+to+moralize%3A+Slaves%2C+Africans%2C+and+missionaries+in%0Athe+French+colonies%2C+1815%E2%80%931852&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feay%2C+Troy+Ernest&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3750,Borderland identities and contemporary Spanish fiction,"During the post-Franco period, national borders have constituted a subject of great debate in Spain. The country's reorganization into a state of autonomies in 1978 officially recognized distinct national entities within Spain while contentious negotiation over the extension and the limits of sovereignty has ensued until the present. Spain's membership in the European Union in 1986, emblematic of its newly established democracy and participation in the global marketplace, further transformed the nation's boundaries. Tensions mark the centripetal-centrifugal battle of globalization, as local or national concerns vie for advantage and supra-national alliances promote their interests. Although in theory the EU and globalization open up national borders to unrestricted movement of goods, capital, and people, in practice certain migrations are highly regulated and restricted. This is certainly the case for non-EU members and, particularly, for people from less developed nations. Nonetheless, Spain has seen a dramatic increase in immigration from areas with economic and political strife. These various border realignments and crossings have a profound impact on constructions of national and local community, ethnicity, and individual identity. My dissertation examines border crossings and borderlands created by these diverse political and social phenomena as imagined in contemporary Spanish fiction. Viewing literature as cultural practice, I read narratives, from the 1980s, 1990s, and the present decade, of Carme Riera (“Letra de ángel” and “Mon semblable, mon frère,” Contra el amor en compañía y otros relatos ), Suso de Toro ( Calzados Lola and No Vuelvas ), Cristina Fernández Cubas ( El año de Gracia and “La flor de España,” El ángulo del horror ), and Lourdes Ortiz (“Fátima de los naufragios” and “La piel de Marcelinda,” Fátima de los naufragios ) as engaging in critical dialogues with dominant political policies. I take a cultural studies approach, drawing on anthropological, sociological, and historical sources and contemporary theory to illuminate my analyses of these fictional texts. Notions of postcolonial identity, borderland situations, and hybridity inform my work. I give unique application to these ideas, usually discussed in the context of former colonized nations, as I ground my writing in the particularity of borderlands and narratives of post-totalitarian Spain, a former colonizer.",305322734,,Dissertations & Theses," Leone, Maryanne L.LeoneL.MaryanneLeone, Maryanne L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 790227661 , 30171321 , 66569 , 3141479 , 3141479", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305322734?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Motion Pictures",," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," Romance literature , Motion Pictures"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Borderland , Fiction , Identities , Spanish",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Borderland+identities+and+contemporary+Spanish+fiction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leone%2C+Maryanne+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3751,"The firm of Greeley, Weed, and Seward: New York partisanship and the press, 1840–1860","The firm of Greeley, Weed, and Seward led a revolution in political communications by promoting causes, parties, and candidates beyond the conventions of the second party system. Between 1840 and 1860, the firm championed economic policies built on free labor and free soil by advancing the agendas of the Whig and Republican parties. Greeley, Weed, and Seward led opposition to Jacksonian Democrats in the press and positions of elected power by organizing national interests that outlived regional competitors and survived the trials of war. New Yorkers Horace Greeley, Thurlow Weed, and William H. Seward pioneered tactics commonly used by modern campaign strategists to reach the maximum number of voters, yet historians rarely recognize their role in founding a new political order. The firm effectively rallied a diverse network that was part of a national movement toward democratization, thereby popularizing electoral politics in the United States. Greeley, editor of The New York Tribune, was recognized popularly as the firm's leader because he provided his newspaper, a leading penny press publication, as a mouthpiece for social transformation. Weed, boss of the Whig Party in New York, provided the political capital needed to back the firm's projects. And Seward, a statesman of national and international repute, represented the firm and its constituents as a high-ranking Whig and Republican official. This dissertation provides an account of the firm between the famous “Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too” campaign and the election of Abraham Lincoln. It cites the publications, letters, and manuscripts of Greeley, Weed, Seward, and their associates to shed new light on previous interpretations of Whig and Republican policy. The study analyzes the role of the firm in the creation of the third party system and features the creation of a discourse among members of a representative democracy. It reveals the historic importance of the press—in particular, a three-member media-based institution—in determining the success or failure of political agendas and campaigns.",305324244,,Dissertations & Theses," Borchard, Gregory AlanBorchardAlanGregoryBorchard, Gregory Alan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764735021 , 29914271 , 66569 , 3096596 , 3096596", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305324244?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," 0391 Journalism , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," 0391 Journalism , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science",," 0391 Journalism , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," Journalism , American history , Political science"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Greeley, Weed, and Seward , New York , Partisanship , Press , Republican Party , Whig Party",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+firm+of+Greeley%2C+Weed%2C+and+Seward%3A++New+York+partisanship%0Aand+the+press%2C+1840%E2%80%931860&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Borchard%2C+Gregory+Alan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3752,Crossing the berm: The Disney theme park as sacralized space,"This dissertation proposes that the Disney theme park be approached as an agent of ritualization in the creation and experience of sacralized space: an ordered, organized space for the thoughtful, selective construction of social meaning and the mutual exercise of symbolic power, initiated in the creation of environment and experienced through ritualized activities and spatial movement, resulting in the recovery of the past and the possibility of a transformed future.

Such an examination of Disney theme parks hopefully will provide a broad ground on which to place in dialogue the other interpretive proposals within contemporary Disney thought, a basis for the thoughtful discussion of these sites within Religious Studies, as well as a more flexible and coherent method of newly considering the complexity of the parks and their pervading influence, for good or for ill, on the global cultural stage.",305328710,,Dissertations & Theses," Newcomb, ChrisNewcombChrisNewcomb, Chris", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 775147881 , 29913621 , 66569 , 3137463 , 3137463", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305328710?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion,, 0318 Religion, Religion," Philosophy, religion and theology , Disney theme park , Ritualization , Sacralized space",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crossing+the+berm%3A++The+Disney+theme+park+as+sacralized+space&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Newcomb%2C+Chris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3753,"“The greatest single threat”: A study of the Black Panther Party, 1966–1971","This dissertation, “The greatest single threat,” takes its title from a 1970 declaration by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover who concluded that the Black Panther Party represented the “greatest threat to the internal security” of the United States. Founded in October 1966, by two college students Huey Percy Newton and Bobby G. Seale, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (BPP) advocated defensive action against aggressive hostile forces throughout local black communities namely, the police. Newton and Seale also drafted a political platform addressing fundamental needs of black communities nationwide including freedom, education, employment, economic and social justice which they termed the Ten Point Platform and Program. Although the BPP dropped self defense from its name in 1968, it drew the attention of the federal government which instituted counterintelligence efforts (COINTELPRO) to neutralize and discredit the organization. This dissertation investigates the activities of the BPP at the local and national level to expose some of its strengths and weaknesses. It is primarily an examination of the Oakland Chapter which served as the national headquarters of the BPP. It also examines and appraises other chapters to determine direct and indirect effects of internal and external factors on the BPP's leadership and membership. The research is based on oral interviews, letters, police records, newspapers, leaflets, posters, photographs, biographical and autobiographical accounts and FBI files. The primary questions are: what made the BPP so “threatening?” and to whom did the organization pose the “greatest single threat?” The main argument of this dissertation is that the BPP engaged in a “revolution” whose overall significance and impact have been overlooked. This dissertation explores recurrent themes of “revolution and revolutionary” throughout the BPP's literature. It argues that the interchangeability of both terms by both the BPP and scholars of the BPP has enshrouded the BPP in a series of political “isms” that have dominated the historiography of the BPP. Little attention has been focused on how individual BPP leaders and members defined and applied “revolution” and “revolutionary” based on location, class and gender. Examining such themes exposes geographical differences in overall interpretations of the terms which account for some of the internal dissension in the BPP at both the national, local and international level. This dissertation will show that by engaging in particular activities throughout its history, the BPP posed a “threat” to the United States government because it challenged and demanded that fundamental tenets of American democracy be enforced throughout local black communities. This study fills an important gap in the historiography of radical movements throughout American history by exposing strengths and weaknesses of perhaps the most radical organization during the civil rights era. This dissertation departs from traditional studies of the BPP which have primarily focused on COINTELPRO efforts in explaining the demise of the BPP and exposes the BPP's principal role in its own demise through pertinent internal dissension between individual leaders and rank and file members.",305329389,,Dissertations & Theses," Thevenin, Rose CarineTheveninCarineRoseThevenin, Rose Carine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765894531 , 30205141 , 66569 , 3092217 , 3092217", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305329389?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history"," 0615 Political science , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history"," 0615 Political science , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history",," 0615 Political science , 0337 American history , 0328 Black history"," Political science , American history , Black history"," Social sciences , Black Panther Party , COINTELPRO , Civil rights , Radicalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CThe+greatest+single+threat%E2%80%9D%3A++A+study+of+the+Black+Panther+Party%2C+1966%E2%80%931971&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thevenin%2C+Rose+Carine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3754,"Mobilizing for global justice: Social movement organization involvement in three contentious episodes, 1999–2001","This dissertation tests four theories (grievance-based outsider, resource mobilization, cooptation, and affinity) to explain differential involvement of social movement organizations (SMOs) across three contentious episodes. The first episode occurred in Seattle, Washington in the Fall of 1999 to oppose the latest round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks being held there. A second episode opposing the policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank occurred in Washington, D.C. in April of 2000. The third episode also focused on the policies of the IMF and World Bank and was scheduled for the end of September 2001 in Washington, D.C. However, it was cancelled just weeks beforehand as a result of the September 11 th terrorist attacks. Participant observation, survey, interview and archival data were employed in this project. Data were collected in two-stages: (1) a sample frame was constructed from protest event flyers and calendars from each episode generating a list of 1388 U.S. organizations; and (2) a stratified random sample was drawn of 215 organizations in which surveys were sent via e-mail and U.S. postal mail to 204 SMOs with available contact information. In all, 141 respondents returned the surveys for a response rate of 69%. Central findings from this dissertation are that resource mobilization is the strongest indicator of SMO “role prominence” and involvement in core role capacities as sponsors and organizers (e.g., revenue, formalization, and professionalization are related to increased involvement). Decision-making style had no effect on involvement. Furthermore, proximity of organizational headquarters to a protest episode increased involvement in central organizing roles, undermining the outsider thesis.

In literature, film, and journalistic accounts they grappled with the German situation, offering their own diagnoses and suggesting possible avenues for recovery. Through an examination of literary and cinematic texts created between 1945 and 1951, my dissertation traces the rise of a discourse of the “German Patient,” and argues that postwar culture frequently weighed the nation's suffering against concepts of collective guilt. In my analysis of works by Karl Jaspers, Wolfgang Staudte, Thomas Mann, and Peter Lorre, I show that the preoccupation with national health commonly associated with the Nazi period in fact persisted well into the postwar years. Adopting metaphors of disease, intellectuals after 1945 represented Germany as an ailing nation, beset by a collective illness brought on by fascism. Writers and filmmakers attempted to formulate a medical history of the recent past and its roots, and to make clear the need for collective recuperation. They portrayed National Socialism in terms of a virulent force, and suggested that the horrors of the past twelve years were signs of a massive social “infection.” Following critic Susan Sontag and historian Antoine de Baecque, among others, I argue that these discussions helped to reconceive German identity through the rejection of fascism as an unhealthy movement. In their will to cleanse the nation of its Nazi traces, however, many of these thinkers employed a rhetoric that bore a troubling resemblance to fascist ideology. I demonstrate the continued presence of a language of hygiene in postwar constructions of the nation. At the same time, I contend that postwar culture embraced a genuine idealism, not uncharacteristic for Germany, regarding the restorative potential of art to heal collective wounds. Believing that art could bring about regeneration, the writers and thinkers whom I examine contributed to the formation of a new national narrative. They inverted the Nazi concept of a healthy Germany, and instead posited a nation united in illness and struggling toward recovery.",305338258,,Dissertations & Theses," Kapczynski, Jennifer MayKapczynskiMayJenniferKapczynski, Jennifer May", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764945241 , 30181781 , 66569 , 3105261 , 3105261", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305338258?accountid=14496," 0311 Germanic literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0900 Motion Pictures",," 0311 Germanic literature , 0900 Motion Pictures"," Germanic literature , Motion Pictures"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Film , German , Jaspers, Karl , Karl Jaspers , Lorre, Peter , Mann, Thomas , Metaphors , National illness , Peter Lorre , Postwar , Staudte, Wolfgang , Thomas Mann , Wolfgang Staudte",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+German+patient%3A++Metaphors+of+national+illness+in+postwar+literature+and+film&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kapczynski%2C+Jennifer+May&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3756,Certifying forests and factories: The emergence of private systems for regulating labor and environmental conditions,"Private, non-governmental programs for certifying companies as environmentally or socially responsible emerged in the 1990s in response to problems of sweatshops in the global apparel industry and deforestation in the forest products industry. The similarity between certification programs in each field is striking but has received little attention to date. Neither pure self-regulation nor traditional public regulation, certification programs embody a type of “private regulation by information.” Why did this same regulatory form emerge in these two very different fields? Theories focusing on consumer demand, the globalization of production, threats of state intervention, and cultural diffusion all fall short of explaining the emergence of certification systems in both the apparel and forest products fields. This dissertation develops an integrated institutional approach to the emergence of certification systems, focusing on three dimensions of institutional emergence—political, organizational, and cultural. This approach calls for careful attention to historical process, macro-meso linkages, institutional embeddedness, and the dynamics of political contestation—with particular emphasis on the place of social movements in organizational fields. The project uses a comparative case study methodology, drawing on data from 37 in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the creation of certification programs, comprehensive content-coding of four trade journals from 1987–2000, and some archival and secondary materials. An analysis of the political processes through which certification associations initially emerged reveals two important factors—social movement campaigns that targeted companies and a neo-liberal institutional context. These led states, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and some companies to build or support private certification programs, and foreclosed some other options. An analysis of organizational founding shows how dynamics of innovation and challenge produced multiple certification programs competing for legitimacy in each field. The cultural aspect of institutional emergence is captured through an analysis of how the meanings of certification and monitoring changed over time in the industry discourse, as these practices got theorized and re-framed by a variety of actors. By utilizing an integrated institutional approach, this research illuminates the interactions of macro-level changes (like globalization) and the concrete actors (institutional entrepreneurs) that produced certification initiatives.",305339478,,Dissertations & Theses," Bartley, Timothy WilliamBartleyWilliamTimothyBartley, Timothy William", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764952661 , 30180631 , 66569 , 3106968 , 3106968", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305339478?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations , 0344 Social research"," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations , 0344 Social research"," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations , 0344 Social research",," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations , 0344 Social research"," Sociology , Labor relations , Social research"," Social sciences , Corporate social responsibility , Environmental conditions , Factories , Forests , Labor conditions , Private , Regulation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Certifying+forests+and+factories%3A++The+emergence+of+private+systems+for+regulating+labor+and+environmental+conditions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bartley%2C+Timothy+William&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3757,"Policing the border: Politics and place in the work of Miguel Méndez, Marisela Norte, and Leslie Marmon Silko","In Policing the Border, I argue that Miguel Méndez' 1974 novel Peregrinos de Aztlán , Marisela Norte's 1991 spoken word piece “Act of the Faithless,” and Leslie Marmon Silko's 1991 novel Almanac of the Dead refocus the discussion of illegality by shifting the reader's/listener's gaze from the bodies of border crossers and border dwellers to the cross-border movement of global capitalism and capitalist exploitation. Policing the Border shows that these texts expose the ways in which the U.S. nation-state and its concomitant ideological apparatuses focus upon brown bodies beyond or crossing the border, and work in tandem with capitalist structures of exploitation. These texts not only seek to make the U.S. nation-state and capitalism's international crimes on the border more visible, but they also denounce these crimes. The complex representation of the relationship between the geographical, material, social, and cultural entity of the border and capitalist exploitation provided by the writings of these border authors makes clear as well the critical links between knowledges about the border and their manipulation by both capital and resistance movements. On the one hand, Policing the Border attempts to open up the traditionally separate area of literary border studies to an interdisciplinary/inter-literary approach by reading two Chicana/o texts beside a Laguna Pueblo text. Too, each of the texts selected for this study shares particular features of fragmentation and ambiguity. Finally, each of these three texts also makes a call to memory, to the recording, re-construction, and preservation of the past—all pasts—as necessary to produce change for the better. These authors use art to question the policing gaze of state/capital and to suggest the deregulation of the border space that is home to workers on both sides of the legal border, even while calling for a counter-policing. Policing the Border sets out to demonstrate that there are and have been powerful texts written by people of color in the U.S. that re-narrate, deconstruct, and re-remember the dominant notions and histories that facilitate the very coercive and policing structures of the U.S.-Mexico border, by using art as a cultural weapon against historical structures of dominance, oppression, repression, and exploitation—that is, by using art to “police” the border. Finally, Policing the Border participates in and brings together conversations in all fields of study that seek to question the categories of citizen, nation, the border, and America. I show how these three texts imagine and narrate an alternative understanding of what America means and where its borders lie. Policing the Border points to the many insights and analyses provided by the cultural production of three writers from marginalized communities who theorize and historicize the other side of America and the American dream.",305339988,,Dissertations & Theses," Pritchard, Demian LeePritchardLeeDemianPritchard, Demian Lee", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765889311 , 30248491 , 66569 , 3091318 , 3091318", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305339988?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0591 American literature , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American literature , American studies , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Border , Mendez M., Miguel , Mexico , Norte, Marisela , Place , Politics , Silko, Leslie Marmon , United States-Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Policing+the+border%3A+Politics+and+place+in+the+work+of+Miguel+M%C3%A9ndez%2C+Marisela+Norte%2C+and+Leslie+Marmon+Silko&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pritchard%2C+Demian+Lee&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3758,Leveraging accountability: How freedom of information brought courts into governance in Japan,"Political entrepreneurs promoted freedom of information ( jōhō kōkai ) ordinances at the local level in Japan beginning in 1980, and these statutes had become widespread by 1990 because of their popularity with voters, even though politicians had little information about how courts would interpret the ordinances. By 1995, Japanese courts had overruled many local government decisions to withhold information and had established a substantial body of precedent favorable to plaintiffs. Favorable court decisions, in turn, led to a mobilization of groups committed to using litigation and a sudden increase in freedom of information and taxpayer litigation in the late 1990s. Courts and court-like procedures have become increasingly important checks on democratic governments over the past 40 years. Japan should logically resist this trend toward “judicialization” because of its centralized, bureaucratic judiciary; its cohesive, autonomous bureaucracy; and longstanding single party rule. But in certain areas Japan has judicialized. Explanations of judicial intervention in governing have focused on political officials' need to control more powerful bureaucracies, litigation-based social movements' attempts to achieve policy goals, and increasing global flows of goods and knowledge as forces for convergence to a more legalistic mode of state-society relations. In Japan, however, administrative law specialists, not political officials, designed procedural statutes such as the Information Disclosure Act and Administrative Procedure Act. Court intervention has been the result not of a top-down concern for control but rather of a bottom-up campaign to use courts to hold government accountable. Through freedom of information and taxpayer litigation, courts have constrained government and redefined the mode of resolving state-society conflict. In administrative procedure, by contrast, courts and formal procedures initially promised to play similar roles but have failed to do so. Lower barriers to potential litigants under information disclosure and taxpayer suit statutes provided an opportunity for court intervention in governance. Nevertheless, the key reason for the different role of courts is that freedom of information and taxpayer suits enjoyed a network of interest groups willing and able to litigate, while few businesses were willing to pursue administrative procedure claims in court.",305341477,,Dissertations & Theses," Marshall, Jonathan DavidMarshallDavidJonathanMarshall, Jonathan David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765345291 , 30181851 , 66569 , 3121596 , 3121596", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305341477?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0398 Law"," 0615 Political science , 0398 Law"," 0615 Political science , 0398 Law",," 0615 Political science , 0398 Law"," Political science , Law"," Social sciences , Accountability , Courts , Freedom of information , Governance , Japan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Leveraging+accountability%3A+How+freedom+of+information+brought+courts+into+governance+in+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marshall%2C+Jonathan+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3759,"Gender, space, and power: A cross -cultural perspective","This research is a journey through the subjective experiences of men and women in low-income households in three cities across the world: Phoenix, London, and New Delhi. It examines the gendered nature of spaces in their housing, how this is understood differently in different cultures, and, hence, interpreted as “masculine” or “feminine.” It examines the feelings of belonging that are rooted to real or imaginary places, and how this is related to identity formations of particular social groups. Through the personal narratives and experiences of the urban poor in these three cities, this research examines concepts of spatial segregation, representational spaces, human agency, and the production of geographic inequalities. It thus deconstructs generalized sociospatial theories and practices and highlights their complexity by presupposing a different “politics of location” in which to articulate resistance. The ethnographic studies of public housing in these three cities find that safety and crime are the prime concerns of women everywhere. Yet, space is perceived differently from different gender, age, race, and ethnic positions. In all three cities, spatial narratives and practices construct powerful ideologies through which masculinity and femininity are understood. The architects and planners along with the local authorities are also involved in an image-making process, where the poor are housed behind middle-class facades to remove the very signs of poverty. Yet, there were both subtle and obvious expressions of human agency in all three cities, where users reorganized space to suit their values, beliefs, identities, and ideologies. From local narratives, the research moves to a more global analysis of discourses on economic growth, sustainable communities, and regeneration of neighborhoods. It indicates how spatial practices and the environmentalist and feminist movements have been hijacked for capital accumulation. It discusses how nation-states, local authorities, planners, policy makers, and architects use claims to objectivity and moral order to valorize certain social groups while condemning others. As seen in this research, it is always the poor, the marginalized, and the “others” who pay the price in the production of space for economic gains.",305341992,,Dissertations & Theses," Datta, AyonaDattaAyonaDatta, Ayona", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765375221 , 30181601 , 66569 , 3084611 , 3084611", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305341992?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0453 Womens studies , 0366 Geography"," 0729 Architecture , 0453 Womens studies , 0366 Geography"," 0729 Architecture , 0453 Womens studies , 0366 Geography",," 0729 Architecture , 0453 Womens studies , 0366 Geography"," Architecture , Womens studies , Geography"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Arizona , Cross-cultural , England , Gender , Housing , India , Power , Space , Urban poor",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gender%2C+space%2C+and+power%3A+A+cross+-cultural+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Datta%2C+Ayona&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3760,"Citizens or workers? The politics of *education in northeast Brazil, 1959–1964","This dissertation analyzes and compares four educational reform projects implemented in the Northeast Brazilian state of Pernambuco during the short tumultuous period of popular coalition government immediately preceding the military coup of 1964. Case studies include the Movimento de Cultura Popular (MCP), sponsored by the populist municipal government of Recife; the Promoção Agnes, a program jointly run by a local missionary school and the Pernambuco state government; the Superintendência do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste (SUDENE), the federal government's regional development agency; and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). With varying degrees of sincerity, these projects aimed to make good on the federal government's pledge of universal access to education, a right enshrined in the nation's constitution since 1824. This was no easy task. In 1959 there were 80,000 children between the ages of 7 and 14 in Recife that were without access to schooling and adult illiteracy was estimated to be 70 percent. Integral to each of these reform initiatives was a particular conception of what role education should play in the ordering of the social, economic and political reality. These conceptions are made evident in their founding charters, guiding plans and literacy books. Most importantly, these conceptions reflect larger trends and as such can help us to understand how these competing models of development interacted in other arenas as well. In this period Brazil's political and economic leadership was forced to choose between two contending models for how Brazil, and specifically the Northeast, should proceed, in terms of political and economic organization. Therefore, I address whether these education movements were primarily concerned with raising the popular sector's critical consciousness to create active citizens ( education for citizenship ), producing modern laborers for the emerging industrial sector ( education for development ), or simply appeasing the popular classes in order to maintain the status quo ( literacy for the status quo ). The underlying premise of the dissertation is the suggestion that through the lens of these educational reform initiatives we can expand our understanding of both the politics of development and the crisis of the populist state in 1950s and 1960s Northeast Brazil.",305345981,,Dissertations & Theses," Malkin-Fontecchio, Tia ElizabethMalkin-FontecchioElizabethTiaMalkin-Fontecchio, Tia Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765643911 , 31012231 , 66569 , 3087308 , 3087308", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305345981?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history"," Latin American history , Education history"," Social sciences , Education , Brazil , Citizens , Economic development , Education , Workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Citizens+or+workers%3F+The+politics+of++*education+in+northeast%0ABrazil%2C+1959%E2%80%931964&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malkin-Fontecchio%2C+Tia+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3761,An &lt;i&gt;ecologia-humana&lt;/i&gt;-based historical inquiry as a creative force for nation building: Toward an appreciative model of conversational co-creation of a nation's future,"This dissertation is about the role of language as a means and a tool: to grasp knowledge and understanding from history, to draw from it notions of possibilities, and to generate the formation of an image of a nation's future. The idea of conversational co-creation of a nation's future emerged from a historical inquiry through a human ecology perspective. This perspective explains population movement in relationship to a social role based on geography, current knowledge, available technology, and the human agency perceptions. (For instance, the geographical key function of bridging two bodies of water via the Panama Canal.) This perspective also provides reasons for population migration and crowding within a country, allowing the possibility of choice about future population distribution. Using Panama as a case study and based on an understanding of its history, it is possible to comprehend that Panama is at an age of paradigm shift and it is possible to understand what it means to have the leadership defined by the ‘law of the situation.’ This leadership will be driven by the collective image, will be responded to through the collective behavior, will provide a reason to exist at a society level, and will serve as the motivation to make the decisions that need to be made. It is through a conversational process in a group, that learning what it means to be Panamanian takes place and the awareness of what the role of Panama is at a global level is awakened. Conversations, with this ecologically defined historical framework, generate the image and are the basis for action since society is communication. The co-creation of the image itself forms the national identity, produces a sense of belonging and provides a purpose that transcends—all of these with and through language. The combined ecological understanding coming out of the collective space process, equips leaders with the needed knowledge to develop new ideas and the motivation to carry out present actions that will transform into reality what started as a common vision. The case study includes an analysis of what is communicated through themes at a society level.",305346820,,Dissertations & Theses," Ruiz Arauz, Maria ElisaRuiz ArauzElisaMariaRuiz Arauz, Maria Elisa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764739401 , 30246871 , 66569 , 3097360 , 3097360", Dissertation/Thesis, 2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305346820?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0336 Latin American history , 0366 Geography"," 0700 Social structure , 0336 Latin American history , 0366 Geography"," 0700 Social structure , 0336 Latin American history , 0366 Geography",," 0700 Social structure , 0336 Latin American history , 0366 Geography"," Social structure , Latin American history , Geography"," Social sciences , Conversational cocreation , Creative force , Ecologia-humana , Future , Nation-building , Panama",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+ecologia-humana-based+historical+inquiry%0Aas+a+creative+force+for+nation+building%3A++Toward+an+appreciative+model+of+conversational+co-creation+of+a+nation%27s+future&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ruiz+Arauz%2C+Maria+Elisa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3762,"Latino music, identity, and ethnicity: Two case studies","This dissertation concerns itself with the construction and examination of a “Latino” musical and ethnic identity in two ethnographic case studies for which fieldwork was conducted in Berkeley, California (September 2000–February 2001) and New York City (June 2001–February 2002). In the first case study of Berkeley-based Chilean musician, composer and exile Quique Cruz, I examine the construction of his identity along ethnic Chilean lines and emphasize the continuity of Quique's musical identity in exile and diaspora. By placing Quique within historical and musical/artistic contexts, I demonstrate his connection to specific critical moments, people, and institutions in Chilean history. I posit his musical life history as a “cultural document” that extends beyond the idiosyncratically personal to illuminate aspects of the relationship between the individual and culture. I conclude the first case study with an analysis of The Archeology of Memory: Dreaming; Darkness and the Body; After the Fire…Water (TAOM), a work based on Cruz's experience of imprisonment and torture in the Chilean military's concentration camps during the 1970s. TAOM centrally concerns itself with the relationship between art and terror. The second case study focuses on El Taller Latino Americano, a community arts center in New York City's Upper West Side. I examine the strategic and fluctuating use of a pan-ethnic, hybrid conception of “Latino” by the taller's musical community during a season of concert performances and recordings.

I conclude the second case study with the consideration of one of the taller's “regulars,” the renowned Peruvian guitarist Carlos Hayre, an important figure in Peruvian criollo and Afro-Peruvian folkloric music.

As forming the factor intricately, the range in the ascendant, popular of development trend involves the global new-type culture form, mass culture has already caused the extensive concern of Chinese and foreign scholars, The studying about it has already been launched in different disciplines, research of different angles and different aspects. Though the academia does not have a final conclusion to the essential intension of mass culture, yet at present there are different judgments on its social functions, and opinions vary to its development prospects. But, urgent need and historical mission of the socialist spiritual civilization developed on the basis of Chinese nation's advanced culture, there are positive theory and practice meanings in the analysis of the mass culture phenomenon to the contemporary Chinese society. In the western society, mass culture is not merely regarded as a kind of cultural life style dominated by culture industry, controlled for the commercial profit by cultural industry, and is often considered to be the cultural activity form set against with elite's culture and elegance culture. The western scholars hold the attitude of a kind of criticism to mass culture generally, among them regard criticism of the school of Frankfort as representatives particularly. The so-called "" mass culture "" of school of Frankfort, is the mass culture in the passive meaning, mainly refers in particular to depend on mass media technology, depend on living of the family and leisure, "" culture mixed sweetmeat "" that agitated the appreciation of art, politics , religious propaganda , philosophy idea and commercial profit , it is the mixtures of science and technology , economic base , ideology and cultural consumption, it is the important component or displaying the way in a totally new way of the modern capitalist commodity system. It has a partiality for the way concept and psychology of handling the masses of amusement with the leisure, cultivates and supports the consciousness of submitting to which rules, safeguards the current situation. Must is it say Frankfort society of school criticize theory point to the contemporary capitalist society mainly to come, it is a kind of culture to the developed industrial society in the west that is explained and criticized with culture. Undoubtedly, this kind of criticism is extremely deep, for us ,have reference function on analyzing contemporary Chinese mass culture scientifically. There are essential differences between Chinese mass culture and western mass culture. Chinese mass culture is after reform and opening-up, with the overall transition of the social structure of our country and brand-new culture phenomenon appearing in sound development of market economy, have extremely deep traditional culture inside information and extremely clear advanced cultural direction at the same time. According to Chinese great mission and essential request that Chinese culture develop of revival of nationhood, Chinese mass culture should be participated in and accepted voluntarily actively by most members of society of our country, have national characters ,accord with spirit of the times , rich science intension , for masses' culture life design loved by all, it must have a national characteristic , scientific and three major characteristics of popularization concurrently at the same time , must reflect it under the socialist market economy condition accurately , the practical experience of life and realizing in life of most members of Chinese society, meet the various demands for the culture life of the people to the greatest extent, and play a positive role to political democracy , economic development and culture prosperity of our country finally. But on the other hand, because contemporary mass culture of China begin to be right away influenced by western mass culture colonialism to sprout, in addition, of our country social cultural dynamics of member is it improve to demand urgently, advanced development and construction of the spiritual civilization of culture also face a series of problems and challenges, so, some unhealthy symptoms and troubling situation have appeared in contemporary Chinese mass culture, live a great deal of field take place passive negative function already , can't adopt a casual attitude already to potential harmfulness its in society, can't act with undue haste. Chinese mass culture, has already inherited Chinese nation's outstanding cultural tradition , infected with the bad habits and acquired characteristics of western mass culture too, thus make the behavior characteristic of Chinese mass culture have dual natures. On one hand, Chinese mass culture has front characteristics , such as national characteristic , science and popularization ,etc., on the other hand, negative characteristics , such as commerciality , level and homogeneity with western mass culture too ,etc., demonstrate a kind of mixing and contradiction on the whole. This text passes the folk culture to the ancient times with appearing in history of people's culture, the new culture of period of the May Fourth Movement , citizen of old Shanghai of 1930s culture, and the comparing vertically of culture form, such as revolutionary popular Volkswagen literature and art,etc. before and after founding the state, have announced that they are in the popular and masses inherent consistency of culture, reveal them in nature and enormous difference functionally too at the same time . Through compare to people's culture and national ideology culture , crosswise of culture , elite of intellectual, have announced the independent character of people's culture development. Elites of people's culture, national ideology culture, intellectual culture, they are as three kinds of different culture forms existing extensively in the present society of our country, have represented three kinds of different meanings and pointed to the cultural function different from three kinds separately, complement each other, restrict each other between the three, form whole pattern of socialist culture of our country together. Chinese mass culture is regarded as a whole important component of culture with Chinese characteristics, itself including national , scientific , mass value pursue , have positive social functions inside, play a positive role to political democracy , economic development and culture prosperity of our country; But at the same time , because receive the western adverse effect of colonizing the effect of mass culture, in addition, the cultural dynamics of social members of our country is limited, thus aggravated the negative effects in social life of Chinese mass culture ,either. In general terms, the social function of contemporary Chinese mass culture demonstrates the contradiction characteristic conflicting each other ,too: In economic field, Chinese mass culture encouraged the Mormonism behavior while bringing about an advance in productivity; In the political field, Chinese mass culture clears up national ideology too while promoting national democratic politics construction; In the field of culture, It has also connived at cultural hegemony while promoting culture to share . Setting up the mass culture with Chinese characteristics, must adhere to three major principles: That is nationality, scientific and popularization. So-called national characteristic, it is development of culture that should inherit and develop Chinese nation outstanding cultural tradition and revolutionary cultural tradition, make great efforts to reflect modern life styles of the people, modern mode of thinking, modern behavior standard , modern morals sentiment , modern aesthetic temperament and interest , modern to conduct oneself in society attitude and modern prevailing custom; Meanwhile, culture should meet the needs of the world , put the cultural development of our country in great background of world culture development, absorb the outstanding cultural quintessence of the various nationalities in the world, with the independent open psychology , reject all its dresses unfavorable to the human development, learn wildly from other's strong points , is used by me. In short, keep not only keep one's own national characters but also and other national equal interchange of culture, realize absorbing each other, common development. What is called scientific, it is development of culture that must insist on scientific spirit that seek truth from facts, insist that the unifying of the theory and practice, will not merely develop rich and colorful philosophy social science and various kinds of literature and art, also should develop the educational culture and science and technology in a more cost-effective manner , with feudalistic superstition ,struggle pseudoscience and moribund ideology and culture firmly, remove culture rubbish constantly, one that is for society overall to offer assurance of ideology and culture while being progressive. What is called popularization, it is construction and development of culture that must regard vastest the people as starting point and home order, make culture become reflection that the people build great practice of socialist modernization, serve the people, educational people, enjoyed by the people conversely, thus make the people improve one's own thought cultural dynamics and level of science and culture constantly, become the new generation of people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education and a strong sense of discipline. Make great efforts to guide the positive factor of mass culture, criticize its negative factor in a more cost-effective manner, the ones that criticized built the rational form of future which constructs the mass culture of implicit national characteristic, scientific and popular characteristic, it is the great subject for research that Chinese mass culture puts forward to us. This text put forward criticize is it construct people's culture with Chinese characteristics get some countermeasures out of to build tentatively. Countermeasures these are it build constructing from macroscopic and microcosmic two level to China people's culture rationally to launch. On the microscopically level, mainly strengthen the humanity to mass culture of elite's culture to promote. We can say, all drawbacks of mass culture, its lies in the disappearance of humane spirit a bit more thoroughly. Dispel all sorts of drawbacks of people's culture, set up the healthy and progressive people's culture with Chinese characteristics, must inject humane spirit into people's culture. Humane spirit human reason appearing in value, to assemble on whole human inherent soul of culture life, it regards pursuing to the lofty value ideal of truth, good and beauty as the core, regards people's own development in an all-round way as the ultimate purpose. Practice has proved carry on humane promotion of spirit to people's culture, to dispel people's culture effective way of drawback. On the micro level, rely on national guide and concrete legal norm and various kinds of cultural policies that country make of ideology strengthen the production to people's culture mainly, circulation, consume all basin manage and standardize. Through promote government norm in microcosmic to humanity of macroscopic, people's culture of China ,, dispel its negative factor as much as possible , really builds and constructs meeting most social member's culture life's needs and people's culture with Chinese characteristics, it will be a great social subject that will be showing especially constantly in field of practice and theory .

It is an immensely complex and open system of literary criticism with the characteristics of both literary criticism and cultural criticism. Ecocriticism might succinctly be defined as study of the relation between literature and physical environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environment praxis. It takes an earth-centered approach to literary studies, and expands the notion of anthropocentric literary studies to include the entire ecosphere. All ecological criticism, based on holism and inter-relatedness of ecophilosophy, shares the premise that both human culture and human society are connected to physical world, affecting it and affected by it. Ecocriticism convincingly reveals that the ecological crisis in nature is the crisis of human civilization, human nature and imagination. Therefore, more science and more technology are not going to get us out of the present ecological crisis until we conscientiously involve the humanities and the social sciences in guiding them and solving ecological crisis in a big way. To root out the ecological crisis, we must go out of vicious circle of anthropocentrism, and dismantle the barriers between the modern sciences based on the mechanistic-reductionist character and Cartesian dualism. So ecocritics take the inter-disciplinary and cross-cultural, even cross-civilization approach to track down the fundamental causes of ecological crisis, and explore the effective strategies to cope with the ecological crisis. Both “interdisciplinarity” and “cross-culturality” are the two most distinct features of ecocriticism. Ecocriticism as a distinct critical school or movement originated in the United States of America, and is the product of the complicated social, academic and philosophical context. The direct cause of its birth is the increasingly deteriorating contemporary ecological crisis, the academic background of its birth the reaction to the contemporary literary criticism retreating from realistic ecological crisis, and the theoretical foundation of its birth the developing ecophilosophy. The dissertation consists of three parts. Its first part, that is, its first chapter, gives an overview of the social, academic and philosophical background of ecocriticism, its development, and its main contents as well as its theoretical foundation. It also points out the objective necessity that the anthropocentric paradigm must be replaced by ecocentric paradigm. Its second part can be divided into four chapters (chapter two, chapter three, chapter four and chapter five), and chiefly gives a systematic and profound study of the contents of Western ecocriticism. Chapter two focuses on the cultural criticism dimension in Western ecocriticism, and diagnoses the historical and cultural causes of the ecological crisis in a comprehensive and profound way. It points out that in the final analysis the ecological crisis is a crisis of Western culture, a crisis of human domination of nature, a crisis of developmental patterns, a crisis of social institutions as well as a crisis of human life-styles. Thus, ecocritics expose the nature of anthropocentrism and subvert it from interdisciplinary perspective. Lynn White opens up the cultural criticism dimension by criticizing anthropocentrism inherent in Christianity. Western Renaissance and Enlightenment humanism elevates man to the sole speaking subject and rational sovereign of natural order by overemphasizing human “reason”. Since then, voluble nature has become not only a mute object, but also a conquered, dominated and raped object. Modern Western science and technology pervaded by anthropocentrism further intensifies and expands man’s domination of nature. The picturesque aesthetic strengthens man’s domination in the name of natural beauty. In short, ecocentric philosophy constitutes a serious challenge to anthropocentrism. Its idea of holism and relatedness urges that on the one hand we must dig the ecological wisdom out of cultural traditions and bring out the inseparable kindredship between man and nature, on the other we must diagnose the complex cultural causes of the ecological crisis, so as to reform and green human cultures. Chapter three is about ecocritical reading of literary ecology, and its purpose is to eliminate the anti-ecological elements in it according to the ecological yardstick. First of all, the ecocritics attack the contemporary literary theories that repel and banish nature. Then the ecocritics also deconstruct and subvert the literary classics, even rewrite them. In the meantime, the ecocritics also try to expand and deepen the field of ecocriticism by integrating itself with other literary theories and drawing on a variety of theories, such as feminist, Marxist, poststructuralist theories. For example, ecofeminist literary theory sees the important connections between the domination of women and the domination of nonhuman nature, and both are the result of an oppressive patriarchal conceptual framework. Thus it opens up a new dimension of ecocriticism. Chapter four focuses on the regular forms of literary ecocentrism. Literary ecocentrism rejects the anthropocentric literary vision, and regards natural world, including man, as the subject of literary representation. Human subjects are only a species of natural world, and nature is far more than the stage of “the little human morality play”, the resources to be consumed, and the objects to be conquered. In the chapter the author first deals with the “aesthetics of relinquishment”, that is, giving up conquering and possessing nature, even giving up individual autonomy, centrality and the illusion of mental and even bodily apartness from one’s environment. Then the author switches to the ascription of subjectiveness to the nonhuman world. The nonhuman world entities such as the framework of seasons, the place, the animals and plants become the subjects of literary representation. What’s more, the author will study the writing of environmental apocalypticism. The ecological writers create master metaphors of ecocatastrophe to inspire man’s ecological conscience and cultivate man’s ecological sensibility so as to avert doom. Chapter five is concerned with the cross-cultural expansion of ecocriticism. The cultural diversity is the physical manifestations of ecological diversity, and ecological multiculturality urges that ecocriticism must explore the complexity of ecological issues and corresponding strategies from cross-cultural, even cross-civilization perspective. Ecocriticism rejects globalism and cultural hegemony that replace and devour the local knowledge and indigenous cultures, and calls for ecological democracy and cross-cultural ecological dialogues. Third part, that is, the last chapter of the dissertation, chapter six, gives a brief survey of the rise, development and present situation of Chinese ecocriticism (Chinese mainland). The author also points out its shortcomings from his own view, that is, both its awareness of comparative literature as discipline and its sense of theoretical building up are thin. The main academic values of the dissertation could be summarized as follows: 1. The result of the research is the first PhD dissertation in Chinese mainland, which deals with Western ecocriticism in a comprehensive and profound way, so it is a pioneer job. After having read a number of Western ecocritical classics, the author gives a systematic survey of Western ecotheory. In the meantime, the author also clearly defines the boundaries of Western ecocriticism, and its main features in general terms, and point out that both interdisciplinarity and cross-culturality are its two distinct features pervasive throughout the ecocritical academic activities. 2. Western ecocriticism has developed a comprehensive and open ecotheory with a solid ecophilosophical foundation, wide academic vision and rich academic practices, whereas Chinese ecocriticism is just in its infancy, with thin awareness of comparative literature as a discipline and theoretical building up at the initial stage. In the mean time, Chinese ecocritics have a very limited knowledge of Western ecocriticism. So the dissertation is of vital significance to Chinese ecocritical circle. What’s more, what the author used in the thesis is almost first-hand latest original materials. To have a comprehensive grasp of Western ecocriticism, the author collected a large number of ecocritical classics and related materials from England and America. Until now, the mainland China’s libraries have no these books or publications quoted in the dissertation, let alone their Chinese translation. Many ecocritical terms have been for the first time introduced into Chinese ecocritical circle by the author. So the dissertation could for sure contribute to having a good command of the development of Western ecocriticism, promote the communication and dialogue on ecological issues between China and the West, enhance the ecological vision and ecological thinking of Chinese ecocritics, and expand their academic vision. 3. The dissertation could make great contribution to promoting the development of comparative literature of China and expanding the field of its research. Ecocriticism may shift the foundation of thought of comparative literature from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism. The interdisciplinary and cross-cultural features of ecocriticism will open up new academic dimension of comparative literature, promote its greening tendency, and involve itself in the global ecological academic movement. Its interdisciplinary and cross-cultural studies are to promote not only the communication, the exchanges and the understanding between peoples, nations, and cultures, but also the reconciliation and harmony between man and nature; not only to eliminate the racism, cultural hegemony, but also to eradicate speciesism and species hegemony. If so, the existence of the Eurocentrism of comparative literature, cultural hegemonism, cultural isolationism as well as all the other isms based on prejudices, alienation, enmity and self-centeredness is unfounded, because they run counter not only to human cultures but also to ecological democracy. Both the interdisciplinary and cross-cultural features of ecocriticism expand the field of comparative literature to include the entire ecosphere. To sum up, the dissertation can promote the progress of ecocriticism in Chinese mainland, the construction of Chinese ecological discourse as well as the dialogue on ecological issues between China and the West for sure. In the meantime, it can contribute to the greening of comparative literature studies and expand further its field of research.",1025014444, 西方生态批评研究,Dissertations & Theses," Hu, Hong ZhiHuZhiHongHu, Hong Zhi胡志红", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711615591 , 70440992 , 189128 , H133222 , H133222", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 西方生态批评研究,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1025014444?accountid=14496, 0401 Literature, 0401 Literature, 0401 Literature,, 0401 Literature, Literature," (UMI)AAIH133222 , Language, literature and linguistics , cross-culturality , ecocentrism , ecocriticism , interdisciplinarity , 生态中心主义 , 生态批评 , 跨学科 , 跨文化",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+Western+Ecocriticism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hu%2C+Hong+Zhi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3765,On Public Capital,"The public capital is the capitalization of public assets, the organic unification of the public-owned content and capital form, the key to understand that the socialist basic system combines with market economic system, and the key and peculiar category of the socialist market economy. It only contacts the certain historical stage especially the primary stage of socialism, produces with formulation of socialist market economy, develops but develops, and withers away as it withers away. As the general form of value, the public capital is a kind of factor of production in conformity with large-scale social production, playing an irreplaceable role to the productivity development of the primary stage of socialism; And as the special form of value, the public capital reflect the double social relationships of "" the labor engages the capital and the capital engages the labor "" under the socialist market economy condition , it is "" cube barranca of Kraft "" that must be crossed in the socialist development process. This text divides six chapters altogether. Chapter one: the introduction, mainly introduces the reason, current situation, method and frame of the public capital studying, and has defined the public capital category. Understanding the public capital in the historical process of socialism movement, regarding the emergence, development of the public capital as the basic clue, finding the basic law of socialist market economic development, thus undertaking the historical mission of the theory worker of Marxism, it is our main reason of studying public capital. But as the speech of current situation of the studying on the public capital, the energy that the academia invests is far unbecoming to compare with the status of public capital as key category of socialist market economy. Studying the public capital, just as studying other social relationships, there is an academic position question, this is unavoidable as for researcher. We stand at Marxism position, use Marxist history and logic unified method and contradiction analytic approach study the public capital mainly; At the same time in order to avoid causing it through the dispute of the institute type as much as possible, used the analytic approach of the real example in a large amount too. Using these methods, we have investigated the public capital category, have analyzed the forming, producing, circulating, distributing, running and managing of the public capital, and sum up and analyze its contradiction on the basis of summarizing these practices, then analyze the development trend of the public capital further according to the public capital contradiction. This is basic train of thought and frame of this text. Coming to define in terms of its content, form and history regulation, the public capital is the capitalizing of public assets, it is the unifying organically of the public-owned content and capital form, it is the value that can bring surplus value to the socialist state and collective. It is the key category and peculiar category of the socialist market economy, only contacts the certain historical stage especially the primary stage of socialism, produces with formulation of socialist market economy, develops but develops, and withers away as it withers away . Chapter two: The forming of the public capital. Mainly research socialized gradual progress of the private capital and production of the public capital in the socialist state. Investigating the socialist movement from fact and the public capital in the historical process of socialist movement, we find two roads run parallel with: The socialization of private capital in developed capitalist nations and the production of public capital in socialist states whose economy and culture are relatively backward. Outwardly it seems that the two take their own roads, irrelevant at all, but they closely connect and influence each other in fact. As to historical order, formerly socializing of private capital in capitalist nations, producing of public capital in socialist state in after, the production of public capital walks abreast just with a certain stage of private capital socialization, and the socialization of private capital in developed capitalist nations form the background and external reason that public capital produce in socialist states of economy and culture relatively backward. Private capital, with the constant development of the large-scale social production, grow from ownership of the private capital to ownership of private share capital after going through one, and then reach the course of ownership of corporation share capital (namely corporation capital ownership ). The most obvious trend that this course embodies is the socialization day by day of the capital. And the final result of private capital socialization day by day must be “turning the capital into the public one which belongs to all social members' property”, “it will lose its class nature "". Public capital, the economic category which an author of a classic of Marxism had never involved, in the process of reform and opening-up of socialist state that economy and culture is relatively backward, under the background of fact that the private capital is socialized and the globalization process is accelerated day by day, arises at the historic moment as the setting-up of the socialist market economy system. Public capital, there is course of a primitive accumulation too. “Depriving depriver"", namely the private capital leaving over old China was changed into the socialist state-owned property; Leading and transforming the self-employed laborer, namely carries on the transformation to agriculture and private industry and commerce; Implementing the high accumulation rate, namely carries on "" depriving oneself "" of the socialism type; Through "" scissors difference"", by mending the worker's industrial policy agriculturally, the value was shifted from the agricultural surplus labor. The way of these public capital primitive accumulation, though not like the capitalist primitive accumulation was "" written into human annals with the characters of blood and fire "" like that, adopt ultra compulsive means of economy too , accumulate conditions of "" labor hires capital "" and "" capital hires labor "" within shorter time, namely to form the “ prehistory ” of public capital. Chapter three: The production, circulation and distribution of the public capital. Mainly research the universal law and special law of the production, circulation and distribution of public capital, as well as how to perfect the system that the public capital is produced, circulated and distributed. The production and circulation of the public capital follows the universal law of the production and circulation of the capital, and there is its own particularity too at the same time. Decided by the production of public capital, the distribution of public capital adopts the double level of distribution under socialist market economy, namely the mode combined distributing in money and distributing according to work, of which the first grade is distribution in money, the second is distribution according to work. The law that the public capital was produced, circulated and distributed, has reflected the basic state of circuitous development of public ownership under socialist market economy. Public capital production is the unity of work course and value multiplication course. In this course, not only the use value of meeting working people's needs, but also the surplus value of public capital has been produced. This is the characteristic of public capital production. For this reason, public assets turn into the public capital, it is the prerequisite that public capital is produced; the workforce turns into the goods under the socialist market economy condition, it is the prerequisite that public assets turn into the public capital. As value production, the public capital production must follow the universal law that value is produced. To encourage the enterprises to compete in the market, to mould public-owned enterprises into a qualified market main body, to set up modern enterprise system, to adjust the state-run economic layout and development strategy on the whole, it is an inevitable request that value is produced. The public capital circulation follows the universal law that the capital circulates, such as the circulation law of the capital, the turnover law of the capital and the law of that the means of production have priority to increase; and it has its own particularity too at the same time. Because of the decision of double goal of production and management, public capital circulation is not regulated all by surplus law of value and law of value. To the disposition of public capital resources, the planned mechanism will be used frequently besides using the market mechanism. Because of the special position and function of the public capital in our national economy, the flow, circulation of the public capital will exert an important influence on macro-economy operation. So to perfect the public capital circulation system, we must combine universal law and special law that the public capital circulates, must adhere to the scrupulous attitude to advance and retreat and structural adjustment of the public capital. We should follow the universal law of market economy, should consider the will of the people and the national conditions too. The distribution of the public capital is in the leading position under the socialist market economy condition in general capital distribution. The general capital distribution means the total distribution pattern of the national income under the socialist market economy condition, namely the distribution pattern of the total surplus value of public capital and private capital and laborer’s salary, its essence is to handle the country, enterprise and individual interests well. The general capital distribution is rational basically in our country, and the incomes of the country, enterprise and resident are balanced on the whole. But a lot of question are exposed and happened too at the same time, especially such that financial support is heavily different under different industry, so that some industries can not get very good development for a long time. And that the wage level of different trade draws heavy, this cause the society to pay close attention to fair problem. As regards itself, the distribution of public capital means the interests partition among the country or the collective and laborer. Because the relations between public capital and labor are double employer-employee relationships under the socialist market economy condition, namely relations that "" labor hiring capital-capital hiring labor "", so, the public capital distribution is divided into two levels accordingly: The first level is to assign according to the relation of "" capital hires labor "", namely the country obtained public surplus value in the capacity of investor, worker obtained salary in the provider's identity with the workforce. Therefore, the distribution of the first level is the distribution that is determined by the market mechanism, paying attention to efficiency. The second level is to reallocate according to the relation of “labor hires capital "", the united laborer realizes its right that asks for surplus value in the capacity of final owner. So the distribution of the second level is carried on in the form of macro adjustments and controls by the country, laying particular emphasis on the justice. According to the current situation of the public capital distribution, the publicly-owned enterprise's overall wage level advances by leaps and bounds since reform and opening-up, but the out-of-balance question of the structure exists too, wages level difference of different trade, different area are all greater, the public capital should solve the inside fair problem too when being distributed. The problem existing in the field of public capital distribution will be solved effectively only through perfecting public capital distribution system constantly. This kind of distribution system has already been different from public assets under planned economic system to distribute, also different from capital distribution in the capitalist country. We should pay attention to efficiency through the function of the market mechanism, as well as pay attention to justice through strengthening government regulating function in income distribution. How to set up efficient and fair distribution system, it is the big problem that we still need to probe further in practice. Chapter four: the operation and management of the public capital. Mainly research how to run and manage the public capital according to its essence and law. The problems of public capital in the course of producing, circulating and distributing, show evidently as how to operate and manage public capital at present. Public capital operation is to operate it according to the law that the public capital moves, to make the use of the public capital give play to the greatest efficiency. The main form of the public capital operation is the state-run capital operation. As the main respect of the public capital operation, the state-run capital operation regard improving the utilization benefit of the state-run capital as object, regard market mechanism as the basic means. It is a kind of operational and managerial activities that on the basis of the separation of two rights of state-run capital, the country proceeds from whole state-run economic development strategy as the investor, enterprises proceed from their own development strategy as the microcosmic main body, the two go on scientific plan and effective operation at different levels. However, the public capital operation is at its initial stage yet, there are still a lot of questions in practice, such that the public-owned enterprises are not complete market main bodies, the non market-oriented factors still exist; The capital market development is not perfect yet; Ignore the production and management, put undue emphasis on the capital operation; The social security system is still imperfect, etc.. In order to solve the problem that exist in the public capital operation, make the public capital operation more efficient with benefit, the most key one is to set up and perfect the supervision and management system of the public capital. While using experience of management of the foreign state-run capital for reference, to summarize the successful management mode appearing in the state-owned economy evolution of our country actively, basic train of thought has been proposed by the 16th National Congress that ""the central government and local government fulfils contributor’s duty on behalf of the country respectively "". According to this train of thought, the State Council passes through and issues ""the provisional administrative regulations of the supervision of enterprise's state-run assets”, which indicates that the state-run economic reform of our country develops from the stage of the definition of property right and the exploration of property right mode to the management stage of the public capital. Certainly, the regulation is only “interim regulation"", a lot of questions especially property right questions are still need to study and probe further in practice. Chapter five: public capital contradiction. Mainly research inherent contradiction, external contradiction and the rule of public capital development as well as the impact of the public capital contradiction on its production and running. The production, circulation, distribution, running and management of the public capital, is shown as circuitous advancement in practice, which is decided by the inherent contradiction of the public capital and limited by its external contradiction again at the same time. The inherent contradiction of the public capital is the contradiction of public-owned content and the capital form, and it stipulates the basic trend of the public capital development. The external contradiction of the public capital is the contradiction of public capital and private capital, and it plays a role in accelerating or delaying the development of the public capital. The expansion of the public capital inherent contradiction is its production, circulation, distribution, running and management, and the expansion of the public capital external contradiction is the concrete mode of the competition as well as cooperation between public capital and private capital. The inherent contradiction of public capital concentratedly embodies in the relation of a series of unity of opposites including non-exclusiveness and exclusiveness, social benefit and economic benefits, worker controlling the means of production and the means of production controlling worker, distribution according to work and distribution in money etc. Meanwhile, in two kinds of concrete forms of the public capital -- state-run capital and collective capital, the form of expression of these contradictions is different to some extent. The inherent contradiction of the public capital is having important influence on production and management of the public capital, because it is embodied in the contradiction of the ownership of the capital and the power of management in practice, namely the contradiction of who own the capital and who run the capital. This is exactly the key problem that we make sure progress but do not solved at all so far in our country socialist market economic development process. The external contradiction of the public capital includes two respects of belligerence and identity. As regards belligerence, it is the relation that the public capital and the private capital are distinguished and competed for, and there are obvious differences in the respects, such as the interests goal and way that the two are pursuing, the distribution method of surplus value and the relation of the two and working, and the capital accumulation way and trend, etc., at the same time the two are carrying on keen competition on the market as different interests main body. As to identity, it is the relation of interdependence, transfixion each other and transform each other between public capital and private capital, embodying in the cooperation on the market of two, such as participating in each other by shares, permeating each other, and the transformation of control power or the transformation of the capital form taking place when the condition is ripe. But the total trend is that the private capital turns into the public capital more and more, and in competing, the public capital studies experience of the private capital constantly, revises its own deficiency , thus improves and strengthens itself in the market competition rapidly, obtains more and more shareholding , and realizes the transition from expansion of quantity to qualitative leap finally, finishes this specific historical category of the public capital with revolutionary significance to deny itself, thus, the public ownership can be realized in more appropriate form on higher, more perfecting and riper level. Chapter six: the sublation of the private capital and expansion of the public capital. Mainly research the historical process of the self-sublation of private capital and the historical trend of the expansion of public capital. The two points to the same goal that socialism will replace capitalism finally through public capital replace private capital. The inexorable development trend of public capital contradiction is that the public capital denies the private capital and finally denies itself, and the private capital itself has a course self-denied. Development from the form of the private owner to the shareholding system form and then to the form of the state-run capital, has reflected the course that the private capital transforms from private capital to social capital with constant development of the large-scale social production. This transformation has relaxed the social contradiction of the capitalism, and has accumulated the condition for the new mode of production. However, it has not gone beyond the range of the private capital, so Marx calls this kind of transformation ""the passive sublation"". In the process of the self-sublation of the private capital, there has appeared in "" worker's own cooperative factory "" within the capitalist society, which can be regarded as a kind of economic form similar to the public capital, for it sublates the opposition between capital and labor, Marx calls this kind of sublation as ""the active sublation"". In the current international market, the position of the public capital is similar to that of the “cooperative factory"" in the capitalist domestic market. Though the public capital is still very small and weak can be regarded as it “the first breach that old form is open in the old form "", there are far-reaching meanings. The expansion of capital is the natural instinct of it. The expansion of the private capital promotes the process of the economic globalization, which makes the capitalism grow from country's monopoly capitalism to international monopoly capitalism, and these form the international background that public capital monopolizes with the competition. Through summarizing the historical law of capital development, we can find that monopoly, despite the negative effect of suppressing the technological progress, is one chapter that must be written in the history of the capital. It is the centralized inevitable outcome of production, yet conversely promotes production to be centralized further again. It is the catalyst which makes capital socialized to form the extensive capital, and conversely the socialized capital often accumulates the condition that monopoly expands. Monopoly squeezes but does not eliminate the competition, the competition between the monopolies is larger, the degree is fiercer. The modes of the profit of monopoly are ""ed leave metrically together"" as monopoly develops till today, on the one hand it obtaining monopoly profits relying on its monopoly position, on the other hand speeding up technological development to keep its leading advantage in the trade. So, while seeing negative consequence monopolized at the present age, we should see its function as the social capital catalyst objectively too. The public capital must allow “rational monopoly”, the domestic monopoly facing the international monopoly capital, if the public capital wants to form the enterprises colony analogous to the scale of the capital to participate in the international competition. The purpose that we maintain the “rational monopoly” of public capital is to accelerate the speed of accumulation of the public capital, make it rank among the ranks of the transnational group quickly, as many as possible as much as possible. But the public capital has just come into being, and still in transforming, it also mainly lays particular emphasis on inside merger at present, so the strategy of implementing “walking out "" will be a very long course. Even so, but paces that the public capital expands will not stop. The motive force that the public capital expands depends on the pursuit of publicly-owned surplus value and pressure of the market competition, yet the trend that the public capital expands depends on the development of inherent contradiction and external contradiction of the public capital. So, the dialectical movement course in practice of contradiction of the public capital is the historical course naturally of public capital accumulation, and the historical course that the public capital expands constantly as the ones that accumulate go on continuously. And with the development of contradiction movement of the public capital, the accumulation of the public capital will develop in the unity of twists and advancement too, and the public capital will demonstrate certain wave accordingly too in its expansion. And just in the course of such dialectical development, the public capital will sublate itself constantly, also sublate the private capital in the course of expansion of it at the same time, until finish its historical mission and exit from socialist stage of economic history.",1025274735, 论公有资本,Dissertations & Theses," Zheng, Hua DongZhengDongHuaZheng, Hua Dong郑东华", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711751821 , 70434232 , 189128 , H160677 , H160677", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 论公有资本,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1025274735?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH160677 , Social sciences , 公有资本、私有资本、社会主义市场经济、public capital、private capital、socialist market economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+Public+Capital&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zheng%2C+Hua+Dong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3766,The Study on Financial Risk During Transitional Period And on Transferring of Fiscal Risk to Financial Risk,"Along with accelerating reforms of financial system and state-owned enterprises, financial risks have been drawing increasing attentions, especially since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. How to prevent and avert financial risks thus need to be investigated into. In order to control the financial risks or to tackle any financial crisis in China, it is necessary to clearly understand the systemic reasons, and internal and external factors that cause the financial risks. Theoretically, financial risks stem from limitation of sensibility and asymmetry of information, but the features of financial risks vary in different countries for specific reasons. There are quantities of papers on the common reasons for financial risks, but few on the financial risks in China during transitional period, especially on transferring of fiscal risk in China to financial risks. Having analyzed the special formation system of financial risks during the transitional period and the transferring of the fiscal risks, this thesis manages to explore the pre-warning system and strategy to prevent and avert financial risk during transitional period in China. The thesis consists of six chapters. It begins with reviewing of former theories on the financial risk and constructing of a new theory framework, which shall be the basis to further investigate. Then it systematically looks into the formation mechanism of financial risk from internal formation system and external transferring system. Having reviewed the pre-warning system in foreign countries and the transferring of fiscal risks in China to financial risks, it investigates both the internal and external factors that cause the financial risks during the transitional period in China. Finally, it comes up with suggestions on how to establish new type relations between fiscal system and financial system, and strategies to avert financial risks. Chapter One carries detailed analysis of Marxist and Western theories on financial risks after analysis of generic theories and reasons for formation of financial risks. According to the author, financial risks refer to the magnitude and probability of losses caused to the entity by uncertainty and fluctuation in the economic factors in the financial market under certain conditions and in certain periods. The magnitude and probability of losses are essential to reflect financial risks. Generally, the financial risks stem mainly from economic and social specialization, multiform of its derivative transactions, limited sensibility and opportunistic inclinations by economic participants, uncertainty of economic conditions, asymmetry of information, and financial system and its evolvement. Chapter Two systematically analyzes the formation of the financial risks mainly from financial system, economic structure, and opening economy. It argues that under the floating exchange rate system, there usually exists excessive fluctuation and mismatch in the exchange rates. The floating exchange rate system will speed up the internationalization of virtual capital, and then increase the uncertainty and risks of the financial markets. Then weakened control by monetary authority over the speculative capitals contributes to the fast growth and movement of speculative capitals and thus generates negative impacts on the world economy. However, under the highly integrated global financial system, the peg system will also have irresolvable internal conflicts. When the control over capital flows is loosened, the peg system will usually magnify the external impacts and thus make a currency crisis and the Domino Effect quite easy. Among those factors leading to financial crisis, actual economic and investment activities are always the main ones. It can be seen from the flaws and mistakes in economic and investment activities, financial risks caused by economic cyclical fluctuations and structural changes. Even the financial investment process that is more and more deeply affected by the formation process of financial risks is also subject to the actual economic and investment activities. In addition, modern information transmission and financial liberalization substantially accelerate fund moving in the global financial market. Investors, fund-suppliers, and markets in each country thus all merge into global financial market. Such a global capital moving, far beyond goods and merchandise, becomes one of most active factors in the current world economy, and then forcibly influences the allocation of international financial resources in the global range, and alternates each country’s economic efficiency, and increases the volatility and uncertainty of price signal, and supply and demand of financial transactions. Especially, a large scale of international short-term capital consequently imposes impact on the effectiveness of macro-economic policies of each government and on the micro-decision of each sort of economic entity. Chapter Three preliminarily explores the modality of establishment of financial risk pre-warning and prevention system in China based on empirical study of the foreign financial risk pre-warning and prevention system. The author argues that all macro-departments are inter-related and there exist causal relations among macro-economic indicators, and continuously worsened macro-economic indicators always come first before financial crisis. A pre-warning system can inform people of an impending financial crisis and help the people to avert it. History teaches people that it is urgent and necessary to set up a system to monitor the financial risks. In reality, it is very difficult to analyze and forecast financial risks and crises. Such a comprehensive analysis on different types of financial risks is imperative. It is difficult to classify a financial crisis into a certain category, but a big financial crisis always comes after an unbalanced economy that contains a certain kind of financial risk. Therefore, pre-warning should start from pre-warning on the initial financial risks, which is significant in preventing the outbreak of financial crises. Chapter Four systematically analyzes both the internal and external factors causing the financial crisis during the transitional period in China respectively from the structural factors, market factors and international factors. The purpose to study the financial crisis in China is to get to know the features of financial risks in China and to prevent the financial safety in China from the accumulation of financial risks. The author believes that there exist diversity and controllability of financial risks in a market economy while concentration and invisibility in the planning system. Then accumulation and acceleration will feature the financial risks during the transitional periods in China. At present, China is transforming from planning system to market economy; both old and new systems coexist. On the one hand, old system is still functioning in many areas of the social economy, blocking the setup and operating of the new system. On the other hand, the new system originating from the old system is still imperfect and can not yet effectively regulate and adjust its own operations. As a result, the new system has to resort to the old system. Under the current special circumstances the financial risks in China not only carries the generic risks in the market economy and traditional risks during the early stages of financial market but also are featured as systemic risks during the transitional period in China. The author has indicated that financial problems are results of long-term accumulation, reflecting multi-layer internal conflicts embedded in the economy: not only systemic factors but also managerial factors, not only structural reasons arising from the transitions from the planning economy to the market economy but also imbalances generated from the financial system reforms; not only problems generated from transitions from closed economic system to the open economic system but also problems stemming from imbalances in the market economy; not only historical problems but also new problems generated from the excessive expansion of capital because of the soft budgeting. Due to the complexity, diversity and comprehensiveness, comprehensive measures and strategies must be taken against financial risks. Chapter Five systematically analyzes the transferring of the fiscal risks in China to the financial risk based on its elaborating of relations between fiscal risks and financial risks. Owing to defects of fiscal policy in China and mismatch of fiscal and monetary policies, it is a long period the state treasury has been leading to accumulation of financial risks by having financial institutions finance its expenditures by which fiscal risks were transferred. In other words, the transferring of fiscal risks to financial risks relies on the close relations between state treasury and financial institutions. The author argues that banks depend on the balance of fund flow-in and flow-out with a steady state. While the outcome of the transferring of fiscal risks to banks will be to utilize the fund of saving deposit, and then the assets of this utilization will mainly evolve risk assets of the banks. Such a transferring weakens banks’ liquidity and violates business order of banking sector, and brings about many of restructure, withdrawal and bankruptcy of financial institutions. Nevertheless the cost of dissolving the risks are much higher than one of leading to risks. Chapter Six comes up with ideas and methodologies to prevent and dissolve financial risks in China from the aspects of strategies, environments, macro &amp; micro-economic policies. The author proves that both state treasury and financial institutions are fund providers, but different features of the funds from two channels define their range and mechanism and objects. Sometimes state treasury and financial institutions overlap their activities, but such a overlapping cannot change the basic features of non-compensation of fiscal fund or compensation of credit fund. So fiscal activities and financial activities shall abide each own rules and play proper roles in different areas. In practice, the most important task is currently to define the functions of state treasury and financial institutions and the relations of these two fund suppliers, and then to confine the activities of two sectors and the rules for special issues. Thus, to effectively prevent and dissolve financial risks during transitional period in China need not only flexibly coordinating fiscal and monetary policies, but also taking corresponding measures at the levels of macro µ economies. At the period when financial institutions adopt modern enterprise system and rules, supervisory institution shall adapt itself to the trend of mixing financial businesses and establish the financial supervision and administration system that suits China’s situations.",1025420575," 经济转轨时期金融风险问题研究                ——兼论财政风险向金融风险的转嫁路径",Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Qiang TianZhangTianQiangZhang, Qiang Tian张天强", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711751251 , 70481292 , 189128 , H161580 , H161580", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese," 经济转轨时期金融风险问题研究                ——兼论财政风险向金融风险的转嫁路径",2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1025420575?accountid=14496, 0508 Finance, 0508 Finance, 0508 Finance,, 0508 Finance, Finance," (UMI)AAIH161580 , Social sciences , 经济转轨、金融风险、财政风险、Transitional Period、Financial Risk、Fiscal Risk",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Study+on+Financial+Risk+During+Transitional+Period+%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0AAnd+on+Transferring+of+Fiscal+Risk+to+Financial+Risk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Qiang+Tian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3767,The Comparative Study of the Socialism Development Values of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,"Development is the eternal theme of human society. Development viewpoint to about total viewpoint and basic viewpoint of social development , instruct people carry on cardinal principle of social work. Dialectical materialism think what kind of development viewpoint does it have , what kind of development paths does it have. If development one boat that brave the wind and the waves, develop viewpoint to is it sail the steersman in the direction to administer. Whether a society could establish the correct development viewpoint , concerns the development that this society could be healthy , lasting , overall. So, it is essential to development and progress of the human society to develop the viewpoint. The socialist cause is mankind's brand-new undertaking. Persons who are regarded as the initiator and development of China's socialist cause of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping respectively, in exploring that there is course of the development path of socialism with chinese characteristics, form two have close connection , have obvious socialism of difference develop the viewpoint. No matter Mao Zedong, or Deng Xiaoping, socialism is development viewpoint have abundant content very. But Mao Zedong socialism development viewpoint Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping socialism develop viewpoint no Deng Xiaoping Theory after all, socialism develops the viewpoint just about the cardinal principle of the social development, can't attend to each and every aspect of a matter . So this text has just chosen the development path and development model in term of developing the viewpoint, developing stage , developing several respects , such as motive force and central task , development goal and strategic plan ,etc., socialism of great man develop viewpoint carry on comparative analysis , is it find out the difference of the two and get in touch to aim at to two. Because of this, whole logic structure of this text and main content are formed by five parts: First, theory resource and history , era background analyse This part compare Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping socialist development theory origin and different history , era background that viewpoint produce to analyse mainly. In Marx, Engels , Lenin , Stalin, there then , is it describe about socialist development system of viewpoint to have, no more successful experience about socialist construction either. So, Mao Zedong, with Deng Xiaoping when explore the Chinese socialism development problem, theory resource and successful socialist construction experience that can utilize are quite limited. The national conditions that Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping face are "" poor and underdeveloped "", have a large population, based on a weak economy. But the understanding of the national conditions is different. Mao Zedong regards "" poor and underdeveloped "" as the advantage , "" easy to write with the newest and most beautiful characters, easy to draw the newest and most beautiful picture "", have ignored socialist arduousness of developing, mistake of making "" left "" to incline and advance rashly in socialism is developed. Deng Xiaoping see "" have a large population , based on a weak economy "" unfavorable one side , is it develop socialist long period of time and arduousness to put emphasis on more, pay attention to doing solid work , looking for the truth and be practical further in developing. Era that Mao Zedong face theme"" war and revolution "", excessive to estimate that erupts the danger of the world war, have influenced the decision to the development strategy of Mao Zedong. Deng Xiaoping has held theme "" peace and development "" of the era at that time correctly, pay attention to developing further, safeguard the peace. Mao Zedong Times, the mainstream of the international communist movement is that eager to carry out the transition to communism producing the wind altogether prevails, Mao Zedong's "" catching up with and surpassing strategy "" is influenced by this and put forward. In Deng Xiaoping times, the reform is a mainstream of the international communist movement at that time, so, Deng Xiaoping regards reform and opening-up as the only way of China's social doctrine development. Second, about the development path and socialist development model This part of is analysis mainly compare Mao Zedong and the development road of the option of Deng Xiaoping and their two differences develop pattern. found country initial stage, China is basically in building have copied Soviet pattern. along with Soviet pattern abuse expose , Mao Zedong have put forward "" is warning with the Soviet Union, "" "" go to own road, "" thought, begin explore accord with the socialist development road of Chinese reality more, try hard breakthrough Soviet pattern. but because of Mao Zedong "" is left , "" incline the influence of thought, do not break through the planned pattern of economic system of high concentration eventually. Deng Xiaoping in summarize historical experience give the socialist road of Chinese characteristic a lesson foundation on, have put forward go have , have established the system of socialist market economy develop pattern, make the socialist construction of China have gone to the orbit of healthy development. Third, about developing stage of socialism This part of is analysis mainly compare Mao Zedong "" two stage theory "" with the socialist elementary stage theory of Deng Xiaoping content. Mao Zedong have put forward : socialism may divide into "" not developed socialism "" and "" more developed socialism "" two stages, our country is still in "" not developed socialism "" stage. reforming and opening up to the outside world after, Deng Xiaoping have gone on for the socialist located stage of our country know again, have put forward the theory of socialist elementary stage, have established "" a central, two basic points "" socialist elementary stage basic route. Fourth, about develop motive force and central task of socialism In socialism develop power aspect, Mao Zedong have put forward "" basic contradictory power theory "", point out the contradiction between production relation and productivity, superstructure and the contradiction between economic foundation is still the basic contradiction of socialist society, is promote socialist basic power. discuss according to basic contradictory power, have put forward the basic task of socialist society is "" protect and develop productivity, "". Deng Xiaoping in 11 classes of 3 in plenary after, have put forward "" reform power theory "", in reform production relation and superstructure the basic task of socialism and the abuse of obstruction productivity development is "" liberate and develop productivity "", reform is 2th Chinese revolutionary. Fifth, about the socialist development goal and strategic plan In socialism develop goal aspect, Mao Zedong have put forward realization 4 modern goals, realize industry, agriculture, defence and the modernization of science and technology . for realize this magnificent goal, Mao Zedong have again established "" two steps goes "" strategic deployment. Deng Xiaoping inherit and develop the thought of the 4 modern goals of Mao Zedong , have put forward "" become the construction of our country , is prosperous, democratic , civilized socialist modern country "" goal. for realize this goal, Deng Xiaoping put forward "" three steps goes "" strategic deployment.

The company was founded in 1980, originally called China Posts and Telecommunications Industry Corporation. It is a state key enterprise directly under the leadership of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC). The company owns CHINA PUTIAN Co., Ltd., which consists of 7 companies: PUTIAN Capitel, PUTIAN Eastcom, Ningbo Electronics, Beijing Ericsson PUTIAN, Nanjing Ericsson Panda, PUTIAN Taili, PUTIAN Designing &amp; Planning Institute for Engineering. Besides that, CHINA PUTIAN also owns over 40 companies directly invested by the headquarters, which include 5 listed companies- Shanghai P&amp;T, Chengdu Cable and Nanjing PUTIAN are directly invested by headquarters; PUTIAN Eastcom and Ningbo Bird are indirectly invested by headquarters. CHINA PUTIAN is a leading one among top 100 enterprises in China's IT industry, and ranked excessively the No. 1 of Top 100 Chinese Electronic &amp; Information Enterprises in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, CHINA PUTIAN ranks No. 1 among the overall listing of China's largest enterprise groups in the manufacture sector of electronic and communication equipments. It ranks No. 5 both in the listings of 500 largest import &amp; export and 200 largest export enterprises issued by the Ministry of Commerce of China. CHINA PUTIAN's business scope covers both fixed and mobile communications. Its available communication equipments and terminal products include: mobile communication network equipments and handsets, optical transmission equipments and communication cables, PDF and connectors, power supplies, microwave communication equipments, telecommunication network Operation Support Systems (OSS), SPC switch, videophones and IC card payphones, PHS handsets, logistics information system and equipments for industries, ITS series products, office information equipments and etc, as well as project contracting home and abroad, international cooperation, technology transfer, products import and export and etc. Since it was born under the planned economy, China Putian gets many serious problem with its marketing framework, such as branches overlapped, overstaffed, half and unclear assignment, faulty merit system, lay much more emphasis upon sales than marketing. CHINA PUTIAN's marketing network includes two networks of market development and after-sales service, which has about 700 relative offices covering almost all the areas above county level in China. CHINA PUTIAN has established 8 representative offices in Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Xi'an. China Putian equips its framework with the marketing department, but the department puts its all force into market scheme and distribution. It’s vague and general, far from real market, unresponsive to the marketing information, lack of essential effort towards marketing. China Putian has a group of subsidiaries who do the market in their own way, and it is lack of management and development over the whole holding market. This seriously stunts China Putian’s growth. In the fast developing industry, China Putian must find a way suitable for itself and went along with the developing direction of the industry. Telecommunication industry will be the largest industry in the world of 21th century, it is the base of modern economy and leader of society development. At the same time, the industry needs knowledge and technique, and provides high percentage of social employment. It can be a continuously developing industry, with low input and high efficiency. But it also hides with high risk, high competition and high investment. In China, telecommunication industry has its own specific character. Considering both the practice of China Putian and the specialty of the industry, the thesis designs a whole framework of marketing for China Putian. It first expatiates the differences between sales and marketing, and the importance of marketing, also introduces the successful experiences of corporations in the industry to set out the importance and bright future for the marketing of China Putian. It has significant influence to set out a suitable marketing framework in a corporation. A corporation’s living base is marketing. So marketing should be given highest attention throughout the corporation, from investment planning, personnel training to the setting up of an effective marketing framework. Thus, China Putian will have an overall marketing structure. The thesis gives a design of marketing frame for China Putian, considering its own features. The marketing frame is formed of seven functional parts. They are government department, align department, partner department, sales communicating department, product developing department, international market developing department and promoting department. The thesis lists their organic system, ruling extension and duties. The departments set up due to different courses: Government department: as a state-owned corporation, China Putian’s products and services may be greatly influenced by government’s policies. It is very important to the corporation to remain good relationship with the government. Being the practicer and witness of the rapid growth of Chinese IT industry at all times, CHINA PUTIAN and its subsidiaries have attracted great attention from national Communist Party of China (CPC) and government leaders. Those leaders' sincere concern and support can be found in the development history of CHINA PUTIAN. Align department: its main assignment are to absorb right personnel, to supplement each other with resources in the industry, to gain a better and healthier environment for the development of the corporation, to promote the develop of the whole industry to gain the scale economy. Under the new market mechanism and the support of friends from all walks of life, CHINA PUTIAN will establish good cooperation relationships with all major telecommunication carriers in China by resorting to its own technical merit and industrial capacity. Partner department: it’s a channel cleaner between the corporation and final market, to make the channel expedite and healthy, to organize its affiliated enterprises to undertake important projects of constructing state public and private networks and to provide total solutions for manufacture, design, installation, test, etc. It is important to set up an information-sharing channel for innovators and potential partners working in academia or the business world, aiming to promote cooperation. Now our country is facing a strategic period and it's also a vital one for the development of IT industry. CHINA PUTIAN should cooperate with the partner in and out of the industry, to meet government's requirements, carry out reforms proactively, strengthen the integration of group resource, enhance competence and manage to create values for clients, so as to become better, stronger and more stable, and make greater contributions to China's IT industry. Product developing department: it is a vanguard of the corporation’s R&amp;D towards the market demands, and finds new way of developing market, to widen the business of the corporation. CHINA PUTIAN promotes technical innovation and continually consolidats its R&amp;D on telecom technologies and products with its independent intellectual property right. CHINA PUTIAN R&amp;D System includes central research institute and its branches. In November 2001, CHINA PUTIAN set up its central research institute-CHINA PUTIAN Institute of Technology and later four branches in Capitel, Eastcom, Runway, and Smartcomm in succession. This central research institute is responsible for the comprehensive management and planning of over 80 PUTIAN's research institutions. In July 2003, CHINA PUTIAN Institute of Technology (Shanghai) was formally in operation. It will provide mobile phone chipset and RF module with own core technologies for PUTIAN Group and deepen terminal R&amp;D in core level. Promotion department: modern marketing strategy aims much more on the reputation of the corporation by have promotion activities toward products related with the looks, characters, purchasing issues and benefits to the customers, etc. And of course all of these promotion should be based on the right products for the aimed customers, in all the aspects of meeting the needs of final customers, went along with the fashion, the trend of the social developing, and pricing attractively. To do the promotion, CHINA PUTIAN shall also contribute its efforts to commonweal affairs to maintain good reputation of the corporation among common people who are also the potential customers, and it has done so gradually. Its donation built a Wazijie Project Hope School in Huanglong County of Shaanxi Province. It donated mobile phones of its own brand to model workers from China's western area. It donated relieving fund to the ""Care for the West, Share One Love"" movement. It signed assistance agreements with 2 poverty-stricken counties-Dari and Gande, in Guoluo Prefecture of Qinghai Province. It donated money and material to Anti-SARS related organization. International marketing department: CHINA PUTIAN is keen on developing international markets. Through joint venture, cooperation, and compensation trade, CHINA PUTIAN has established over 90 joint venture companies with 47 companies including world-renowned telecommunication manufacturers from 19 countries and regions. CHINA PUTIAN enjoys long-term strategic partnership with world-renowned telecommunication manufacturers such as Ericsson, Nokia, Panasonic, Motorola, Alcatel, Toshiba, Sanyo, Lucent, NEC, Corning, Nortel, TI, Tellabs, etc. In 2003, the company's total import and export volume is US$ 4.63 billion. Its export volume is US$ 2.16 billion. Its products are sold in dozens of countries and regions such as the U.S., Japan, Finland, Sweden, the U.K., Turkey, United Arab Emirates, India, Nepal, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Cuba, Columbia and etc. So it is an important part for corporation’s development that to communicate and cooperate with the industry members global wide. PUTIAN should also pay greater attention and resources on cooperation with foreign companies. It is committed to expanding its business scope into promising new areas in communications solutions, products and services at home and aboard. Sales department: it is the final step of marketing, which is a point to verify the effects of the work of marketing. The thesis emphasizes on the functions, extension and merit system of these seven parts, and gives living cases to support the design. These cases illustrate different aspects of the marketing function. The functional departments are not working independently, but connecting a lot. In this way, China Putian’s developing strategy can be laid down to the detailed assignments of marketing. At the same time, the various problems and information can be fed back and solved in time, so that, the strategy itself can be supplemented and corrected. The thesis demonstrates the significance of after-sales services. The holding of customers largely relies on the quality of after-sales services, it’s also a course of gaining goodwill for the organization, so after-sales service is an important and complex function. The thesis also discusses the merit system of after-sales service function, and illustrates the merit system of customer-service department of China Putian Hexin Network Communication Technique Corporation to make it practical to China Putian. The thesis then emphasizes on what should be noticed during the setting up of the framework, like the problem of communication hindrances. The marketing framework will have large investment of the resources, and what’s more, may not get immediate effects. So the leading members of China Putian have to voluntarily demonstrate the importance of the framework, and push forward the work of setting up the framework. Marketing function is the most disputed one among all the functions in the corporation, and the decisions makers are rectify their attitudes towards marketing stage by stage. At first, marketing function is just like other functions of personnel, finance, manufacture, afterwards, going along with the development of the corporation, people gradually realize the importance of marketing, and think it should be more important than other functions, and even the core function of the corporation. No marketing, no corporation. Other people regard that customers are the core of the corporation’s living, marketing is the channel connecting the corporation and the customers. And the regards have been believed throughout the world. But in China’s corporations, there is no way to believe marketing as the core of living, include China Putian. China Putian pays much attention on the volume of sales, on the time of payback. Marketing is just so-so, no one is ready to think high of the marketing function. From the view of the ready marketing framework of China Putian, the subordinate functions are set up according to the assignments of the strategy, some of the assignments are rather duplicated, so it makes cooperation much important. But smooth cooperation is rather difficult to get, it needs a common interest among the subordinate functions. The thesis tries to exercise the marketing theories to analyze the sticking point in the marketing function of China Putian, and finally tries to find a way for it.",1026536256, 中国普天信息产业集团公司市场营销组织设计,Dissertations & Theses," Gao, WeiGaoWeiGao, Wei高伟", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2712413681 , 70433822 , 189128 , H159532 , H159532", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国普天信息产业集团公司市场营销组织设计,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026536256?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAIH159532 , Social sciences , 市场营销、组织、、Marketing、Framework、",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Design+of+Marketing+Framework+for+China+PUTIAN+Corporation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gao%2C+Wei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3769,Research on Chinese Culture Domain Development Solution,"Culture domain is the rising one in century 21. Not only the advance of culture industry can promote the culture development, but also make the fortune. It is now the important part and increasing point of our national economy. The nation has exploring abroad on the efforts of domain from 1979, as the principals of contract and be raised by culture itself. Through the advance of two or more decades, we now have some progress but in the period of weakness and have a large step after the economies with capitals and technology level, capability of marketing operation and marketing competition. This text analyses the problems in the area. Exterior- the management of culture of nation was born under the plan economy, it has have lots of disadvantage after several time reforms. Mainly on the aspects of the not very clear responsibilities and rights and benefits between the government and cultural marketing runners in culture control, thus, the runners are not the real one who in charge of the marketing and the corporation. Much interferences of state occur in management. The interconnected system of the funds is chartered and made during the investing of culture construction. The runners can not make any incomes individuals and not have the rights to use funds self-determined, who not have the activities and enthusiasms to make more funds and financing. Due to the united management of government, the administration of cultural and non-industrialization, now our culture projects has a lower efficiency of operation. Non-legalization is also the important characteristics of cultural system. The situation and function can not be confirmed by law. The operation of culture projects is not guaranteed by law indispensable and lacking law certification in cultural activities management. Culture projects development just depend on the focus degree of governors. In interior, the career has lower technologies, talents lacking, fund insufficient, irrationality of configuration, non-good systems of running. Because for a long time we think the culture belongs to sphere of social ideology, researching its development from the view of economy and how making the policies seldom. Furthermore, majority of the art troupes are running by the state, whose has the system of focusing on civilization lightening profits. So the development of our culture career badly disconnect with the demands of the marketing. This text indicates to promote our national culture career, we, first of all, should have a clear acknowledge of the development circumstances. One is the economy globality, the impersonal tendency, which can not only deeply influence the policies and activities of all nations in the world but also have the powers on the culture policies and movements and directions of development, and impact the reorganization of configurations of cultural power and the changes of international culture orders. The other is our policies obviously disaccord and has internal conflicts with the WTO trade freedom, clarity and marketing entry allowed rules. The third is culture worldwide expand, comes the cultural imperialism, which really threaten our national culture domain development. The security situation of national culture becomes worse and worse. And we must fact to the advantages and disadvantages. The nation has vast territory large population, sufficient demand of diversified culture, the biggest culture marketing compare with other nations. She has rich resources of culture- the irreplaceable one, long history culture. Disadvantages are small scales, non-competition abilities and not enough manage experience, can not follow the WTO. To advance, we must deal with the relationship between the career and cultural domain; distinguish strictly from the career with marketing sales measures and domain with thick commonwealth colorful, the relationship between culture system reform and culture domain. Processing culture system reforms mainly with the economy structure adjustments and guided by marketing. Economic benefits and social benefits, the latter is much concerned. The relation of opening and developing, strengthen the protection of folk culture as well heir and creation. And he order of development, lighten characteristics. First well done in certain areas, then radiates and stimulate the zones around advance together. Choose rational direction according to practice. We can adopt following ways to strengthen our culture domain: speed the reform of the system, change the management functions of government, separated from the government. To perfect the present manage and operation systems. The second, to carry out active domain advance policies, setup the system base on the Chinese culture status and demands of culture managing as well as suitable to WTO principles. Open wide the admission level, adjust and reorganize the relation of culture economy profits on the basis of marketing system. Speed up the update frequency of system to meet the modern enterprise principles. Bring the new foreign trade strategy for cultural foreign trade system. Establish the strategies for big pace development of culture domain. Thirdly, talents, we need lots of creative culture professionals. Fourth, expand the international market for rapid progresses. Fifth is the system of national intellective properties protection setup, through which firm the domestic and competitive in overseas. Sixth, build the national culture safety precaution system and enhance the culture safe legislation construction. And should have financing system of culture domain . Thus, the Chinese culture domain can advance good and sustainable, always successful in the competition with world culture industry.",1026552947, 我国文化产业发展对策研究,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Zhong YuZhangYuZhongZhang, Zhong Yu张玉忠", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2712540201 , 70428892 , 189128 , H209253 , H209253", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 我国文化产业发展对策研究,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026552947?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAIH209253 , Social sciences , 文化 文化产业 文化事业Culture  Culture industry  Culture career",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+Chinese+Culture+Domain+Development+Solution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Zhong+Yu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3770,From Marx's Alienation to Georg Lukacs'Reification,"The problem of alienation is a basic problem that Marx considered in his whole life. Even since very early days, Marx had touched on the various phenomena of alienation and kept a conscious mind toward its seriousness and urgency. Marx had not formed the view of alienation during his writing of The Doctor's Thesis and his explanation of alienation had still been limited to Hegel's Philosophy. According to Hegelian theory, alienation primarily refers to the alienation on the spirit, i.e, the absolute idea can be alienated from or get out of nature in its own movement. Marx affirmed the very alienation theory of the essence of spiritual subject as Hegel did and regarded alienation of the spiritual substance (atom) as the natural way in its self-fulfillment, because alienation was exactly objectification and only through objectification could the concrete integrity of essence and existence be realized. During his writing/compiling of “Rheinische Zeitung”, Marx shifted his standpoint of alienation to a new one because of the serious conflict between the problem in practical life and Hegel's Philosophy as well as the great effect of Feuerbach' standpoint of alienation. The conclusion Marx drew from those theories was that reason was the innate character of the world and was expressed by the public opinion and the people's spirit and concentrated by the speech-free publications and the philosophy and then rose to the nation and the law. He asserted that the nation was not the incarnation of the public reason, nor a super-existence beyond the citizenry society, but the alienation of people's political lives. Marxian standpoint of alienation was transformed into humanism in his Criticism for Hegel's Law Philosophy and “About Jewry' Problem”. Marx came to the conclusion: on the one hand, the citizenry society determined the nation; on the other hand, the nation was the alienation of the human being’s nature. The human being would not only exterminate alienation in the thought, but also exterminate the alienation in the actuality, and the proletariat was the very incarnation of power. Marxian theory of alienation took its form as “alienated labor” in Manuscript of Economics and Philosophy in 1844. Marx investigated the properties and the displays of alienated labor from four aspects. First, there was a relation of alienation between a worker and his product. Second, there was a relation of alienation between a worker and his labor. Third, alienation happened in individuals and their human essence. Fourth, because of the relation of alienation between a worker and his product, between a worker and his activity of life, between the worker and his human essence, a direct result of these things is alienation between a man and the other man. Marx explained concretely all kinds of theoretical problems and actual problems. He claimed that human and nature were united, but human labor essence was alienated in the process of objectification, and the relation between human and nature was also the relation of alienation, because the nature was isolated from human being and was opposite to human, and the private possession was the product of alienated labor, and the history was the history of alienation of essence of human labor and the history of sublation of alienation, so communism was historical inevitableness. However, the premise of his theory of alienation was still humanism, because Marx used the species essence of human to stand opposed to the actual human existence, and the labor as the embodiment of human essential power to stand opposed to the alienated labor, therefore, whatever was the viewpoint of human or the viewpoint of human labor would both take the characteristic of the abstract metaphysics. In The Holy Family, Marx began objectively to evaluate alienation phenomenon from the viewpoint of history. Opposition between the proletariat and the bourgeois was made by the system of private ownership, both the proletariat and the bourgeois were objective, historical results of alienations. Only through the extermination of the system of private ownership could alienation phenomenon of capitalism be eradicated. German Ideology marked the birth of historical perspective of materialism and strode to scientific explanation of Marxian theory of alienation. Marx thought that alienation first was a historic phenomenon rather than a pure mental and moral phenomenon. That is to say, the history could be used to explain alienation, but not the vice versa. What pushed the human history forward were not alienation of human species essence and the sublation of alienation, but the development of productive power that led to the change of productive relations. Marx’s manuscripts and the book Capital demonstrated the achievement of scientific ideology of Marxian theory of alienation. Marx claimed that the essence of alienation was that the reified labor governed human beings. Once the sociality of producers’ activities was reified in the form of commutative value and the form of currency, it would become a social power that is opposite to the producers. In his manuscripts and the book, Marx not only revealed with the category of alienation the social oppositeness of capitalism in the profound and supplement way, he also disclosed the historical transition of capitalism and the historical value of the theory of alienation to mankind's emancipation from capitalism. What I interpret Marxian theory of alienation is based on both historical perspective of materialism and the theory of labour value. Mankind not only realizes its own reproduction but also creates and develops the material productive powers through the labour of production. Directly speaking, on the one hand, the human being changes the nature of himself and develops his own physical strength and intelligence as well as accumulates the productive experience and the labour skills; on the other hand, he also creates the new social combinative way of labour. The employment system of capitalism and the mode of realization of value not only obstruct the development of productive powers, but also lead to the alienation of social relation. There were great changes in both the economy and politics of the capitalist society during the end of 19th century and the early part of 20th century, and the problems caused by these changes were waiting for being solved by Marxists. The Second International leaders represented by Edward Bernstein abandoned Hegel's Philosophy which Marx had absorbed some rational factors with appraisal and regarded economy as the only decisive factor while ignoring the relative independent character and the important reaction to the economic basis provided by the superstructure which consisted of politics, ideology and philosophy. To counter the Second International leaders’ worship for the spontaneous theory and their neglect of the major function performed by revolution, George Lukács tendered his bitter attacks and published a book named History and Class Consciousness by compiling his eight papers finished in four years. In the book he deemed that the main cause for the failure of the revolutions in different European countries lied in the crisis in proletarian class consciousness. He proposed to restore the traditional connections between Marxism and Hegel's Philosophy and criticized acutely on the important role played by the proletarian class consciousness. His theory of reification was born in the above-mentioned background. George Lukács combined Max Weber’s theory of rationalization with Marx's analysis of the worship of commodity and advanced the theory of reification that maintained a man’s activity and his labor became the things objective and contradictory to himself in History and Class Consciousness. He claimed that both producer and the relation between producers were reified into the elements of merchandise producing in the employment system in capitalism and the thinking way of reification had already constituted the inside principle of the capitalist philosophy. And reification furthered its influence on ethics and became the unified ideological structure of the whole society. A bureaucrat was subjected to the bureaucratic mechanism and was proud of doing so while a journalist lost his righteousness and made a living by selling his belief and experience, and a capitalist and a worker were the slaves of capital by sacrifice themselves voluntarily to commodities. Lukács pointed out with the aid of analysis that there were two reasons for the formation of reification: the first reason was that in capitalist society the relations between merchandises created an independent world whose laws could be recognized by human beings but couldn’t be changed by them. The world was totally against human being and became the objective foundation of reification. The second one arose in the subjective aspect and was that labor became merchandise as Marxed revealed. Lukács thought that the German classic philosophy had been related to the consciousness of reification at the very beginning ever since Kantianism , which only admitted that the reason method was the unique method of controlling actuality. This philosophy reflected the consciousness construction of reification of capitalist society, which was a form of merchandise in the thought. At the same time, Lukács not only objected to Engels's dialectics of nature and Lenin's theory of reflection, but also criticized that the former expanded dialectics from the realm of reciprocal action of subject and object to the nature realm which contained none of dialectics factors and that the latter was actually simple realism and metaphysical materialism. In order to get rid of reification, Lukács emphasized the dynamic role and the revolutionary practice of proletarian class consciousness and pointed out that Marx's category of totality was the key to extricate the restraint of reification. He claimed that Marx's dialectics found out the uniformed subject and object, that is the proletariat. After attaining the self-conscious class-consciousness, the proletariat can fundamentally change the social reality. Lukács' theory of reification resisted Kantian understanding analysis by using Hegelian dialectical reasonableness and included two latitudes of both objective explanation and subjective criticism on capitalistic mode of production. However, He put generality above the economic basis and overstated the dynamic role played by the consciousness. This assertion not only resembled Hegel's distortion of Marxism but also reflected the trend of extreme “Left” deviation. On the other hand, Lukács did not distinguish between alienation, reification and objectification precisely and he used reification as the synonym of alienation. Therefore, it was impossible for him to enunciate the source of alienation and to find out the way to eliminate alienation. In Marx’s manuscripts and his book Capital, Marx made a clear distinction between alienation and reification. He assumed that there were two kinds of reification: one was the reification of the physical labor in its natural regulations, i.e, the specific kind of concrete physical labor would create certain use value and it was the objectification of physical labor. The other kind of reification was the reification of the physical labor in its social stipulations, i.e., under capitalist conditions, human beings’ physical labor as part of the whole social labor could create certain exchange value. So-called alienation labor occurred in the latter. In his manuscripts and the book, Marx not only revealed with the category of alienation the social oppositeness of capitalism in the profound and supplement way, he also disclosed the historical transition of capitalism and the historical value of the theory of alienation to mankind's emancipation from capitalism. He insisted that the capitalism pushed the alienation to an extreme end meanwhile it helped the history to discard the alienation. Capitalism played a role both in pushing the alienation to an extreme and preparing the mature conditions for the sublation of alienation. Therefore, unlike reification and objectification, which were eternal and inevitable, alienation was just temporary and inevitable. The sublation of alienation was the process in which the old social division would be eliminated on the base of a rapid development of the relation between human being and nature. But its realization depended mainly on the proletariat's conscious practice in reforming the capitalist system.",1027908249, 从马克思的异化理论到卢卡奇的物化理论,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, Bin LiZhouLiBinZhou, Bin Li周立斌", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721221521 , 70433812 , 189128 , H154507 , H154507", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 从马克思的异化理论到卢卡奇的物化理论,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027908249?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAIH154507 , Philosophy, religion and theology , 异化、物化、合理化、alienation、reification、rationalization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Marx%27s+Alienation+to+Georg+Lukacs%27Reification&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Bin+Li&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3771,A Statistical Analysis of the Stock Market's Response to Global Economic Events,"Event studies are among the most successful uses of econometrics in financial markets. By providing a simple process for measuring the impact of events on investor wealth, the method offers a fruitful means for evaluating the implications of significant economical or political events. This paper is an attempt to construct a new frame of event studies. It is, maybe, the first time to use those statistical tools to solve some problems. This paper concentrates on statistical analyses about global economical event from two points of view: on one hand, trying to find factors of the impact to stock return; on the other hand, making research about the interval of the effective impact. There are four chapters which unfold as follows: Chapter 1 describes the background of event studies. The efficient market theory (EMF) is introduced first, including the basic concept, analysis frame, its relation to kinds of statistical models and tests, and so on. Later, we show the primary matters of event study, emphasizing its relation to EMF. Some basic definitions are also provided in this chapter. Chapter 2 contributes descriptive statistical analysis of the data. Some necessary data adjustment is put on to make the following analysis more convincible. What’s more, some other basic definitions are provided here. Chapter 3 is one focus of the paper. In order to analyze the return under the effective impact, two kinds of models are applied. The first is transfer function models, which are used to investigate the joint dynamics of price changes and volume on the stock markets. To present the influence of effective impact, we just make some simple correction to these models. As most time series analysis of financial data, GARCH model is employed to correct the residuals. The second is ordinary leaner models, which are familiar with most readers. Some important conclusions are maintained in this chapter. n	The movement direction of the stock price can not be predicted by using the information of the history price and volume. n	The magnitude of the movement of the stock price can , to some extent, be predicted by using the information of the history price and volume. …… Chapter 4 focuses on another center of this paper, which is the interval of the effective impact. General count models and Survival models are widely used in social science areas, such as analysis of wars, strike, plague, insurrection and the life of equipment or humans. These give us some clues to carry on our research. However, some transforms are necessary, which includes: n	Division of the time series and the independence of the effective impact; n	Choice of the risk factor; n	Introduce of censoring conception. There are also some important conclusions abtained in this chapter. We find two useful explanatory variables contribute to the analysis of this chapter, which is the average magnitude of price change and the standard error of the volume on the past stage. In addition, the following statistical tools are used in this paper: transfer function model, ordinary regression model, survival model, GARCH model, dummy-variable method, residual analysis, ARCH test, survival distributions.",1027908311, 全局经济事件对股票市场冲击的统计分析,Dissertations & Theses," Zheng, DongZhengDongZheng, Dong郑冬", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721221641 , 70481222 , 189128 , H154410 , H154410", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 全局经济事件对股票市场冲击的统计分析,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027908311?accountid=14496, 0463 Statistics, 0463 Statistics, 0463 Statistics,, 0463 Statistics, Statistics," (UMI)AAIH154410 , Pure sciences , 事件分析、生存模型、时间序列、event study、survival models、time series",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Statistical+Analysis+of+the+Stock+Market%27s+Response+to+Global+Economic+Events&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zheng%2C+Dong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3772,Study on Regulation Reform of Water Supply Industry in China,"In the whole world, especially western developed country, the natural monopoly industry is going through a regulation reform. People realize more and more soberly that under the traditional regulation system, the operation of the natural monopoly industry is in charge of too widely and tightly, which have caused a lot of drawbacks hindered the sound development of the natural monopoly industry. So the countries all over the world have carried on the reform to the regulation of the natural monopoly industry in varying degrees. Regulation is reformed along two ways at the present time: Firstly, adopt the policy of the relaxed regulation, cancel the regulation clause in part or in whole, and introduce the competition mechanism of the market. For example, An open and important reform had been carried out to the regulation of the communication and transportation business in the U.S.A, through the issue of a series of bills successively from 1976 to 1982, such as “Law of Railway Rejuvenation and Railway Regulation Reform”, “Relaxed Regulation Law of Passenger Traffic of Aviation”, “Law of Automobile Transportation”, “railway law” etc. And in Britain, there are privatizing and relaxed regulation movements on a large scale to the telecommunication, coal gas, water supply, electricity and railway transportation in the beginning of the eighties of the 20th century. Other country like Germany, Australia, and Japan had also carried on the regulation reform one after the other. Secondly, improve the existing regulation and introduce the encouraging regulation to promote the operation of economic regulation more rationally and more effectively. According to the theory of new regulation economics, it’s the commission- agent relationship between the governor and regulated enterprises. Difficulties in regulation are the information asymmetry. Encouraging regulation is designed in the way of self-choose of the regulated enterprises in order to utilize privately owned information better and achieve the goal of raising the efficiency. The regulation organization can make the best weighing between efficiency and other social goals in the encouraging regulation. The western developed counties have made very good result to the regulation reform, which is carried on to the characteristic of the natural monopoly industry, the improvement of the business efficiency and service quality of the natural monopoly industry, great reduction of the cost and price and the increase of the social welfare. It has a very strong demonstration effect. And with the deepening of the market economic system reform with Chinese characteristics, drawbacks of natural monopoly industry developed under the traditional system expose day by day, such as the low management, poor service quality and serious investment insufficiency. So reform to it becomes more and more important and urgent. In recent years, our country has already begun in industry's relaxed regulation reform has already begun in China in some natural monopoly industries, such as telecommunication, electricity, aviation and railway, etc. and also have made the positive result. These domestic and international successful experiences have proved from practices that relaxed regulation and introduction of competition is of great importance to the development of natural monopoly in China. As a typical natural monopoly industry, the regulation reform of our water supply industry lags behind obviously compared with other natural monopoly industries, such as electricity, telecommunication and so on, so it is urgently to deepen the regulation reform of our water supply industry. Under this background, this paper will apply the governmental regulation theory on natural monopoly industries to analyze the reform practice of our water supply industry, so it has a very important practice meaning. This paper mainly uses the governmental regulation theory on natural monopoly industries to make a systematic research on the regulation reform of our water supply industry. In this paper, through the analysis of current situation and issues of some contents of our governmental regulation on water supply industry, such as the legal frame, the operating mechanism of current regulation system, the price regulation, the quality regulation, the market-enter regulation, the investment regulation, etc. Some policy recommendations will be put forward to deepen the regulation reform of our water supply industry further. Though the suggestions in this paper have been put in practice in the other natural monopoly industries, the suggestions are still important and meaningful for the water supply industry. In this paper I mainly learn from the experience of the regulation reform in British, which show the shortcoming of this paper. Though there are so many researches in the natural monopoly industries, I will be very delighted with my contribution to the regulation reform in water supply industry.",1027911194, 中国供水产业规制改革研究,Dissertations & Theses," Zou, Nan HuiZouHuiNanZou, Nan Hui邹慧男", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721255591 , 70481192 , 189128 , H111335 , H111335", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国供水产业规制改革研究,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027911194?accountid=14496, 0438 Environmental economics, 0438 Environmental economics, 0438 Environmental economics,, 0438 Environmental economics, Environmental economics," (UMI)AAIH111335 , Social sciences , 自然垄断、供水产业、规制、Natural Monopoly、Water supply、Regulation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+Regulation+Reform+of+Water+Supply+Industry+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zou%2C+Nan+Hui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3773,A Study on Korean Administrative Reform of Kim Dae-Jumg Government,"The strong impact of the financial crisis in the latter half of 1997 left Republic of Korea in its biggest economic disaster ever since World War II: slump in the stock market, inflation of currency, shutdown of factories, roaring rate of unemployment, rapid decrease in foreign exchange, and the country was at the verge of a tumble down. At the height of the financial crisis, in February 1998, Mr. Kim Dae-jung vowed in as the 15th president of the Republic of Korea. Having strived all his life for political reform in South Korea, Mr. Kim Dae-jung assumed responsibility at a critical time. During his presidency, Kim adopted a series of comprehensive reforms in finance, enterprises, labor-capital structure, public sectors and so on, determined to end the trusteeship of International Monitory Fund (IMF) within one year and a half. The amazing thing was that the series of measures adopted by Kim Government took effect, successfully stopping the financial as well as social crisis and regained people’s confidence in the government. Korea thus became the first Eastern Asian nation to recover from the economic crisis. The outstanding achievements call for international attention on the reforms. The administrative reform is the object of this paper. Through research, the author attempts to answer the following questions: what is the background of the administrative reform of Kim Dae-jung Government (Chapter I)? What are the contents, progress and achievements of Korean Administrative reform (ChapterII-IV)? What are the factors concerning the results of the administrative reform (Chapter V)? And what are the lessons that can be learned from Korean experience for the theory and practice of administrative reform (Chapter VI)? The world’s past and present experiences have told us that there are always domestic or international backgrounds behind all administrative reforms. For Korea, the 1997 financial crisis served as the biggest and most direct external cause for administrative reform while domestically, the frequent change of power leads to the reform. In the December 1997 election, Kim Dae-jung was chosen as the 15th president, a first out-party president in the history of South Korea. History has it that when power switches from one side to another, administrative reform will definitely become part of the political promises because administrative reform is the political image of a politician. In addition, the 1997 financial crisis provided a good political reason for Kim Government’s administrative reform. In order to overcome the crisis, South Korean had to accept the trusteeship of International Monetary Fund. On receiving a 60 billion U.S. Dollar emergency loan, Korean had to accept rigorous conditions such as to slow down economic growth, increase tax rate and cut back government expenditures. The historical national crisis created a consensus among the Koreans to have an necessary administrative reform, which effectively reduced the barriers to the reform. On the other hand, the key internal cause for the reform would be the reconsideration on the weakness of the traditional government management model. Korean government oriented economic development model had dated back to the 1960`s. It was to accelerate the national economy and to implement the strategy and plan for a fast catch-up. Honesty speaking, such a development model was crucial for Korean economy to take off and grow from lack of resource and an extremely backward economic infrastructure. But its weak points are exposed with the change in international environment and development in domestic economy and society: the occurrence of plutocracy, a fragile financial system, collusion between government officials and business people and the spread of corruption brought about by the centralized political system. All these lead to a decrease in its international competitiveness and the outbreak of the financial crisis. Also since 1970’s, the new public management campaign beginning in some Western developed nations such as the U.S. and the U.K. had a “media effect” on Korea. The theory of new public management and the practice of reform measures adopted by Western nations in countering the malpractice of traditional bureaucracy have not only provided a solid foundation and abundant experiences for Korea to set guidelines, targets and methods for the reform but also become the external pressure for reform. Just like the Western developed nations, Korean administrative reform takes the idea of new public management as the guiding principle for the reform. But the reform was not simply for the crisis caused problems. To a greater extend, it was designed for the improvement of a market economy oriented system, for the enhancement of national power and for a basis of a sustained after-crisis development. For sake of this, Kim Dae-jung Government set the goal of establishing a “small and efficient, service oriented government”. Reforms in three areas are initiated to achieve this goal: restructuring of public sectors, reform in administrative operation system and the construction of a service oriented government. More concretely, in terms of public sector restructuring, the goal would be to establish “small government”. Reforms include institutional restructuring, redundancy, privatization of state owned enterprises, out-contracting of government projects, readjustment and management upgrading of government funded institutions and the accountability of the central and local governments. Indicators have shown a smooth progress of Kim Government’s restructuring, and the reforms live up to their expectations. Of all the reforms, the results of redundancy and the privatization of state owned enterprises are most outstanding: the number of government officials in 2002 dropped back to that of 10 years before; the privatization of 74 state-owned-enterprises reduced the range of public sector and increased fiscal income of the country, providing large capitals for a next step reform. Short-term goals have been achieved in coordinating the responsibilities of central and local governments, delegating more rights and duties to the local level. This laid an institutional foundation for the efficiency and responsiveness of governance. The three-step institutional readjustment played its positive role in strengthening the adjusting ability of the economy, and the role of social management. Additionally, as an auxiliary measure of the institutional readjustment, out-contracting of government projects, reform of government funded institutions have also become an important part of the “small government”. Admittedly, influenced by the political environment, some of the designed reform projects are abused and some demolished institutions resumed. In terms of the reform in the system of administrative operation, the Korean Government adopted such systems as the system of responsibility operation department, the system of liberalized employment and the system of performance-salary, and these consequently promoted the reform in personnel engagement and management. By the end of 2002, Kim Dae-jung Government has had a total of 23 responsibility operation departments and 119 employed officials for the open enlisting. Also, the performance-salary system has been applied in almost all departments of central government and majority of autonomous regions. The reform in personnel engagement and management is not limited within government administrative departments, but has extended to the retained state-owned enterprises and research institutions directly under the government. Tangible improvements have also been made in the reform of fiscal operation system: decisive adjustment has been made to cancel or merge some 35 foundations and supervision and control have been strengthened over all other foundations; at all levels of governments sectors, there is the system of reward for prudent budgets; the trial system of performance prediction has been going on in 39 institutions. But one important topic facing Korea is more adjustment and improvement on the reforms because institutional abuse and boycott of some government officials have occurred. The Korean Government has adopted many measures as well in improving its service function and constructing a service-oriented government. The measures are as follows: the legalization of administrative service has been adopted widely at the central and local level governments; results are apparent in rectifying quasi-taxations, relieving at least 300 billion Korean dollars of burden on the Koreans; with an extensive opinion poll and a thorough investigation, the government conducted reform in the most unsatisfying 15 sectors in the following 7 areas including: police, housing, transportation, education, environment, social security and employment, food and hospitals. This has contributed to improving the administrative service. Also, in terms of establishing e-governance and legal reform, the performance of the Korean Government has also been accredited internationally. The reforms have not only greatly improved the quality of service, raised and enhanced government competitiveness and performance, constructed information infrastructure, but also fought corruption, advocated for proper governance and increased operational transparency. Then, how to evaluate the administrative reform of Kim Government? The actual effect of administrative reform does not surface shortly afterwards, and the multi-significance reform means differently to varied values, standards etc. So this article prudently judges the Kim Reforms. The author analyzes the progress of the reform measures to see how the targets are reached. Because administrative reforms affect political images, the author has also taken as important rating standards the people’s recognition towards the reform concept and reform direction in the late Kim period. As for reference, the author has also considered the comments by OECD and other international organizations, the growth rate, foreign exchange reserve, average income, Korean sovereignty credit rating and its international competitiveness. The general rating by the author is that: progress has been made by the Kim Dae-jung Government in administrative reform, most reform targets have been achieved, the reforms contributed to surviving the financial crisis and has laid a good foundation for the country’s sustainable development. These results followed the strategic choices including: the rationality of the concepts (which are different from the traditional administrative models and improve the government’s competitiveness), the strongly willed president, and the extensive support, participation, understanding and compassion of all Koreans from top government leaders to ordinary people, the reform being an overall and scheduled one, institutions for ensuring the progress of the reforms, the rationality and transparency of the decision making process ensured by the government-people cooperation mechanism, and the insurance promoted and provided by legislation. But judging from the current results, defects still exist. Causes are many, but a selected few are included to analyze the theory of the institutions. After reviewing performance-salary system, liberalized employment system, responsibility operation departments system and regulation reform, analysis is given on the impact of informal institutions on the reform. The results show that it’s those informal institutions countering the reform concept that kept some reform measures down or even abused. With the above explanations, the author got the following conclusion concerning the theory and practice of Kim’s reform: the adaptability of new public management concept. Against the backdrop of globalization and informatization and with the urgent need to deal with the traditional bureaucracy, it is admittedly beneficial to learn from international experiences in new public management movement. But a nation’s political system as well as such informal institutions as culture, values and traditions and customs should be given full attention to while deciding the targets, contents and strategies of the reforms. An appropriate change in the system will save time and energy in realizing the basic goals for the nation’s development and construction. The second is the improvement and development of the theory and analysis framework of the system. Because administrative reform is a de facto man-made government rearrangement process which can be explained by new institutionalism. Meanwhile, it is necessary to improve and develop the definition, function, formation and alteration of the institution. With the constraints of time and space, it becomes the focus and difficulty to research on the dynamic relationship between the structures and behaviors of the institutions. The third questions concerns the uncertainty of administrative reform and the choice of reform strategies. Kim’s reforms have told us that some of the reform results can be predicted while others not, even with our limited rationality. In other words, it could be unavoidable to have “obsolete”, “unsuitable” or even “abused” reform measures. So it is an important method to choose gradual and democratic reform strategies to effectively solve this uncertainty.",1027911197, 韩国金大中政府行政改革研究,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Feng XiuLiXiuFengLi, Feng Xiu李秀峰", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721255651 , 70433822 , 189128 , H111974 , H111974", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 韩国金大中政府行政改革研究,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027911197?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAIH111974 , Social sciences , 韩国、金大中、行政改革、Korean、Kim Dae-Jumg、Administrative Reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+on+Korean+Administrative+Reform+of+Kim+Dae-Jumg+Government&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Feng+Xiu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3774,Rent-seeking Theory and Analysis of the Rent-seeking Activities in State Owned Commercial Bank in China,"Rent seeking theory appeared in 1960s. In spite of short history, this theory has developed very quickly. Further more, rent seeking theory break through the limited area of traditional economic theory. It has combined with politics, sociology and culture research. Rent seeking theory develops the research area of economics and enhanced the power of economics to explain reality. From broad sense, rent seeking refers to nonproductive profit-seeking activities, or the nonproductive activities to keep vested economic interest as well as to redistribute the vested interest. From the narrow sense, rent seeking refers to utilizing political and law instrument to block the free flow and competence of producing factors among different industry so as to keep vested interest. Of course, there are many disputes to the definition of rent seeking. Running down the developing history of rent seeking theory, we can find although classical economists (such as Say) has discussed this question, they didn’t establish the system info of rent seeking. In 1967 Tullock put forward the basic idea of rent seeking. In his paper ’The Welfare Costs of Tariff, Monopolies, and Theft’, Tullock analyzed monopoly’s influence on social welfare. According to him, monopoly’s social cost should include the resources wasted during competing for monopoly except ‘Harberger triangle’, which is called ‘Tullock rectangle’. ‘Tullock rectangle’ is the social cost of rent seeking. But in this paper, Tullock didn’t put forward the concept of “rent seeking’. At that time, rent seeking theory only had a small influence in theory circle. In 1974 Krueger set up the full frame of rent seeking theory in his paper ‘The Political Economy of the Rent-Seeking Society’. He used the concept of ‘rent seeking’ at the first time. From then on, rent-seeking theory has aroused wide recognition in economic theory circle. Just for this reason many economist consider that Krueger is the real inaugurator of rent seeking theory. Tullock and Krueger inaugurated two different creeds of rent seeking theory, which is public choice creed and international trade creed. Public choice creed is based on the rent seeking theory of public choice school (Tullock and Buchanan are the main spokesman of public choice school). While collective choice school (represented by Olson) and New Institutional economic School (represented by North) developed rent-seeking theory along the public choice creed. Bhagwati made great contribution to the development of international trade creed. He summarized the rent seeking theory heretofore and put forward the concept of Directly Unproductive Profit-seeking Activity. Then rent-seeking theory is used in more expansive area. Hereafter the international trade school of rent seeking theory uses DUP in most time, while the public choice school continues to use the word’ rent seeking’. The integrated analysis to rent seeking theory should include the following five aspects: the person factor analysis, the institution factor analysis, the process analysis, the consequence analysis, the theoretical contribution and utilizing value of rent seeking theory. The person factor analysis emphasized on analyzing the applicability of economic man hypothesis. The body analyzed by rent seeking theory should be limited rational economic man who is opportunistic. This hypothesis should be applied to bureaucracy, too. Rent seeking activity is the outcome of given institution environment. Government has natural extrusion trend to marketing, which is the institution root for rent seeking activities. As regards the process of rent seeking, there are two different routes for rent seeking activity: the first is that government officers seek for rent on their own initiative, they ask for rent to the potential rent seeking body by tempting or threatening. This is a game process between the government officer and the rent seeking body. Rent seeking activity has strong domino effect of self-copying and self-extending. Just for this reason, once rent-seeking activity appeared it would have the trend of expanding continuously. Rent seeking activities lead to great waste of social resources, reduce the productive efficiency and distort the social incentive mechanism. For developing countries, rent-seeking activities would also block the system reform. Rent seeking theory has great academic significance and application value. It has breakthrough the research area of traditional economic theory. Rent seeking theory divides the economic activity into two different classes: productive activity and unproductive activity. It also differentiates rent seeking activity and profit seeking activity. Rent seeking theory has been widely applied in many areas. Rent seeking theory especially is used to analyze the transition process of developing countries. The state owed commercial bank in our country plays an important role in the economic development. But for the speciality of these banks plenty of rent seeking activities appeared in the reform course. It is very important to master the movement law of rent seeking activities and give out the countermeasures. The rent seeking activities in state owed commercial bank in our country can be divided into two different types according to the participants. One is rent seeking activities implemented by commercial banks. As the main body of market, these banks carry out rent seeking activities by lobbying or bribing government administrator. It is mainly displayed in three aspects: rent seeking activities in the appointment of super administrators of commercial banks, rent seeking activities to the superior administration department in the operations of commercial banks business; rent seeking activities to evade the supervision from the supervision department. The other kind of rent seeking activity refers to the rent seeking activity performed by the economic body outside state owed commercial banks, which is also displayed in three aspects: rent seeking activities in loan examination and approval, rent seeking activities in the personnel employment of state owned commercial banks, rent seeking activities performed by local government. The existence of these rent-seeking activities can be attributed to the following reasons. First, the speciality of state owned commercial bank is the root reason of rent seeking activities in this region. State owned commercial banks, as independent interest body, would like to pursue rent from government; While administrator’s pursuing self interest maximization would lead to rent seeking activities to banks. Second, overmuch government control expanded the room for rent seeking activities; Third, the special relationship between state owned commercial bank and local government is also one important cause for rent seeking activities. The rent seeking activities in state owned commercial bank have caused great adverse influence to economy development of our country. We can find this clearly from the following aspects: first, plenty of non-performing loans are the direct social consequence of rent seeking activities in the state owned commercial banks. Second, the group with vested interest, which is formed in the course of rent seeking, has blocked the course of the reform of state owned commercial bank. Third, rent-seeking activities have led to low diathesis of bank stuff. Last, the low efficiency in capital collocating influenced the efficiency of economy greatly. Of course, some kind of rent seeking activity would push on the reform course of state owned commercial bank, which are favorable from final consequence. Ti is a long term to father the rent seeking activities in state owned commercial bank. We must nail down the economic man hypothesis firstly. We should take action from the following aspects to father the first kind of rent seeking activity: First, strengthen the administration system reform of state owned commercial bank, to set up canonical loan examination and approval system and stuff employment system so as to enhance the cost of rent seeking. Second, to set up reasonable incentive mechanism and wash out mechanism, so as to decrease the expect income of rent seeking. Third, strengthen the inner and outside supervision mechanism, so as to cut off the self-copy and self-swelling process of rent seeking activities. For the second kind of rent seeking activity, it is necessary to take stock system reform. With the introduction of non-state capital, the proprietor can function better. The administrator of bank should be appointed by the directorate of bank. Stock-option system should be taken for bank administrators. At the same time, government should reduce its control over the operation of state owned commercial bank so that banks could perform business innovation independently according to the market environment. Bank supervision department should change from government organization to guild, which would take action according to market mechanism.",1027911209, 寻租理论与我国国有商业银行体系的寻租问题研究,Dissertations & Theses," Qiu, Rui ZhaoQiuZhaoRuiQiu, Rui Zhao邱兆锐", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721255741 , 70481262 , 189128 , H110731 , H110731", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, Chinese, Chinese, 寻租理论与我国国有商业银行体系的寻租问题研究,2004,PQDT - Global,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027911209?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH110731 , Social sciences , 寻租、国有商业银行、政府管制、Rent-seeking、State owned Commercial Bank、Government Control",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rent-seeking+Theory+and+Analysis+of+the+Rent-seeking+Activities+in+State+Owned+Commercial+Bank+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Qiu%2C+Rui+Zhao&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3775,The transplantation of theatre-in-education from britain to taiwan,"The British-born Theatre-in-Education (TIE) is now an international phenomenon. Theatre and education practitioners worldwide have come to recognise TIE as an important resource for the reinforcement of institutional or orthodox education. In Taiwan, by way of cultural exchanges and in accordance with the practice of the well meant, but not so well planned education reforms, TIE has also been gradually adopted by drama specialists and professional theatre groups over the last decade to provide young students with alternative experiences of active learning. During this process of transplantation, the representation of TIE has become an issue that demands careful deliberation in the island. This dissertation surveys the development of Theatre-in-Education in Taiwan from a personal perspective, as well as demonstrating the interdisciplinary relationship between TIE and regional/community theatre through a case study on the encounter of the Greenwich and Lewisham Young People’s Theatre (GYPT) and the Tainan Jen Theatre Troupe. By making use of first-hand experience of TIE transplantation (from Britain to Taiwan) and of interviews with TIE practitioners, the author intends to contextualise the Taiwanese TIE movement by relating it to an international trend of audience-oriented theatre. Within this framework, the author argues that the localisation of British TIE in Taiwan is best embodied, and therefore can be expected to find strength in the association of TIE and those Taiwanese theatre groups of or with a community-friendly nature; in addition, the continuing social, cultural and educational reforms will create a better environment for the growth of Theatre-in-Education in the island.",1221968708,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsai, Chi-changTsaiChi-changTsai, Chi-chang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2832400201 , 45027191 , 101309 , U578566 , U578566", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1221968708?accountid=14496, 0273 Art education, 0273 Art education, 0273 Art education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0273 Art education, Art education," 539877 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+transplantation+of+theatre-in-education+from+britain+to+taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsai%2C+Chi-chang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3776,European nuclear disarmament: a study of transnational social movement strategy,"This thesis is a study of an attempt to help create a transnational movement against the nuclear arms race and the Cold War in the 1980s. The attempt began with the drafting and launch of the Appeal for European Nuclear Disarmament in early 1980. The thesis describes and analyses the work of the British group, European Nuclear Disarmament, or END, which was founded in order to further the aims outlined in the Appeal. The thesis examines END's work in three, overlapping, geographical areas: Britain, where END acted mainly as a pressure group on and/or ginger group within CND in an attempt to internationalize - END-ize - its work; in Western Europe (including Britain), where END (with other Western peace groups) was trying to create and sustain enduring ties amongst Western peace groups; and across the East-West divide, where END was one of a number of groups that engaged in dialogue with independent forces in the Soviet bloc - while maintaining relations with the regimes - with the aim of creating some kind of pan-European alliance that would bring together above all these forces and Western peace groups. The study is conducted in terms of an explanatory framework that emphasizes the pre-existing networks out of which END emerged; the distinctive END worldview or 'frame' and the ways in which END supporters campaigned in its terms, tried to persuade others to adopt it, and/or adapted it - above all in dialogue with independent groups in the Soviet bloc; the resources and structure that helped determine the work END activists could do; the way in which this campaigning was shaped by END's relationship with other peace groups, in Britain above all CND; and the political opportunities and constraints that END activists faced. To date there has been no full-length study of END nor one that analyses the various dimensions of its campaign and how they shaped each other.

This thesis demonstrates that, far from being passive actors in the 'modernisation' of the country, women created alternative spaces from which to voice their views and their demands.  Thus, in order to understand the importance and potential of the 'public sphere' in relation to the early Meiji period, I have used as my theoretical background the works of those female scholars who have developed Jürgen Habermas' theories to define women' s entrance into, and formation of, the public sphere.  I looked at the new professions opened to Japanese women, such as teaching and medicine, at the new public spaces in which they could be found, such as girls' schools and women's groups, and at the ways in which they established links with Western women and learned more about their movements and struggles. My thesis shows how the early Meiji years can be described as the period in which feminism became thinkable.  Only a few women were able to formulate thoroughly feminist theories in their writings or take an active part in pursuing their demands.  Nevertheless, and for the first time in Japanese history, they could start voicing thoughts in public settings by asking for more public space and participation in society while supporting the nationalistic ideology of educated mothers and wives.",1770028112,,Dissertations & Theses," Patessio, MaraPatessioMaraPatessio, Mara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3969650951 , 44980541 , 101309 , U198417 , U198417", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770028112?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIU198417 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+and+the+public+sphere+in+the+early+meiji+period&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patessio%2C+Mara&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3778,Italian anarchists in london (1870-1914),"This thesis is a study of the colony of Italian anarchists who found refuge in London in the years between the Paris Commune and the outbreak of the First World War. The first chapter is an introduction to the sources and to the main problems analysed. The second chapter reconstructs the settlement of the Italian anarchists in London and their relationship with the colony of Italian emigrants. Chapter three deals with the activities that the Italian anarchists organised in London, such as demonstrations, conferences, and meetings. It likewise examines the ideological differences that characterised the two main groups in which the anarchists were divided: organisationalists and anti-organisationalists. Italian authorities were extremely concerned about the danger represented by the anarchists. The fourth chapter of the thesis provides a detailed investigation of the surveillance of the anarchists that the Italian embassy and the Italian Minster of Interior organised in London by using spies and informers. At the same time, it describes the contradictory attitude held by British police forces toward political refugees. The following two chapters are dedicated to the analysis of the main instruments of propaganda used by the Italian anarchists: chapter five reviews the newspapers they published in those years, and chapter six reconstructs social and political activities that were organised in their clubs. Chapter seven examines the impact that the outbreak of First World Word had on the anarchist movement, particularly in dividing it between interventionists and anti-interventionists; a split that destroyed the network of international solidarity that had been hitherto the core of the experience of political exile.

The fall of communism in Poland in 1989 initiated a process of total social transformation, resulting in tensions between positive developments, including civil liberties and the market economy, and the high social costs associated with these changes.  A deep crisis of identity, arising from consumer culture, social fragmentation, uncertainty about the future and the growing number of conflicts of interest, are some of the outcomes that deeply affect the Polish ethos.  The religious sphere of Polish life did not remain unchanged as new trends and religious awareness emerged that can be best described in terms of the shift from the ‘Folk-Church’ to the ‘Church of Choice’. The Polish Church emerged as completely unprepared to face the new reality.  Thus, learning from global shifts in mission in the light of restrictive elements of ‘theology of the second world’ concerns more than the issues of survival.  It is a mission call for change and theological renewal in Poland.  On the basis of the critical analysis of the context, informed by broader perspectives of the global mission movement, it becomes clear that what the Polish Church requires is not just a change of methodology in mission, but rather a much deeper change, namely, development of a new holistic approach to mission imbedded in community.  From this arise three aspects of such a missional community:  a Community of Love, a Community of Word and Life, and a Community of Transformation. These, when dynamically integrated, form a valid, contextually relevant and missionally transformation vision of Church-in-mission, capable of beginning to respond to some of the main challenges arising in the post-communist context.",1811938156,,Dissertations & Theses," Kowalewski, Wojciech KarolKowalewskiKarolWojciechKowalewski, Wojciech Karol", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4149648111 , 107149442 , 101309 , U201459 , U201459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811938156?accountid=14496, 0319 Clerical studies, 0319 Clerical studies, 0319 Clerical studies, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0319 Clerical studies, Clerical studies," (UMI)AAIU201459 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+theology+of+mission+for+post-communist+poland%3A+towards+an+integrative+approach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kowalewski%2C+Wojciech+Karol&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3780,"Narratives of place, culture and identity: second-generation Greek-Americans return 'home'. (BL: DXN067821)","The thesis explores the phenomenon of 'return migration' in Greece through the settlement and identification processes of second-generation Greek-American returning migrants.  It examines the meanings attached to the experience of return migration as they relate to and impact on the returnees' sense of self and sense of place.  The concepts of 'home' and 'belonging' figure prominently in the return migratory project which entails relocation and displacement as well as adjustment and alienation of bodies and selves.  Furthermore, the thesis considers the multiple interactions (social, cultural, political) between the place of origin and the place of destination; network ties; historical and global forces in the shaping of return migrant behaviour; and expression of identity.  The human geography of return migration extends beyond geographic movement into a diasporic journey involving (re)constructions of homeness and belongingness in the ancestral homeland. Return migration as process of relocation of both bodies and selves involves a disruptive space in terms of how culture is articulated in the ancestral homeland, expressive of national time and place.  The disruption involves a reassessment of relationships to both 'home' and 'host' countries.  The politics of space and of identity construct encounters of rupture when dimensions of 'nostalgia' in the lives of migrants attempt to forge a connection between 'imagined' notions of the ancestral homeland and the current 'pragmatic' trends in modern Greece.  Ultimately, the documentation of the tribulations experienced during the return adjustment reflects a process of cultural adjustment and reveals insights into the dynamics of the understood self and the perceived other. Through the analysis of the ethnographic and other material, return migration in the second-generation emerges as a multi-faceted process that profoundly impacts on returnees' identities.  Return migration is a highly complex yet illuminating aspect of migrant subjectivities and its study should be contextualised within specific social, cultural and political references.  That is, life stories of return migrants are directly related to the modern history of the nation and therefore become and integral part of the history of the nation.",301601872,,Dissertations & Theses," Christou, A.ChristouA.Christou, A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760182441 , 45007551 , 101309 , U171663 , U171663", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301601872?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," DXN067821 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Narratives+of+place%2C+culture+and+identity%3A+second-generation+Greek-Americans+return+%27home%27.+%28BL%3A+DXN067821%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Christou%2C+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3781,Is there a new trade union internationalism?  The ICFTU and the campaign for core labour standards in the WTO.,"This thesis investigates the extent to which a 'new' trade union or labour internationalism (NLI) has emerged since the end of the Cold War.  Employing an historical case study approach using primary and secondary documents, participant observation, and interviews with trade union officials and NGO workers, the thesis compares and contrasts the 'old labour internationalism' (OLI) of the Cold War era, with the contemporary activities of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).  The study specifically focuses on how the ICFTU constructed and pursued its main campaign between 1996 and 2001 for the inclusion of core labour standards in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) - the social clause.  The thesis argues that since the end of the Cold War, the ICFTU has undergone a difficult process of political, financial and organisational retrenchment, reorganisation and modernisation.  Its priorities have moved away from geo-politics towards addressing the impact of neo-liberal globalisation on trade unions worldwide.  It had professionalised its campaigning and lobbying capabilities, entered into closer alliances with labour NGOs, and attempted to involve its mass membership in its activities for the first time.  It has also partially opened up its decision-making structures to greater internal scrutiny and democratic participation, and relates to other international trade union bodies in a less hierarchical and territorial way. However, this enforced modernisation does not equate with a transformation, tentative or radical, towards a NLI.  Its adoption of the social clause campaign was primarily for reasons of institutional self-interest, and as a strategy towards globalisation it repeated it classic re-regulation approach to the world economy.  Its new symbolic orientation to alliance building and membership mobilisation is a largely strategic manoeuvre - its methodological spine remains rooted in its traditional elite lobbying approach and hostility to non-labour NGOs and social movements.  The thesis concludes that the ICFTU's core ideology, methodology and structures are strongly embedded in the discredited OLI model of the Cold War, but that internal and external pressures are forcing it to try to capture the new discourses and symbolic practices of labour internationalism.  Put succinctly, the ICFTU is at critical turning point in its history, rooted in and constrained by its past, but increasingly challenged to adapt and change to the challenges of the present and future.",301617001,,Dissertations & Theses," Hodkinson, S.N.HodkinsonS.N.Hodkinson, S.N.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760501901 , 45048291 , 101309 , U195063 , U195063", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301617001?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," DXN089396 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Is+there+a+new+trade+union+internationalism%3F%C2%A0+The+ICFTU+and+the+campaign+for+core+labour+standards+in+the+WTO.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hodkinson%2C+S.N.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3782,"Autonomy and development in zapatista territory:: land management, conflict and ngo-involvement in autonomous municipalities in chiapas, mexico","This thesis is based on fieldwork among Mexican indigenous peasants organised in the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) as well as among international solidarity activists and NGO workers based on the Chiapanec highland town of San Cristóbal.  The investigation covers the development of local autonomy in Zapatista controlled spaces and the role NGOs played in the creation of independent institutions associated with education, health and production.  The establishment of Zapatista autonomy was accompanied by conflicting interests between the EZLN seeking to strengthen its local power-base by using NGO-provided development and local communities trying to establish ties with outsiders that ensured them a privileged access to goods and services. The covered topics include the administration of the terrains occupied in the course of the 1994 uprising, communal forms of resource generation as well as decision-making processes in the rebel communities.  Political division in the communities with a Zapatista presence is another focus of the thesis.  I found that the conflict over resources often resulted in an increased cohesion among individuals within the opposing groups which allowed them to realise collective projects that had hitherto been prevented by discord. In the ten years after the uprising, networks of NGOs had established themselves in San Cristóbal coordinating a growing flow of aid for local Zapatista communities.  I sketch out the processes that left only those NGOs operating in rebel territory which brought their activities in line with the wishes of the EZLN by supporting the consolidation of Zapatista autonomy.  With an increase in networking, a trend of labour division developed in the NGO sector whereby small local groups with strong ties to the communities conceived and implemented the projects in close cooperation with local Indígenas who were to benefit from them.  I particularly focus on local NGOs specialised in the training of volunteers, indigenous health promoters and the provision of basic services, which was just what the autonomous municipalities needed to keep up and expand on the de facto autonomy they had achieved in the years since the uprising. Addressing the allegation that development, albeit alternative and community controlled, accelerates the process of capitalist transformation in the region, I come to the conclusion that, while this might actually be the case, it can also simply empowerment and an inclusion into the global market on the terms of the people in the communities.  Turning my attention to the different facets of the EZLN, I distinguish between what the guerrilla movement represented for civil society and the functions it had for its base.  I contend that the EZLN not only served as a campaign-engine for national and international social movements but also took on the role of the state for its supporting communities whom it provided with a base for self-controlled economic development by enlisting the support of NGOs.",301626738,,Dissertations & Theses," Barmeyer, Niels AlexanderBarmeyerAlexanderNielsBarmeyer, Niels Alexander", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760392831 , 45046841 , 101309 , U185643 , U185643", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301626738?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU185643 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Autonomy+and+development+in+zapatista+territory%3A%3A+land+management%2C+conflict+and+ngo-involvement+in+autonomous+municipalities+in+chiapas%2C+mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barmeyer%2C+Niels+Alexander&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3783,Integrated futures?: understanding relationships between smes and the internet,"This thesis examines the relationships between North-west of England small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and their adoption and implementation of the internet. It does so within the context of wider political and regulatory-driven shifts to neo-liberal economies in the west and the broader international system. In particular it addresses widespread policy proclamations calling for SMEs to 'wire up' to the internet, engage in 'innovative' activity and create new markets, products and ways of working. This has produced an emphasis on competition, flexibility, innovation, enterpreneurialism, and increasing international activity all in relation to drawing on the (facilitating) potential of the internet. This thesis critically interrogates and questions the assumptions of these policy proclamations through outlining that 'innovation' is a complex, iterative and unfolding process. Through articulating a broadly social shaping of technology perspective this thesis proposes three analytically distinct but otherwise interrelated facets of SME internet development: SME representation and the role of the owner-manager; processes of embedding the internet in the SME context and innofusion; and context(s), communication and action in addressing the communicative movement within and between the place-based SME and temporally and spatially distant customers, distributors and so on. Through using these issues fieldwork was conducted with SMEs in the North-west of England. The thesis claims that policy proclamations regarding SME internet development would benefit from an appreciation of context-sensitivity, including SME history, sector and representations, across a diverse range of SMEs. It highlights the importance of context-sensitivity in relation to attempts to embed the internet within SMEs and the types of relationships, knowledge and negotiation underpinning and informing this.

Chapter seven examines the impact that the outbreak of First World Word had on the anarchist movement, particularly in dividing it between interventionists and anti-interventionists; a split that destroyed the network of international solidarity that had been hitherto the core of the experience of political exile.  Chapter eight summarises the main arguments of the dissertation.",301642093,,Dissertations & Theses," Dipaola, P.DipaolaP.Dipaola, P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760337881 , 45030401 , 101309 , U185302 , U185302", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301642093?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," DXN079030 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Italian+anarchists+in+London+1870-1914.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dipaola%2C+P.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3786,The interplay of realism and idealism in the thought of Lionel Curtis: A critique of the conception of the ''irst debate' in international relations,"This thesis analyses the writings of Lionel Curtis (1872-1955), in particular his federation projects, from an International Relations perspective. It argues that the textbook versions of the so-called 'First Debate' between naive idealists and hard-boiled realists is inadequate for a meaningful conceptualization of Curtis's thought. Instead, a neo-Gramscian perspective is adopted here, in which the relations between state and civil society is the crucial variable distinguishing between different state/society complexes. In this interpretation, Curtis's federation plans had two aims: First, integrating the Lockean heartland against Hobbesian contenders and colonial independence movements. Second, stemming Britain's relative decline vis-à-vis the USA within the heartland. Chapter One summarizes the textbook characteristics of idealism and realism and discusses some criticisms of and alternative versions to this dichotomy. Chapter Two follows the revisionist interpretations of E.H. Carr's writings and argues that his position cannot be reduced to putting down idealism in favour of realism. Chapter Three provides an overview of Curtis's life and major activities. Chapter Four traces out textbook elements of idealism and realism within Curtis's writings and shows that he could be placed into both camps. Chapter Five introduces the neo-Gramscian framework used in the thesis, particularly the work of Kees van der Pijl. Chapter Six gives an overview of three political movements which are of relevance for understanding Curtis's thought: empire federalism, new liberalism and social imperialism. Chapter Seven shows how elements of these movements as well as of liberal internationalism and of the state monopoly tendency appear in Curtis's writings. Chapter Eight discusses what Curtis had to say about other state/society complexes of the Lockean heartland, the Hobbesian contenders and the colonial Prize area.

My thesis explores the usefulness of human rights as a tool for women's empowerment, particularly addressing how and whether universal notions of justice and rights translate into different cultural contexts.  My study focuses on violence against women, the most fundamental and universal gender-specific human rights abuse.  While violence against women curtails women's human rights, it is also increasingly conceptualised as an obstacle to development.  But if violence against women is recognised as a serious problem, why does it remain so pervasive? This question an only be answered by gaining an understanding of what violence against women is and how it is made possible.  Violence against women is a social construct;  the meaning of which varies depending on its position in time and space.  By investigating two case studies, Mexico and Pakistan, I explore how violence against women is discursively constituted in two different cultural contexts, further investigating whether local meanings are produced through, or influenced by, a human rights framework.  My case studies examine how women's rights are constituted in Mexico and Pakistan, illuminating whether local notions of women's rights are compatible with universal human rights.  This discussion further reveals how and whether local emancipatory movements incorporate or distance themselves from human rights.  The relationship between local discourses in Mexico and Pakistan and the universal human rights discourse can be understood as a reaction to the promotion of a global culture that is part of the globalisation process.  As such my thesis contributes to an ongoing debate by reflecting on tensions between multiculturalism and universal standards of justice.",301664996,,Dissertations & Theses," Dresselhaus, S.DresselhausS.Dresselhaus, S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760184901 , 45008281 , 101309 , U183189 , U183189", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301664996?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," DXN078844 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gender+and+human+rights%3A%C2%A0+a+discursive+analysis+of+violence+against+women+in+Mexico+and+Pakistan.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dresselhaus%2C+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3788,"The fruits of daring diplomacy: the making of the Moscow Treaty, 12 August 1970.","The thesis is a comprehensive analysis of the German-Soviet negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Moscow Treaty on 12 August 1970, which is based on recently released archival sources. The Moscow Treaty was the linchpin of the New Ostpolitik, which was launched by the Brandt government as a policy of reconciliation with the countries of the Eastern bloc.  It was the key to a series of treaties with the other Warsaw Pact States, Poland, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and Czechoslovakia. On the basis of these so-called 'Ostverträge' (Eastern treaties), which were ratified in 1972, Bonn was able to develop relatively stable relations with the Eastern European countries for a period of more than two decades. With a focus on the decision-making processes, within the German domestic political system as well as within the international context, the study offers a new interpretation of the shift from confrontational to détente politics. It argues that the Moscow Treaty was the product of various interrelated domestic and external factors.  The thesis shows that the change of government to a Social-Liberal coalition was the first important precondition for the new Ostpolitik to take place. It further demonstrates that the high degree of secrecy and centralisation characteristic of the policy-making of Chancellor Brandt and a few advisors, at the expense of the foreign policy bureaucracy, was another premise for the Moscow Treaty's speedy conclusion. The Chancellor's predominance in the decision-making process, however, does not mean that he alone determined the policy direction. As the analysis reveals, several actors and factors from the societal and international context limited Brandt's control over the course of New Ostpolitik. His room for manoeuvre was constrained by the coalition's narrow parliamentary majority, the opposition and the Western Allies' special rights, to mention just a few examples. Conversely, German-Soviet trade expansion, public opinion and the emerging international interest in détente in the mid-sixties constituted crucial preconditions for New Ostpolitik to succeed. In a bold gamble within this network of influences, Brandt and Bahr placed themselves at the forefront of the movement towards détente between East and West by executing their broad diplomatic design, one that was aiming at Germany's reunification as the ultimate goal.",301666353,,Dissertations & Theses," von Dannenberg, J.von DannenbergJ.von Dannenberg, J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760181641 , 45007181 , 101309 , U187679 , U187679", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301666353?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," DN082706 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+fruits+of+daring+diplomacy%3A+the+making+of+the+Moscow+Treaty%2C+12+August+1970.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=von+Dannenberg%2C+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3789,Ballast lives: an excursus on socio-political accounts of disablement in the age of globalization,"According to contemporary fashion, humankind has entered a new era marked by epochal change, be it a globalized, postmodern, post-industrialist, late modern, high modern, meta-modern, hyper-modern, super-modern, post-Fordist or post-emotional society. In contrast to such claims for epochal disjunction, this thesis identifies fundamental continuities in attitudes and policies toward disablement. Disabled Britons, since at least the 1970's, have sought to develop alternative explanations of disablement, exemplified by Mike Oliver's 'Social Model of Disability'. Despite the influence of a socio-political account amongst the activist disability movement, dominant ideology ensures that such pioneering ideas are subject to unrelenting disparagement and disinformation. Despite such ridicule, this thesis shows that claims of a coherent and liberative 'disability policy' in the UK remain grandiloquent, if not entirely inaccurate. Building on the work of Deborah Stone and Mike Oliver, in particular, I will show that, despite modest progress, British disability policy remains indelibly marked by seventeenthcentury assumptions and prejudice. This thesis contributes to the development of disability theory by providing a critical socio-economic analysis of contemporary policy and radical theorising, a task that has yet to be substantially addressed in the UK. Furthermore, by examining legal, historical, economic, political and social sources, I contend that the absence of contemporary disability policy will be shown to provide explicit benefits to the elite, to the detriment of efforts to promote and protect the emancipation of disabled Britons. The over-arching premise is that socio-political accounts of disablement continue to provide unparalleled analytical and theoretical insights into a process of disablement, not least as a particular brand of capitalism is in the ascendancy: the struggle for global hegemony aided by the advancement of a single market modelled on U.S. lines.",301688381,,Dissertations & Theses," Light, Richard JohnLightJohnRichardLight, Richard John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760216841 , 45014111 , 101309 , U176153 , U176153 , http://gala.gre.ac.uk/6227/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301688381?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," http://gala.gre.ac.uk/6227/ , DXN072370 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ballast+lives%3A+an+excursus+on+socio-political+accounts+of+disablement+in+the+age+of+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Light%2C+Richard+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3790,Cuba: De colonia a república. Política y sociedad entre 1897 y 1906,"This historical investigation of Cuba analyzes the brief yet significant years between 1897 and 1906. During that time, the largest island of the Antilles became an independent republic, going from civil war against the Spanish Crown to American military occupation and, finally, a new United States' protectorate. Cuba's pivotal evolution begins in 1897 when two majors historical events sparked the development of the Spanish-Cuban War. First, the election of the republican William McKinley as president of the United States with his new ideas on foreign affairs and, secondly, the assassination of the Spanish president Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, changing the politic strategy of his country in favour of 1895's independentist Cuban movement. The study ends in 1906 when the United States of America took control again over the Island after the liberal revolution against the Estrada's legal Cuban government. This was the final reason of the chosen title “Cuba. From Colony to Republic. Politics and Society between 1897 and 1906” . In short, Cuba between the dying Spanish empire and the rising American one. The significance of this decade is deeply embedded into the mould of the Cuban nation: from its Constitutional Law to its political parties or the Army, from the social and economical structure and the Civil Rights to the Religion and the International Affairs.

These issues include the effects of climate change on regional flooding, droughts and the impact of human activities as they relate to feedbacks on the global climate. More specifically, one needs to evaluate the potential impact of climatological variability on social, economic, and human activities. In addition, the study of their effects on agriculture, forests, local natural ecosystems and water climate-related resources, is most important. Finally, dust storms and other natural events such as droughts can have great local impacts. Approximately half of the dust in today's atmosphere may be the result of changes to the environment caused by human activities, including agriculture, overgrazing, and deforestation. Climate variability may lead to the occurrence of some severe environmental phenomena like dust storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts. Under normal conditions we can detect different dust effects associated with the movement of storms as well as different rain patterns that do not affect much of the surrounding environment either at regional or global scales. On the other hand, under abnormal climatological conditions, high anomalies of precipitation might occur due to the presence of hurricanes or other events, leading to severe flooding events. In this dissertation, we apply time series analysis techniques to remote sensing and in situ data to detect precipitation and dust storm anomalies and study their behavior on regional scales. The first application is the detection and monitoring of dust storms events over parts of the Middle East and Asia. Dust storms cause health and economic hazards. In this thesis dust storms development is examined based on using remote sensing. It utilizes a combination of optical sensing using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra, with microwave sensing using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). This approach has the potential to be superior to currently used methods by distinguishing aerosol particles from dust particles based on their grain sizes. The Middle East, particularly Egypt and the Gulf region, is selected for such application since it is located on the northern part of the desert belt, and hence is considered to be an excellent location for dust measurements. Egypt is subject to industrial pollution and therefore the complex interactions of dust with industrial aerosols can affect precipitation and Earth's radiation budget. Another location, Indo-Gangetic basin, India is also selected since it experiences heavy dust storms that originate from the Saharan desert during the pre-monsoon period. In the application over India, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) technology was used. The second application in this dissertation is the study of precipitation variability over the Mid-Atlantic region to help understanding the behavior causing anomalies like flooding and drought events. The impacts of global climate phenomena such as El Niño and La-Niña are studied emphasizing how strongly they affect or cause these events on regional scales.",305049821,,Dissertations & Theses," El-Askary, HeshamEl-AskaryHeshamEl-Askary, Hesham", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765413201 , 31638531 , 66569 , 3123080 , 3123080", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305049821?accountid=14496," 0608 Atmosphere , 0799 Remote sensing"," 0608 Atmosphere , 0799 Remote sensing"," 0608 Atmosphere , 0799 Remote sensing",," 0608 Atmosphere , 0799 Remote sensing"," Atmosphere , Remote sensing"," Applied sciences , Pure sciences , Climate , Dust storms , Environmental physics , Regional monitoring , Remote sensing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Regional+monitoring+of+environmental+physics+climate+related+anomalies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=El-Askary%2C+Hesham&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3792,The Communist Party of Canada during the Great Depression: Organizing and class consciousness,"Canada experienced its worst economic crisis during the Great Depression of the 1930s with unprecedented numbers of Canadians suffering extreme economic and social hardship. Survival and struggle to change those conditions became as much a mark of the times as the economic circumstances themselves. The Communist Party of Canada (CPC) was one organization that played a significant role in this national upsurge of struggle. The Party believed that the worsening material conditions would engender class consciousness of Canadian workers, leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system to achieve a worker-farmer socialist state. The Party was instrumental in organizing workers, farmers, the unorganized and the unemployed, however, it was not successful in raising Canadian working class consciousness to a revolutionary level. The factors that will be analyzed as being the main contributing factors to the Party's limitations are the CPC's relationship with the Comintern, repression by the Canadian state, and dominant ideology that prevailed in Canada during the Depression. From its inception in 1921 the CPC worked assiduously to meet the needs of Canadian workers in a rapidly changing economy in the 1920s and one that was also collapsing in the Depression. In many ways it recognized Canadian workers' needs in these times and was at the head of the labour movement fighting for workers' needs and defending them. However, the CPC was somewhat hamstrung by its very close relationship with the Comintern, allowing this international communist body to dictate almost every move it made whether or not it was the best for Canadian workers. State repression of the CPC and labour movement, also had a curbing effect on the advancement of the CPC in its work with Canadian workers, forcing the Party underground, decimating its leadership and intimidating Party activists, unions and workers. Finally, dominant ideology during the Depression, in spite of serious threats by alternate sets of ideas, particularly those promulgated by the CPC, largely stood its ground as defender of the present capitalist system that relied on the exploitation of Canadian workers for its survival.",305068785,,Dissertations & Theses," Burger, AnneBurgerAnneBurger, Anne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 974405261 , 19847931 , 66569 , 9780494033432 , 0494033436 , MR03343 , MR03343", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004," 9780494033432 , 0494033436", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305068785?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0626 Sociology , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0626 Sociology , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science",," 0626 Sociology , 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," Sociology , European history , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Communist+Party+of+Canada+during+the+Great+Depression%3A++Organizing+and+class+consciousness&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burger%2C+Anne&amp;isbn=9780494033432&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3793,A missiological assessment of the impact of Western mission agencies upon the development of Baptist Union churches in Russia since November of 1989,"This dissertation provides a missiological assessment concerning the impact of Western mission agencies upon the country of Russia since the change that occurred with the fall of the Berlin wall. “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work” (John 5:17). In 1989 Communism began to crumble in Eastern Europe and the USSR. By 1991 its demise was complete. In the fall of Communism the action of God became visible in the history of the last century. While a variety of political and economic theories have been offered to explain the fall of Communism, the real reason was spiritual: Communism failed primarily because it fundamentally misunderstood human nature in that it failed to recognize that humanity is created in the image of God. Christian churches entered a time of unlimited freedom for religious action. The churches, especially the Protestants, understood the crucial importance of that historic moment. Western mission organizations were no exception. During the past fourteen years, a significant number of western agencies have traveled to the former Soviet Union to do missions work. These groups engaged in every aspect of missions from public evangelism crusades to humanitarian social projects for needy people. In order to assess the impact of the mission organizations in the twentieth century in any given country, it is imperative for one to know the historical facts of that country. This is important to know what has shaped the worldview of the people and how it affected their way of thinking. Because of the abundance of historical data on Christianity in Russia, this writer has provided the reader with enough information in two chapters to enable one to picture not only how Christianity came to Russia in the tenth century, but also how one section of the Evangelical movement evolved into what it is today—Russian Baptist churches. Chapter four is dedicated to making an actual assessment of the facts with special attention being given to evangelism, church planting, and the education efforts of Western missionaries and the organizations they represent. Chapter five examines two case studies of the direct impact of the western agencies on the theological concept of eternal security and the development of Sunday school ministry among Baptist churches in Russia. Chapter six provides observations and recommendations concerning the involvement of Western agencies in Russia. Since this writer has been working in the International Department of the Baptist Union of Russia since 1989 (which was responsible for helping Westerners to set up their ministries), his personal observations provide valid and valuable analysis for accessing recommendations for the future ministry of Western mission agencies as well as for Russian Baptists. Special attention is given to the efforts of cooperation between mission agencies serving in Russia and Russian Baptist leaders and their churches. The author concludes that the sincere desire of the western agencies is to aid in the development of Christian mission work in Russia as a matter close to their hearts. At the same time, churches in the West are providing financial and human help which cannot avoid the propensity of creating among the Russians a sense of dependency, paternalism, and materialism. This dissertation helps the West to learn much from the Russian situation as they try to focus their work more in the areas of spiritual realities, indigeneity, and partnership.",305079214,,Dissertations & Theses," Baraniuk, Fiodor V.BaraniukV.FiodorBaraniuk, Fiodor V.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 775156181 , 32107631 , 66569 , 3138626 , 3138626", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305079214?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations"," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations",," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations"," Religion , Religious history , Religious congregations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Baptist Union , Evangelicals , Mission agencies , Russia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+missiological+assessment+of+the+impact+of+Western+mission+agencies+upon+the+development+of+Baptist+Union+churches+in+Russia+since+November+of+1989&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baraniuk%2C+Fiodor+V.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3794,The secret education of a wise sovereign: Toward Kant's idea of perpetual peace,"Toward Perpetual Peace is Immanuel Kant's treatise on international peace. The argumentative strategy of the text is aimed at increasing the likelihood of peace by reducing the risk sovereign nations face when attempting to trust one another. As part of the risk reduction strategy Kant prohibits nations from keeping secrets. Secrets erode trust and thus jeopardize the movement toward perpetual peace. Having established this, Kant issues the Secret Article for Perpetual Peace which allows the sovereign to benefit from the counsel of an educated citizenry without acknowledging their influence and, in effect, he receives counsel in secret. Kant acknowledges the contradiction yet defends it, claiming that public consultation is damaging to the sovereign's dignity and thus must be conducted in secret. Although the dignity defense is ultimately a self-refuting and, therefore, inadequate grounds for the secret article, this thesis argues that the article can be understood as being commensurate with Kant's project of enlightenment. I resolve the contradiction by reading the article in the context of What is Enlightenment? Not only is the article coherent in this context, it necessarily creates a range of action beyond the contractual limitations dictated by the private obligations of the social contract to empower the sovereign to take possession of his reason and become an enlightened public thinker.

The methodology used for the thesis is Organic Inquiry and the subjects, or “co-researchers” as they are called in Organic Inquiry, are young women and men who have stepped forward to create six local learning leadership centres in Zimbabwe, Senegal, Croatia, India, Holland and the United Kingdom. Data were collected through a series of meetings in which stories were gathered from the seven founders of these six learning centres. Stories from six were collected in person, and from one by telephone. The researcher and co-researchers have been in relationship with each other for more than two years. After transcribing the stories, the researcher engaged in numerous other conversations and e-mail exchanges with the co-researchers in order to discern patterns and themes. The literature review was used to further illuminate the patterns and themes. These leaders live and work from a sense of calling, and do so in the company of others. While they work separately, they do not work alone. They have had multi-cultural and other personal experiences which appear to have helped them develop an expanded consciousness. They work from a spiritual center and have learned to embrace uncertainty and ambiguity. They are conscious of core assumptions which are embedded in their work and continually uncover and reflect on those assumptions. These leaders may be part of an as yet un-named global social movement, locally rooted, which is enspirited —coming from a deep sense of being called, appreciative —looking for opportunities and assets to build from, and emergent —with outcomes that grow naturally from the work rather than being established in advance. While their work is local and they believe that local work, networked globally, creates the possibility for transformation. This thesis is itself a story of possibility and a story of faith.",305098577,,Dissertations & Theses," Stilger, Robert L.StilgerL.RobertStilger, Robert L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765836481 , 19267431 , 66569 , 3126432 , 3126432", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305098577?accountid=14496," 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science"," 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science"," 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science",," 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0615 Political science"," Social psychology , Sociology , Political science"," Social sciences , Psychology , Activism , Leadership , Social movements , Spiritual",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Discovering+new+stories%3A++An+organic+inquiry+into+enspirited+leadership&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stilger%2C+Robert+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3796,A model for humane ministry with migrant workers in Korea,"Globalization in the past few decades has integrated the world economy into a complex whole, and today the international movements of production, capital, information, technology, trade and labor across the national borders are creating one giant global economy. Globalization is based on capitalism, so the few wealthy countries with huge capital and high technology control the economy and the welfare of the numerous destitute countries. Unfortunately, economic globalization has polarized the world into the wealthy and the poor. As a result, the poor countries are situated to continually witness the increase in poverty, the depression of economic growth, and the structural unemployment while the wealthy countries continue to be prosperous. In Asia, this global economic system raised the newly industrial countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Since 1960, these countries have accepted economic development policy with economic technology and capitals from the West earlier than other Asia's countries. These newly industrial countries have rapidly achieved a big success of economic development which is called ‘Asian miracle.’ On the contrary, economic growth of these countries not only has created serious production and price competition with other competitor countries but also has brought a decrease in population caused by the trend of birth control. These phenomena caused a lack of workers for ""3-D type industry."" 1 Most employers running ""3-D type industry"" in these countries have been in need of hiring cheap workers in order to survive their businesses. This situation has brought in a huge mobility of cheap laborers from poor countries to seek work in the newly industrial countries. Since 1988, migrant workers from poor countries have increasingly entered Korea as the country started importing laborers. The increase of migrant workers in Korea results from both industrial owners' demand to carry out their businesses with a lower cost, and migrant workers' desire to look for jobs out of their homeland. Most of migrant workers in Korea work under unfair and inhumane treatments: frequently delayed salaries, enforced overtime work, unreasonably low wages, malignant violence, and abusive language at work place, etc. In addition, the workers suffer from unfavorable migrant policies, industrial disasters, or medical problems. They also live in cultural indifference and ethnic prejudice from Korean society. Now, the number of international migrant workers in Korea is about 400,000, and the Korean churches face a serious challenge to take care of migrant workers. This project focuses on advocating for the human rights of migrant workers in Korea to bring about social justice in Korean society for migrant workers as well as helping the church to do humane ministry working in cooperation with migrant workers. First, this study reviews the history of migrant workers in Korea and the Korean churches' ministry for and with migrant workers. Then, this study analyzes results found through historical research and the recent situation on issues of the church's ministry with migrant workers. Finally, this study seeks to explore biblical and theological foundations for an appropriated strategy for humane ministry with migrant workers. A claim is made here that the God of righteousness in the Old Testament that liberated the Israelites is the same God who will liberate migrant workers in today's Korean society. Such a theology of righteous God is complemented by the New Testament's God of love in Jesus Christ who is in favor of the oppressed people everywhere. Lastly, this project is to develop some programs that are designed as an educational and practical tool for church's ministry working with supporting agencies (individuals, public institutions, associations and private sectors) and migrant workers in Korea. This model for humane ministry builds up a new vision for the Korean churches in the twenty first century to carry out potential missionary work, and hopefully this model will help vitalize the Christian sense of call to do God's ministry for and with migrant workers.

Specifically, I focused on the information contained in the ideology, knowledge, values, and goals as defined or produced by a group of Maya professionals who attended an experimental program, Program for Integral Development of the Mayan Population (PRODIPMA), developed and administered by Rafael Landívar University and sponsored by USAID from 1986 to 1993, in Guatemala. This ethnographic account has charted the movements by which our focal group entered the community with a strong consciousness of their cultural identity. Members of this group are currently pursuing the creation of critical pro-Mayan and intercultural discourses. They are steering the direction of institutional activism towards “modernization” according to national and global definitions. I conducted my research using both archival and fieldwork techniques. Interviewing protocols were designed and applied to university authorities, faculty, tutors, and a representative number of indigenous alumni. The study included a conscious in-depth analysis of both the institutional context and the curricular contents to which all the indigenous students were exposed to. All curricular contents were defined to reach Landívar University's academic standards and social goals. Landívar inheritated a Western tradition consisting of European philosophy, science, and methodologies. As a consequence, URL based the academic program on European and American authors, scientists, and philosophers, converting the PRODIPMA program, epistemologically, into a post-colonizing program for indigenous students. However, Landívar University's commitment toward the emergence of an educated and developed multicultural society is based upon its Jesuit-Catholic ideology which, according to their principles, contributes to Guatemala's development through the empowerment of Mayan communities by means of making available their access to “pertinent” education (linguistic and culturally). Mayan modernity consists of openly gaining entry into universities and important job positions while they take advantage of technology and communications to enhance their values, identity, and languages of their culture. Conversely, the official policies of Guatemala continue to retain the privileged status of the Ladinos. The hegemonic Ladino (Spanish) paradigm is upheld socially, politically, and culturally.",305152440,,Dissertations & Theses," Lima Soto, Ricardo E.Lima SotoE.RicardoLima Soto, Ricardo E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765351911 , 31644241 , 66569 , 3122504 , 3122504", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305152440?accountid=14496, 0324 Archaeology, 0324 Archaeology, 0324 Archaeology,, 0324 Archaeology, Archaeology," Social sciences , Education , Globalization , Guatemalan-Maya , Maya , Modernization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emergent+Guatemalan-Maya+discourses+and+institutions+of+%E2%80%9Cmoderinzation%E2%80%9D%3A%0AThe+impact+of++*education+upon+the+representation+of+the+Maya+in+a+globalized+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lima+Soto%2C+Ricardo+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3798,"Weeds in Linnaeus's garden: Science and segregation, eugenics, and the rhetoric of racism at the University of Minnesota and the Big Ten, 1900–1945","In 1931, Lotus Delta Coffman, President of the University of Minnesota and noted Progressive educational reformer, refused to admit a black student to residence in the newly constructed Pioneer Hall.

I analyze a rich trove of archived material revealing sedimented layers of institutional racism, much of it motivated by changing patterns of urban migration, immigration, and gender expectations. With astonishing candor, administrators from universities across the country shared strategies for justifying and enforcing segregated facilities, thereby muddying usual conceptions of the American Progressive movement and throwing into confusion traditional binaries of left and right.

Abrams, 1994). Focusing on key art movements and artists' groups which defined postwar discourses on radical critique, this history charts the intellectual, aesthetic, and stylistic developments of avant-garde art in Japan from circa 1951 to 1970, a period defined by the leftist struggle against the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, known as Anpo. Both American and Japanese historians have studied the sociopolitical debates that mark the postwar period. What is less well-known is the history of new artistic forms and practices that emerged from this era of unprecedented upheaval, and how radical artists' strategies underscored and reworked the leftist discourses on democratic revolution, political subjectivity, and cultural anarchism. This study examines the avant-garde within the broader context of postwar Japanese social, political, and cultural history, focusing on its vigorous critique of the ruling ideologies of modernization and its opposition to institutionalized culture and politics. This dissertation originated as an art historical research topic and certain formalist modes of stylistic analysis and aesthetic interpretation prevail. Among the questions explored here are: How can national characteristics of modern art be defined within a global discourse of modernity and modernism? If originality is the crux of the modernist adventure, how do we interpret this work within the framework of the modernist discourse? Drawing on extensive primary sources and interviews, this dissertation aims to construct the first history in English of the following art movements: Gutai Art Association, Bokujin-kai and Sodeisha, the Yomiuri Indépendant's Anti-Art groups, Obsessional Art and Ankoku Butoh dance, VIVO and the Postwar School of Photography, Tokyo Fluxus and Conceptual Art, and the Mono-ha movement. The Introduction describes the Anpo movement, whose periodization defines this study; reviews the Taisho and Showa prehistory of the Japanese avant-garde; explores the discourse on cultural autonomy in modern Japanese intellectual debates; and offers a theoretical framework for defining the terminology of “radical critique.” The Conclusion reviews the contradictions inherent in the Japanese avant-garde's embrace of leftist cultural critiques, and identifies problematic issues of historicizing zen'ei (avant-garde) and gendai (contemporary) art.",305166021,,Dissertations & Theses," Munroe, AlexandraMunroeAlexandraMunroe, Alexandra", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 795931721 , 31634811 , 66569 , 0496052373 , 9780496052370 , 3146689 , 3146689", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004," 0496052373 , 9780496052370", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305166021?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," History , Art history , Cultural anthropology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Art , Avant-garde , Culture , Japan , Politics , Postwar , Radical critique",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Avant+-garde+art+in+postwar+Japan%3A++The+culture+and+politics%0Aof+radical+critique%2C+1951%E2%80%931970&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Munroe%2C+Alexandra&amp;isbn=0496052373&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3800,Writing a third language: A genealogy of feminist jazz poetics,"This project focuses on the connections between formal innovation and feminist statement forged in the work of African-American women jazz poets through invocations of music. I argue that this work is written in a “third language” spurred by the exclusion of black women from white feminist practices and the predominately male culture of jazz performance. Each writer's work engages in dialogue with contemporary jazz and feminist movements in order to claim an alternate space for the creative acts of black women. My analysis is grounded in the premise that jazz poetry, a category of formally innovative and politically motivated work that features references to blues and jazz music, can be productively interpreted using a genealogical approach. I argue in my first chapter that Sherley Anne Williams uses regionalist themes and blues references to highlight the restrictions historically placed upon black female bodies. Bessie Smith's appearance as a representative blueswoman in many of Williams's jazz poems suggests that Smith's public attitudes symbolized agency for black women. In my second chapter, I read Sonia Sanchez's jazz poems in the context of her affiliations with Black Arts and the Black Power movement. Sanchez explored bebop's performance techniques and social connotations in her jazz elegies; her later interest in blues' potential for feminist expression resulted in her creation of a blues haiku. I examine the formal and thematic roots of Jayne Cortez's jazz poetry in my third chapter, linking her compositional approach to the performance traditions of blues and jazz. Her scatological imagery also positions her work in the context of surrealist theory and ecofeminist criticism. My final chapter looks at Harryette Mullen's use of both the formal techniques of the Language group and African-American vernacular traditions. These elements enable her to define innovative language as a tool for feminist statement. The dissertation concludes with my assessment of the connections between these poets' political statements about society, environment, body, and language. I consider the work of East Los Angeles poet Wanda Coleman as evidence that future feminist jazz poetics contributes to global theory through references to geographies outside the American mainstream.",305168185,,Dissertations & Theses," Ryan, Jennifer DeniseRyanDeniseJenniferRyan, Jennifer Denise", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765922791 , 19275361 , 66569 , 3129337 , 3129337", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305168185?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0325 African Americans"," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0325 African Americans"," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0325 African Americans",," 0591 American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0325 African Americans"," American literature , Womens studies , African Americans"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African-American , Feminist , Jazz , Poetics , Third language , Writing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Writing+a+third+language%3A++A+genealogy+of+feminist+jazz+poetics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ryan%2C+Jennifer+Denise&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3801,The novels of Álvaro Pombo: Registers of the sociopolitical history of contemporary Spain,"In 1977, two years after the death of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, poet and novelist Álvaro Pombo returned to his native Spain from an 11-year exile in England. Finding himself excluded from his country's literary mainstream, Pombo struggled to find both an audience and a publisher for his poems, short stories, and novels. Through the years, as his production increased and he received more and more recognition for his efforts, his position on the literary margins began to shift. In 2004, after winning numerous awards and publishing 11 novels, two books of poetry, a collection of articles, and two collections of short stories, he became the newest member of Spain's Real Academia Española . Nearly 30 years after his homecoming, Álvaro Pombo has finally arrived, with his academy membership signaling his successful repositioning from the margins to the center of Spanish literary circles. Pombo, however, was not the only Spaniard to experience exile during the Franco regime, nor was he the only citizen to experience marginalization from centers of power. Many of Spain's citizens experienced similar exclusions during the years of the dictatorship, the transition, and the new democracy. A study of Pombo's novels reveals that his characters often represent many such excluded individuals attempting to alter their marginalized status in Spanish society. Moreover, his novels serve as registers of the political and social changes occurring at the national level during the country's movement from economic and political isolation during the Franco regime toward full and democratic participation in the global economy of the 21 st century. In my analysis of four of his novels, El parecido (1979), El héroe de las mansardas de Mansard (1983), Los delitos insignificantes (1986), and Telepena de Celia Cecilia Villalobo (1995), I explore how the power negotiations of Pombo's marginalized characters illuminate similar manipulations at the social and political level. Although nearly 20 years separate the publication of the four novels, there are connecting threads among the works. Through the telling of each story, Álvaro Pombo lends insight into Spain's historical development by imbedding its sociopolitical history within the pages of his novel.",305171636,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohn, Mary ChristineMohnChristineMaryMohn, Mary Christine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 885614951 , 19586741 , 66569 , 9780542000737 , 0542000733 , 3164777 , 3164777", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004," 9780542000737 , 0542000733", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305171636?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature"," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature"," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature",," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature"," Literature , Romance literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Novels , Pombo, Alvaro , Sociopolitical history , Spain",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+novels+of+%C3%81lvaro+Pombo%3A++Registers+of+the+sociopolitical+history+of+contemporary+Spain&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohn%2C+Mary+Christine&amp;isbn=9780542000737&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3802,"Eileen Egan: Portrait of the life, lifestance, and pedagogy of a Catholic prophet of peace","Eileen Egan was one of the leading Catholic peace activists of the 20 th century. She was the first layperson to work with Catholic Relief Services, founded Pax Christi USA, brought Mother Teresa's work to the attention of the world community, and was a companion to Dorothy Day and thirty-year associate editor of the Catholic Worker . Founding organizations for justice and peace, highlighting the violence inherent in the plight of the refugee, advocating for reform as journalist and author, pointing to the fresh exemplars of the character of Christ in the witness of Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day, calling forth an integrative understanding of Catholic social teachings—these are the legacies of Eileen Egan's lifelong commitment to international service and peacemaking. This work—humanistic, theological, and historical—is a biographic and critical study inscribing Egan's life. It is an integration of life and lifestance, making more explicit her contributions to the Catholic peace movement and her implicit theology and pedagogy of peacemaking. After first exploring Egan's key biographic markers, the study then positions Egan as a theologian using three classic sources of theological reflection (experience, Scripture, and Tradition). Using the narrative of her life and her over fifty years of writing and speaking on issues of peace and justice, it culls out eight themes of a systematic theology of peacemaking that undergird and emerge from her work. The study also explores Egan's legacy as a religious educator using the metaphors “prophet,” “advocate,” and “exemplar,” bringing her pedagogy and distinctive contribution to a reframing of a Catholic ethos of peace into conversation with educators and religious educators. The study argues that her critical questioning of the traditions, assumptions, and premises of Catholic teaching on war and peace is a sign of the emancipatory, transformative learning that is at the heart of what it means to engage in religious education. The study concludes with an analysis of Egan's theology and pedagogy of peacemaking, identifying areas where they are either incomplete or have presaged contemporary movements in reflecting on and educating about peace and war. It also examines links between peace and women's issues and explores the leadership style modeled by Egan that finds resonance in the management sciences.",305185001,,Dissertations & Theses," Baratte, Linda L.BaratteL.LindaBaratte, Linda L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 766277081 , 31887051 , 66569 , 3137772 , 3137772", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305185001?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0469 Theology , 0330 Religious congregations , 0304 Biographies"," 0520 Education history , 0469 Theology , 0330 Religious congregations , 0304 Biographies"," 0520 Education history , 0469 Theology , 0330 Religious congregations , 0304 Biographies",," 0520 Education history , 0469 Theology , 0330 Religious congregations , 0304 Biographies"," Education history , Theology , Religious congregations , Biographies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Education , Language, literature and linguistics , Catholic , Egan, Eileen , Peace activism , Pedagogy , Prophet of peace",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Eileen+Egan%3A++Portrait+of+the+life%2C+lifestance%2C+and+pedagogy+of+a+Catholic+prophet+of+peace&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baratte%2C+Linda+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3803,Framing the world: Elite ideologies in United States media discourse of the War on Terrorism campaign,"This dissertation analyzes how United States elites ideologically framed events of September 11, 2001 (9–11) and the implementation of the first year of the ‘War on Terrorism’ (WOT). In seeking to understand how the strategic use of frames by different categories of U.S. elites (e.g., government officials, corporate officials, etc.) effectively limited or expanded options for state action in response to the attacks of 9–11, this dissertation utilizes and builds on the framing perspective of the social movements' literature. This study considers how elite opinion shapers mobilize collective action frames for elite ends, which draw upon a collective identity and shared racialized, gendered and classed ideologies of ‘America’, its enemies, and its role in the world. Qualitative Content Analysis and Critical Framing Analysis were employed upon a theoretically purposive sample of major speeches of George W. Bush (GWB) and New York Times (NYT) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorials, staff commentaries and guest op-eds. Differences and similarities in diagnostic, prognostic and motivational framing between sources and categories of elites were identified and sociologically explained. This analysis included measuring the amount of support each media document gave for the ideological assumptions of the WOT as represented in speeches of GWB. Although the WSJ was more supportive of the WOT than the NYT, the NYT editorial board was farther ahead of its readership in support of the WOT. And media elites from both newspapers were more supportive of the WOT than government officials. Near consensus for all groups of elites was found for the policy of preemptive strikes and specifically regime change in Iraq. The media were found to not only translate and circulate elite ideologies of the WOT but to help amplify the framing of them as well. What emerged from the data while employing Critical Framing Analysis to examine constructions of race; class and economics; and gender in elite discourse, was an ideology that can best be described as an imperialist ideology. It is argued that elites and media elites in particular, delegitimated not only ‘terrorists’ but those who criticized the ‘inevitability’ of the Americanization of global economy and culture.",305204724,,Dissertations & Theses," Klocke, Brian VirgilKlockeVirgilBrianKlocke, Brian Virgil", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 828402671 , 19298711 , 66569 , 9780496123612 , 0496123610 , 3151935 , 3151935", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004," 9780496123612 , 0496123610", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305204724?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Social structure , Political science , Mass media , International law , International relations"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Discourse , Elite ideologies , Framing , Media , Terrorism , War on terrorism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framing+the+world%3A+Elite+ideologies+in+United+States+media+discourse+of+the+War+on+Terrorism+campaign&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klocke%2C+Brian+Virgil&amp;isbn=9780496123612&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3804,The privatization of standardization: Enclosure of knowledge and *policy in the age of digital information,"This is a study of the standardization process and establishment of technical standards that define virtually every artifact of the modern world. In the information and communication technology field, such standards specify everything from the prongs on plugs to software protocols that make the Internet work. Historically, standards have been set largely by volunteers in committees operating within a range of environments, institutional rules and social practice, but they generally have espoused traditional principles of accessibility, democratic deliberation, public accountability and balanced stakeholder representation. A recent trend that has prompted much discussion is the increasing privatization of standardization activities under various corporations, trade associations, and consortia. This trend is far removed from the traditional, and, as claimed, more “open” and “democratic”, practices of voluntary consensus committees. Because standards play a powerful role in shaping technologies and their diffusion into society, the trend raises significant public policy issues about how the public interest may be represented and served in today's digital information age that is increasingly dependent on technical standards. Within fields of law and public policy, an oppositional discourse has emerged concerning the privatization or “enclosure” of ideas—analogous to the land enclosure movement in 16 th century England—and on the expansion of intellectual property rights, resulting in the “fencing off” of the intellectual commons. Since standardization practice can be viewed as a collaborative effort in idea formation—an intellectual commons—this study uses the enclosure discourse as a framework for examining the debate over the privatization of standards. This study, which draws upon a theoretical perspective of political economy and theories of the public sphere, applies methods of discourse analysis and historiography in examining the quest for legitimization by consortia and arguments for their inclusion in the international standards system. Furthermore, the study seeks to clarify the discourse on standards and standardization by showing how the ideas and arguments that form, apply, and justify policy decisions rely on symbols, beliefs, and ideologies that are rhetorically constituted. It is further argued that key terms used in the discourse, i.e. , open, public, and private, are often ill defined and conflicting.",305205330,,Dissertations & Theses," Schoechle, Timothy DuncanSchoechleDuncanTimothySchoechle, Timothy Duncan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765353151 , 31645021 , 66569 , 3123287 , 3123287", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305205330?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0459 Communication , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0708 Mass media , 0459 Communication , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0708 Mass media , 0459 Communication , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0708 Mass media , 0459 Communication , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Mass media , Communication , International law , International relations"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Digital information , Enclosure of knowledge , Policy , Privatization , Standardization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+privatization+of+standardization%3A+Enclosure+of+knowledge+and++*policy+in+the+age+of+digital+information&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schoechle%2C+Timothy+Duncan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3805,"Gender, Maya identity, and the multi -level politics of forming community health promoters in highland Guatemala","This dissertation examines the process and politics of training community health promoters in three non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the Kaqchikel Maya-speaking region of Guatemala's central highlands in the mid-1990s. Although prior research on community health worker (CHW) programs has tended to focus on the role of either local-level culture or macro-level political economy in affecting CHW participation, this comparative NGO analysis highlights the critical role of local organizations in linking macro and micro-level influences and in shaping the patterns and meaning of CHW participation. In particular, I found that different training approaches had a significant impact on the characteristics of trainees, including their gender and life cycle stage. I argue that from their founding, Guatemalan health promoter programs have helped determine who took on this new health role. I examine three major debates within these programs regarding health promotion, traditional Maya medicine, and women's involvement to elucidate how these NGOs helped form distinct images of health, gender, and ethnic identity through their training philosophies and procedures, thereby contributing to changes in individual promoter lives and to broader social identity movements. I suggest that conflicts over the debate issues arose from shifting and often contradictory ideas and material conditions at different levels regarding health work, Maya identity, and gender, which often left NGO trainers and promoters caught in the middle. In addition to revealing inconsistencies in macro-level policies, this study demonstrates variability in views and practices at the local community level, belying any simple conclusions about the impact of “local culture.” Furthermore, the NGO comparison highlights how organization traits including the health promotion philosophy, training scale, and staff composition influenced the ways organizations approached health, gender, and Maya identity. By showing the multi-level dynamics involved, this research calls into question common assumptions about the ability of local NGOs and CHWs to connect easily with local communities and represent community interests. I argue that the complex, multi-level politics of CHW participation has implications for theory, ethics, and practice in the fields of anthropology and international health.",305209161,,Dissertations & Theses," Zavatone-Veth, Heidi MariaZavatone-VethMariaHeidiZavatone-Veth, Heidi Maria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 766263021 , 19277011 , 66569 , 3138413 , 3138413", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305209161?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health"," Cultural anthropology , Public health , Studies , Guatemala"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Community health , Gender , Guatemala , Identity , Maya , Nongovernmental organizations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gender%2C+Maya+identity%2C+and+the+multi+-level+politics+of+forming+community+health+promoters+in+highland+Guatemala&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zavatone-Veth%2C+Heidi+Maria&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3806,Facts and artifacts: Otto Neurath and the social science of socialization,"This dissertation traces the career of Otto Neurath (1882–1945), a Viennese intellectual who played a central role in establishing two key movements in European philosophy, the Vienna Circle and the United of Science movement, both of which rejected metaphysics and embraced empirical science. Neurath himself abhorred speculative thinking in all its cultural and social guises and spent his life trying to put his philosophy into practice. Although he is typically regarded as a philosopher of knowledge and innovator in graphic design, he pursued a range of careers that gave expression to his theoretical concerns. Between 1917 and 1940, he helped organize countless museums and exhibitions in over a dozen countries, and between 1921 and 1925 he was a leading housing officer in socialist Vienna. He brought to bear on these appointments his Austro-Marxian brand of empiricism, which was heavily utilitarian and anti-Idealist in outlook. As a housing director, Neurath had nothing but disdain for priceless artifacts and rare artistic collections. He thought that they absorbed the subject's attention without stimulating his or her intellect; they fetishized the “spectacle value” of objects at the expense of being socially informative. As a housing advocate and city planner, meanwhile, Neurath was an ardent critic of picturesque and Baroque planning schemes and a foe of both laissez-faire urbanism and anti-city utopianism. He believed that overly concentrated urban development bred disease and inequality, while its inverse harmed worker productivity. Most of all, he detested Beaux-Arts and Sittesque urban planning on account of the priority they gave to aesthetics, beauty, and “good taste.” Neurath's approach to solving urban and museological issues, I argue, consisted in organizing his thoughts around facts rather than artifacts. Facts, he contended, are interconnected—they're governed by rules rather than exceptions. Artifacts, on the other hand, project the illusion of autonomy; like the “curiosity cabinets” of the 17 th century, they are defined by their relative uniqueness or singularity. They pique the imagination, he contended, but they also breed irrationalism—an escape into disorder. For Neurath, extinguishing this “auratic” urge was central to the project of installing a truly rational culture. In the area of museum administration, I explore in my thesis how Neurath pioneered the use of mechanically reproducible media—photographs, lantern slides, graphic diagrams, and the like. Most famously, he invented a language of pictoral communication known as the International System of Typographic Picture Education (“Isotype”), whose hieroglyphic signs are all but ubiquitous in today's airports, restrooms, and city streets. In the realm of city planning, Neurath was one of the earliest advocates of standardized mass housing. He developed innovative schemes for rationalizing the production of agrarian settlements and organizing and educating building cooperatives.

The Macuxi are a Carib-speaking group who inhabit the savannahs and forested mountains near the border of Brazil and Guyana. My research examines the way in which the Brazilian Macuxi were able to reclaim their Indian identity and regain control over their territory using the very activity-cattle ranching-that colonized their territory. The Macuxi have also become important players in national indigenous politics and have important relationships with international organizations. The Macuxi, who used to be referred to as caboclos —a term that means both mestiço , or “mixed,” and “civilized”—became Indians again in the process of becoming increasingly globalized. My argument is that the recreation of their group identity is not an opportunistic maneuver but instead is a phenomenon that must be understood within the process of reorganization of Macuxi society in face of severe economic and political exploitation. This dissertation constitutes a regional analysis that focuses on the current forms of organization of Macuxi society within the conjuncture of Amazonian political and economic structures. It is based on twenty months of fieldwork among the Macuxi, conducted primarily in the villages of Maturuca and Willimon. Both communities are located in the mountains, which is a region distinct in several important ways from other Macuxi regions. My research approach is rooted in a methodology based on an enduring, reflexive and dialogical relationship between researcher and subjects.

Power and complicity have acquired more sophistication and have become more resistant to representation, resistance and critique. Ironically, the achievements of feminist, postcolonial, civil rights and queer activism and scholarship have permeated contemporary Chinese communities to such an extent, that the rhetoric of radicalism is now largely available to all kinds of appropriations. Traditional forms of social resistance and radical criticism are not only challenged by new alternatives, but are also skillfully appropriated by conservative constituencies as well as state and capitalist rhetoric. The ethics of radicalism begs rethinking. Radicalism has become a symptomatic burning itch of the body politic: both as a persistent and exploitable wound, and a battling desire to heal. Thus, this dissertation is premised on a hermeneutics of suspicion: how can we tell whether radicalism is radical anymore? The introduction layout the methodologies: the typological analysis of the colonialism-nationalism-sexism nexus of issues in relation to radicalism through a politicized and geo-historically contextualized use of Lacanian psychoanalysis informed by poststructuralist, feminist and postcolonial scholarship. Chapter one studies the relation of fetishism to nationalism, and the relation of radicalism to gender and ethic masochism and masquerade to show how nationalism as a discourse of resistance and radicalism was problematic since its inception. Through the transnational Protect Diaoyutai movements, chapter two shows how nationalism as a perverse symbolic order and cultural imaginary has become the obstacle to radicalism in contemporary Chinese communities. Chapter three shows how postcolonial and transgender identity politics do not automatically guarantee radicalism. Chapter four continues to expose some forms of postcolonial identity politics as gendered colonial melancholia and hysteria rather than radicalism. Chapter five analyzes how sexism and racism could compromise the radicalism of tongzhi/queer politics due to the imposition of a kind of cultural nationalist and anti-colonial appropriation of the local tongzhi discourse.",305217158,,Dissertations & Theses," Szeto, Mirana MaySzetoMayMiranaSzeto, Mirana May", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 828418281 , 19295151 , 66569 , 9780496158003 , 0496158007 , 3155038 , 3155038", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004," 9780496158003 , 0496158007", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305217158?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Comparative literature , Asian literature , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Chinese , Hong Kong , Postcolonialism , Radicalism , Societies , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+radical+itch%3A++Rethinking+radicalism+in+contemporary+Chinese+societies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Szeto%2C+Mirana+May&amp;isbn=9780496158003&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3809,Cosmopolitan Confucianism: China's road to modern science,"This dissertation shows the centrality of scientific issues in the history of late imperial China. It engages issues of comparative history, trans-cultural contacts and exchange, and mobility of knowledge. I focus on three major regions in China (the court in the north China plain, lower Yangzi delta, and Canton in the south) between 1680 and 1820, and investigate a specific intellectual and cultural fusion of science and classicism as part of the elite mentality that had taken form by the end of eighteenth-century in China. The value-creating elites in eighteenth-century China relentlessly reconstructed and reinvented the physical cosmos, and sought political and social legitimacy seeking sanction for their scientific views in the Classics. I call this process the emergence of cosmopolitan Confucianism, a movement that can be further decomposed into two intertwined subprocesses. The first part is the state-driven enterprise to appropriate Jesuit cosmography, trigonometry, algebra, and global geography; the second part is the gentry-led resistance leading subsequently to the reconstruction of this body of foreign knowledge into domesticable form and content. The Qing state monopolized the formative phase of cosmopolitan Confucianism by appropriating Jesuit science into the state apparatus. The gentry-merchant alliance in the lower Yangzi basin initiated the second phase of cosmopolitan Confucianism by promoting a specific vision of classical interpretation. The development of cosmopolitan Confucianism culminated around 1820 and then declined, on the eve of the second wave of the protestant import of industrial science into China.",305218668,,Dissertations & Theses," Hu, MinghuiHuMinghuiHu, Minghui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 885614501 , 19586171 , 66569 , 9780496995332 , 0496995332 , 3164409 , 3164409", Dissertation/Thesis, 2004," 9780496995332 , 0496995332", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305218668?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0585 Science history"," 0332 History , 0585 Science history"," 0332 History , 0585 Science history",," 0332 History , 0585 Science history"," History , Science history"," Social sciences , China , Confucianism , Cosmopolitanism , Jesuits , Science",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cosmopolitan+Confucianism%3A+China%27s+road+to+modern+science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hu%2C+Minghui&amp;isbn=9780496995332&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3810,An exploration of the links between male identity and the development of the field of menâ��s community education in Ireland,"The 1990s witnessed a new social phenomenon in Irish society â�� the emergence of menâ��s groups in local communities, some of which receive funding within the community education sector.Â  Across three research sites, two menâ��s groups and one practitionersâ�� network, this qualitative study explores emergent models of practice as well as understandings of masculinity and gender relations at play in these sites.Â  This study is therefore located at the interface of two nascent fields of inquiry in Irish research: the question of male identity and the role of menâ��s groups in combating male isolation, social exclusion and educational disadvantage.

For this reason, few researchers have paid due attention to the generation of modern literary current in China as they have neglected the fact that Chinese literary enlightenment has rather great influence and restraint in the modern literary current. In fact, if people acknowledge that the cultural nature of the Chinese enlightenment has been evolved from the study of Confucian classics to that of literature, the influence of thought of the Chinese literary enlightenment has triggered the emergence of modern literary current, which has facilitated the arising of modern literary movement. At the same time, it must be recognized that the demand of ideology reconstruction for the Chinese literary enlightenment has restricted the full arising of the literary movement with the medium of the modern literary current. This is why the arising of modern Chinese literary movement requires the theory precedes literary creation, but unavoidably causes the biased result of the literary movement. The present study of the literary enlightenment and the modern literary current has two characteristics: one is the study of literary enlightenment and currents by dividing the modern era into two periods; the other is the study of them by separating the traditional influence of native culture from the modern influence of foreign culture. The first characteristic has initiated the second characteristic, and the second characteristic has strengthened the first characteristic. Thus it results in a quite influential study paradigm which focuses on one period with traditional influence or that with modern influence. However, in terms of the research tendency, there are also two major characteristics: the first characteristic is the research for the mentioned in the long period of time in history, the second is the synthetic research for modern transformation above mentioned. The first characteristic has facilitated the second characteristic, and the second characteristic has promoted the first one. Therefore, the synthetic research based on the long period of time has become a more and more influential study method. And only in this way, can we expand our research and make a more in-depth discussion on the Chinese literary enlightenment and the generating of modern literary current so as to grasp the multiple relationships between them. The origin of the Chinese literary enlightenment can not be separated from the Chinese enlightenment. First, the Chinese enlightenment is a kind of cultural enlightenment with historicity and totality. It is both modern and traditional. It has caused the interaction and compatibility of the modern orientation and the tradition continuation in the cultural enlightenment. How to avoid the dual opposition of understanding the cultural nature of the Chinese enlightenment also needs to refer to the theoretic thinking about cultural nature of the European enlightenment. Next, from the enlightenment of the study of Confucian classics to the literature, we can see that the evolution of the enlightenment mode in the Chinese enlightenment was undoubtedly happened under the historical background of the Chinese cultural development. Whether it is individual interpretation of the study of Confucian classics or the individual writing of literature will have relevant change with the cultural development. Therefore, the thought enlightenment,which has changed the individual choice from the study of Confucian classics to literature writing,has also showed process of thought evolution in the cultural enlightenment.Finally, the literary enlightenment specifically presents the modern orientation led by literary renovation. With the revitalizing of the enlightenment of the study of Confucian classics during the end of Qing Dynasty, the enlightenment mode has evolved from the study of Confucian classics to that of literature. Not only the enlightening group has been expanding from the scholars to writers, and the enlightening object from gentlemen to people, but also the mission of saving the nation from subjugation has been developed from the domestic revolution to the international anti-imperialism. Thus it has finally formed to the cultural tradition of enlightenment as saving the nation from subjugation. The initiation of modern literary current cannot be separated from the Chinese modernization. First, early in 1933, some people started to discuss ""the issue of the Chinese modernization"", which revealed the basic question that we had to solve for the Chinese modernization: the relations between the modern and tradition. The literary enlightenment is a traditional continuation of native culture based on the renovation of the cultural consciousness so that it can be adapted to the modern orientation of the foreign culture.This cultural characteristic of the Chinese modernization displays not only in the literary enlightenment, but also in the literature modernization.Next,there is an intrinsic relation between the literary enlightenment in China and drastically political change in China. After 1900, the Qing government had carried out a series of system transplanting which was objectively helpful to the social modernization, especially the modernization of the man in China.It facilitated not only the formation of independent thought, but also the disintegration of the ideological despotism to a certain degree. The man has come into the actual process of modernization as human beings. In conclusion, the generating of modern literary current in China has at the beginning maintained the intrinsic consistency with the literary enlightenment. The real outspread of literary enlightenment is inseparable from the modern renovation of the literary current.The transformation of literary idea has become the modern beginning of the self-enlightenment for the Chinese literary current. The whole revolution of the Chinese literature and the phased development of the literary enlightenment supplement each other. First, the wholeness of literature has experienced the complete evolution of the essential literary factors such as theme, genre, style and language, etc. By the end of Qing Dynasty, various kinds of insufficiencies that appeared in the beginning of the literary revolution in various circles, has directly affected the whole evolution of literature and exhibited the same nature. Both the literary thought resources and the ways of literary expressing have been mostly taken from the native traditional literature.Meanwhile, the literary revolution of various circles by the end of Qing Dynasty also displays the non-uniformity. The thought enlightenment of poetry and prose is restricted within the social elites, but the thought enlightenment of novel opens to the social populace. From revolution in the novel circle to the literary revolution, there is literary continuity that occurs on the level of essential literary factors between them. It has indicated that there exists homogeneity of the modern development of literature between the revolution of the novel circle by the end of Qing Dynasty and the literary revolution at the beginning of the Republic of China.Finally, the relationship between language and literature is fundamentally a cultural relationship. This relationship exists in human's language use from the whole process of literature writing to accepting. Therefore, the literary revolution is a creating process in which man gives life to literature by renewing language. The use of the word revolution has undoubtedly proved that the word may impel the language revolution of literature, and move to the thought revolution of enlightenment subsequently. There would be no individual prescience in literary enlightenment without the modern transformation of Chinese education. Firstly, the renovation of the Chinese education system started in 1901, and cleaned the path for the widespread of modern thought from other cultures. It has facilitated individual to make an independent choice in the literary enlightenment, and brought up the prescience community and the national community of enlightenment object. Thus it has effectively guaranteed the literary enlightenment in China.Secondly, the modern thought dissemination with overseas students as the medium, has become the basic premise for the full development of literary enlightenment in the course of cultural exchange between China and the West. This indicates that the generation of modern Chinese literary current derives from the absorption of the west learning. Due to the dissemination of modern thought generation after generation of the overseas students, the Chinese literary revolution is influenced in every respect. Finally, the prescient people made literary retrospection with the characteristic of pure thinking in the literary revolution of various circles at the end of Qing Dynasty, while in the literary revolution at the beginning of the Republic of China, they faced the requirement of reality and engaged in individual pondering. Thus, they have confirmed aesthetic essence of literature and determined modern development of literature. They promoted thorough outspread of the literary enlightenment, and facilitated the generation of modern Chinese literary current at the same time. The ""literature of human"" which becomes the main literary current has accepted the dissemination and the influence from the humanism. First, the native culture towards the traditional view of human is embodied by the consciousness of citizenship as ""the people are the foundation of the state"". During the process of literary enlightenment, the prescience takes humanism of the taking men as the center. The Chinese humanist ideal starts its construction through the modern transformation of the cultural consciousness from the consciousness of the citizenship to that of humanism. Next, the influence of native culture holds a strong position in the literary revolution of various circles at the end of Qing Dynasty. The traditional influence of the consciousness of citizenship has strengthened the political utilitarian nature of literary enlightenment, which causes the literature of ""renewing people"" to take a dominant position through the political teaching in the literary current. Finally, with the influence of the external culture became strong, the ""literature of human"" which is deeply influenced with humanism has become the mainstream during the generation of the modern Chinese literary current. But in the literary revolution movement,"" the life art school"" gradually occupied the dominant position of the literary current. The occurrence of literature utilization might cause literature tending to be a practical tool. Thus, from the generation of modern Chinese literary current, the main literary current has turned from the literature of ""renewing people"" to the ""literature of human"", as the literary revolution of various circles during the end of Qing turned to the literary revolution at the beginning of the Republic of China at the same time.Therefore, no matter it is the thought enlightenment in the literary enlightenment or the literary modernization in the literary vicissitude, either one has direct influence in the generation of the modern literary current. It has brought the Chinese phenomenon which the literary ideas evolution from old to new prior to the whole evolution of essential literary factors. This phenomenon not only indicates the consistent relationship between the evolution of literary ideas from old to new and the literary enlightenment, but also proves certain realistic inevitability that the individual thinking of literary theory takes precedence of the individual writing of literary creation during the generative process of the modern literary current. It is necessary as reasonable to the presciences in literary enlightenment. This can explain why the theory initiative has advanced in the movement of the literary revolution in China. So, the literary current may surge to facilitate the arising of literary movement. In this sense, the literary revolution in China is a literary war that is initiated by a number of people to subvert the tyrant's-like literary kingdom. Of course, we should not neglect the fact that it is the existence of the thought enlightenment of literary enlightenment in China that displays an constrained influence in the generation of the literary current, and triggers the self-enlightening of the prescience from culture to literature. Therefore, it is not a kind of historical inevitability to the literary vicissitude in China that the precedence of initiating literary theory over the writing of literary creation. It needs to study widely and deeply in future.",1024724024, 中国现代文学思潮生成论,Dissertations & Theses," Hao, Gong MingHaoMingGongHao, Gong Ming郝明工", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709717311 , 70434572 , 189128 , H117691 , H117691", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国现代文学思潮生成论,2005,PQDT - Global,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024724024?accountid=14496, 0298 Modern literature, 0298 Modern literature, 0298 Modern literature,, 0298 Modern literature, Modern literature," (UMI)AAIH117691 , Language, literature and linguistics , generation , literay enlightment , modern literay current , 文学启蒙 , 现代文学思潮 , 生成",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+DISCUSSION+ON+THE+GENERATION+OF+MODERN+CHINESE+LITERARY+CURRENT&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hao%2C+Gong+Ming&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3812,A Comprehensive Study of the Development of the CPC's Democratic Thoughts,"Before the foundation of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter CPC) the Chinese democratic revolution has been occurred. The Chinese revolution has been continued for several decades before CPC has become the major revolution force in Chinese political arena. The Revolution under the leadership of CPC has been the continuation of the Chinese democratic revolution indeed. Therefore, the following characteristic background for the foundation of CPC goes as: firstly, its long period of living in isolation and its serious political corruption have caused the under development of Chinese economy and thus the level of the productive forces for the development of democracy in China is kept really low; secondly, the invasion of the Imperial Powers has robbed China of its sovereignty as well as the independence of the Chinese nation; thirdly, the 1911 Revolution (Xinhaigemin) has overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China, but the newly born Republic of China headed by Jiang Jieshi later has turned into the regime of big landlords and bourgeoisie. It has not paved the way for the development of Chinese National Capitalism, but threw itself into the lap of Imperial Powers to suppress the development of Chinese National Capitalism. The nature of its Class has determined itself to fail to set down the right policy for the classes and politics in China so as to complete an effective political conformity of the Chinese society. Therefore, after the establishment of the Republic of China, the whole country still remains disintegrated, and the Chinese people still live an extremely poor life, let alone their independence and democratic rights in China. In 1917, the October Revolution in Russia won its victory and then it has brought Marxism into China. With its revolutionary and scientific and practical features, the Marxism has been accepted by the progressive intellectuals in China, therefore, CPC has come into being which has been the product of the combination of Marxism and Chinese revolutionary practices. Since its foundation, CPC has been guided by the Marxist proletariat revolutionary thoughts and struggled for the ideal of Communism. CPC has worked out the proletariat revolutionary strategy, adopted the democratic principles of Marxism, established the Marxist Party and Army and led Chinese people to carry on the democratic revolution in China. During the Chinese revolution, with the combination of democratic thoughts of Marxism and the revolutionary practice in China led by CPC, the CPC democratic thoughts have come into being. Thereafter the CPC democratic thoughts have been developing. This dissertation aims at making a comprehensive study of the CPC democratic thoughts in six chapters. Chapter one has discussed the establishment of CPC democratic thoughts. The CPC democratic thoughts set the Marxist democratic thoughts as its core with the background of particular Chinese revolution and rich Chinese Civilization. Therefore, the establishment of CPC democratic thoughts have been influenced by the following three forces: Marxist democratic thoughts, capitalist democratic thoughts, and the Chinese traditional thoughts such as “human-oriented and rule of virtue”. Since the establishment of the CPC democratic thoughts have come into being in the course of democratic revolution, it has presented itself with two features: adopting to conditions of Chinese revolution and responding to the task of the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, China has remained as no independence to the outside and no sovereignty inside, its people has lived in extremely poverty. Just like the famous scholar in Peking University, Prof. Guan Haiting pointed out in his writing, The Review of History of 20th Century Chinese Political Development, as to the Chinese people living in such a poor life, democracy has become a real luxury in their life, the first thing to do for the Chinese people at that time should be conducting the revolution to save the nation in peril, therefore, the Chinese democratic movement often serves as the tool to save the nation in peril and it remains not as its aim at all. That is why we can say that the CPC democratic thoughts have the revolutionary feature from its very beginning. The CPC democratic thoughts has developed with the focus of conducting Chinese revolution and taking the regime for the revolution, and with its aim of capturing the victory of the revolution in China and establishing of the new democratic state. Therefore the CPC democratic thoughts have been embodied as the concrete revolutionary strategy and tactics, such as “the mass line” and “united front”. As to the periods of establishment and development of the CPC democratic thoughts, the period from the foundation of CPC to the victory of new democratic revolution is the most important period for the primary establishment of the CPC democratic thoughts. Chapter two has talked about the development of the CPC democratic thoughts. Before the foundation of the People’s Republic of China, what kind of state-ship and government should be established in China has become an urgent task for CPC. At that time, guided by Marxist thought of Proletariat dictatorship and based on the practical condition of China, the CPC has creatively brought forward the People’s democratic dictatorship which guided the new China to establish the state-ship of the People’s democratic dictatorship and its basic democratic system, and has pave the way for the socialist democratic system in the way of government guarantee. In addition, CPC has guided Chinese people to pass the first basic law, namely, the Constitution in China in 1954. The Constitution has stipulated the state system of the People’s democratic dictatorship in China, the system of government of people’s congress, the basic democratic system of multi –nationality, the system of multi-party co-operation and democratic supervision, and democracy at basic levels. It has also regulated people’s basic democratic rights which has embodied the CPC democracy and democratic legal system thoughts. At the same time, CPC has led people to conduct the economic building and set the first five-year plan and the target of industrial development which has lain a solid base for the establishment of the socialist democratic system and embodied the CPC thought that the productive forces is the base for development of democracy. After foundation of People’s Republic of China (PRC), the state system of People’s democratic dictatorship is of the new democracy. During that period, the public ownership as the dominated position in the national economy has not established, and there are also five kinds of economic forces in the country’s economy which are not of the socialism. Guided by the ideal of the socialist democracy, CPC has renewed national economy and put forward their transition towards the socialist economy. CPC has regulated this transition into the Constitution which is the embodiment of CPC’s building of socialist democracy in China. The transition towards the socialist economy, the CPC democratic thoughts has also developed into the socialist democratic thoughts. After “the Three Great Remould” movements, namely, movements of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, China has established the socialist democracy system and pushed the development of the CPC democratic thoughts into that of the Socialist democracy thoughts. This period has been the period of establishing and developing of CPC socialist democracy and legal system thoughts with its focus of creation of people’s democratic dictatorship, transition towards the socialism, paving the way for building of socialism and making perfect the legal system. Chapter three has focused on the ups and downs of the CPC democratic thoughts. After the completion of “the Three Great Remould” movements, the new system of socialism has been established in China. The development of Chinese democracy and that of the CPC democratic thoughts both have been based on the socialism thereafter. Before and after “the 8th CPC National Congress”, the CPC has made a lot of exploration in the way of how to improve and develop the socialist democracy. The CPC has found more problems and studied more issues. For example,, Mr. Mao Zedong has discussed how to balance the relation between the central government and the local government in his On the Ten Major Relations and on its related discussions. In the field of scientific work, the CPC has adopted the guideline of “letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend”, developed a policy of “long-term co-existence and mutual supervision” with other democratic parties, and formed the thought of “handling correctly the contradictions among the people” and so on. During September 15-27, 1956, the 8th CPC National Congress was held in Beijing which was held with the background of the victory of the socialism and the realization of its fundamental change of social conditions in China. The congress has reflected the status of the every social class and Chinese changes in their political, cultural and economic senses. The congress has summed up the experiences of the People’s democratic dictatorship as well as of constructing the newly socialist democracy. More importantly, the congress was held after the 20th National Congress of Communist Party of the Soviet Union and has discussed the malpractice of the Soviet Union Mode and stressed the issue of the development of democracy and brought forward many thoughts and strategies of constructing the socialist democracy. But due to the pressing economic development and the threat from the international capitalism, due to the unilateralism of developing the economy and due to the influence of the malpractice of the Soviet Union Mode, the “Left” mistakes have occurred in the CPC and the thoughts of the 8th National Congress has been given up in the practice of socialist construction. During the transformation to the socialist construction, the development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been misled and the “Left” thought in CPC has been spread unchecked and prevented the development of the socialist democracy and led to the happening of the tragedy of “Cultural Revolution”. Chapter four has stressed the recovery and the development of the CPC democratic thoughts. The opening of 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the CPC has indicated the ending of the “Left” errors in CPC. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the CPC has resumed the Marxist thought line of “seeking truth from the facts” and renewed the correct thought of how to develop the socialist democratic thoughts around the 8th National Congress of CPC. During the correction of the “Left” errors, CPC has set forth the Four Fundamental Principles (the socialist road, the People’s democratic dictatorship, Marxist-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thoughts and the leadership of the CPC) which guide the construction of the socialist democracy. Along the correct guideline of “seeking the truth from facts”, the CPC has set forth the thoughts of reforming system. As to the economic system, the CPC has brought forward the central task of the economic construction and come back to the road of Marxist idea that “the productive forces have been the base for the development of democracy. Constructing the socialist democracy must be needed to enhance the construction of the legal system and democratic system, and make the democratic system institutionalized and legalized so that to meet the requirement of extending democracy and of constructing the socialist modernization. The CPC has brought forth the thought of reforming the system of cadre leadership which starts to the prologue of reforming the political system. Chapter five has detailed the comprehensive development of the CPC democratic thoughts. On the 12th National Congress of CPC, the CPC has stated the importance of developing democracy from the overall situation of constructing the socialist modernization. The CPC headed By Mr. Deng Xiaoping has changed the modernization development strategy from its unilateralism of developing the economy into the comprehensive one, in other words, modernization in China means not only the modernization of economy, but also the modernization of politics and culture. The CPC has also set forth the task of building our great motherland into a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country. Thereafter the CPC democratic thoughts has finally shook off from its thinking of revolution and stepped into the suitable track of developing the socialist democracy in China, set out the strategy of comprehensive development of the society and has made the democracy as one of the developing target of the whole development of the society. The reforming of the political system has officially brought forward only after the primary success of the economic reforming. With the deepening economic system reform, the former political system has not met the development of economy. In order to liberate the productive forces and shake off the bondage of related superstructure, the 13th National Congress of CPC has stressed the thought of reforming the political system. On the 13th National Congress of CPC, the CPC has stated the thought of reforming the political system in a comprehensive way which is the further advance in developing the CPC democratic thoughts. With the further development of reforming and opening-up, the CPC has continued its exploration in developing the socialism and later the CPC has developed the theory that China was in the primary stage of socialism and the thought of the socialist commodity economy and further developed into forming the new theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Among which building the socialist democratic thoughts with Chinese characteristics has become the advancement of the CPC democratic thoughts. With the guideline of building the socialist democratic thoughts with Chinese characteristics, the CPC has formed its reform thought of political system with the base of “adhering to and improving the socialist democracy system” in its practice of political reforms. With the advancement in legal system construction and publication of democracy, the CPC has developed into the thought of “ruling with law and constructing the socialist legal country”. After the successes in reforms in economic and political systems and with the start of building a well-off society in an all-round way, the CPC has pointed out the new thought of development of political civilization as its democratic thoughts. The development of political civilization has come into being with the development of the times and it is the requirement for the CPC to build a well-off society in an all-round way and it is also the advancement of CPC democratic thoughts. In terms of its contents, the development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been centered on how to reform and improve the basic system of the socialism, and the development stage is its mature period for the CPC democratic thoughts. Chapter six has summed up the path and characteristics of the CPC democratic thoughts. The development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been influenced by many factors, such as social conditions for the economy, people’s education level, people’s knowledge of law, and democratic practice. It is clear that the CPC democratic thoughts have been a combination of many factors. With the influence of these factors, the CPC democratic thoughts have gained their characteristics: people’s democratic dictatorship, socialism, adaptation to the revolution and construction, keeping on developing and so on. In general, the various stages of the CPC democratic thoughts have indicated a progressive course in which the latter stage has advanced with the base of the former. From the revolution period to the socialist construction period, the CPC democratic thoughts have adapted to the requirement of revolution first and then of socialist construction, and experienced the following stages: from the democratic thoughts of the revolutionary party to that of the party in power, from its stress on seizing the victory of the revolution and creating new system to stressing the socialist systematic construction and legal development, from its stressing that democracy should be submitted to the needs of revolution and economic construction to the idea that the democracy construction has become the important part of collective targets of socialist construction. In the part of conclusion, this dissertation has stressed again that the CPC democratic thoughts have been guided by the ideal of communism and developed with the direction of socialist democratic practice, in other words, the CPC democratic thoughts have developed with the direction of communist ideal and also with the direction of socialist practice which reflects that the basic law of Chinese Socialist democracy development led by the CPC, namely, from its ideal to its practice, and again from its practice to its ideal. Therefore, not only from the viewpoint of the CPC democratic thoughts, but also from the practice guided by the CPC democratic thoughts, the ideal is not far from us, our theory could give us strong motivation an push us forwards our ideal; as long as we strive for our ideal with heart and soul, we human beings could step into the glorious future of Communism.",1025010154, 中国共产党民主思想发展研究,Dissertations & Theses," Lu, YiLuYiLu, Yi卢轶", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711563571 , 70481472 , 189128 , H150165 , H150165", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国共产党民主思想发展研究,2005,PQDT - Global,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1025010154?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH150165 , Social sciences , 中国共产党、民主思想、、the CCP、democratic thoughts、",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Comprehensive+Study+of+the+Development+of+the+CPC%27s+Democratic+Thoughts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lu%2C+Yi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3813,Research for auto consumer finance--With analysis and suggestion to auto consumer finance in China,"The huge demand for capital is recognized as main characteristics of auto industry for many reasons to sustain manufacture and sales.

The Sino-Soviet relation has gone through forming an alliance and following honeymoon in the fifties, and develop into the breaking of the national relation and party relationship in the sixties. The development of the Sino-Soviet relation, especially the rupture of Sino-Soviet relation has caused inestimable losses to the international communist movement and the two countries at that time. The international communist movement is split greatly, and move towards the low ebb progressively. Two Sino-Soviet countries fall foul of each other, which have caused a series of questions such as the border and national conflict, etc. It causes the incomparable negative effect to both sides' politics, economic and foreign relations. Why did Sino-Soviet relation change so deeply within so transient time? Especially it is beyond belief that more and more prosperous Sino-Soviet relation on the surface "" suddenly ""reaches the situation that national relation is serious damaged, and party relationship totally breaks. In the initial stage when the Sino-Soviet relation breaks, Sino-Soviet both sides shirk responsibilities to the other side. Both sides at that time explain from one's own ideology, and attack the other side's ideology faith each other so as to prove itself is the Marxism-Leninism orthodox school. With the development of time and the open of the relevant files material, especially since latter half of 1990s, more and more scholars begin to care about the real reason of Sino-Soviet splitting, and put forward such national benefit say, ideology say, leader individual say, development path say etc. At the same time those who go through the Sino-Soviet splitting in those years have mentioned the Sino-Soviet reason by way of having an informal discussion and memoir from different angles. This text attempts to catch two threads that run through Sino-Soviet related to development tightly: National benefit close and conflict, unity and difference of ideology, finding the reason that relation breaks in concerning from national benefit and interdynamic of ideology. The full text divides into four chapters altogether: Chapter one sketch the course that the Sino-Soviet relation breaks, and the research results of the reason about breaking both at home and abroad in recent years mainly; Chapter two proceed with explanation of the national benefit, introduce the Sino-Soviet both sides' different explanation to each country's benefit. With forming an alliance relation for big background, it discusses the maintaining for prerequisite with alliance national foundation reason of benefit while being Sino-Soviet. Considering from geopolitics, national security strategy, national relation normal form, social economic development, etc. several respect probe into in form an alliance with honeymoon national unanimous and conflict of interests, both sides of stage, while being Sino-Soviet, And the sharp collision of the Sino-Soviet national benefit of latter half of the fifties of the 20th century; Chapter three attempt to probe into ideology and dispute, which has the malignant influence on the Sino-Soviet national relation from another aspect. Mainly from both sides heavy difference such as the Soviet Communist Party 20 heavy, Stalin issue, three peace route, development path headed by Soviet to explain the really essential of ideology difference, and to dispute the enormous destruction function on the relations of both ideology.

The theory meaning studied lies in order to build and construct the theory system which knows new development in science and technology, offer the new analysis vision ; Practice meaning lies in submitting to the policymaker of our country while making the technological innovation strategy, should watch out for digital disparity , information is unjust , such new-type social contradictions as knowledge splits up ; Carry out the social goal of the affinity to the people of knowledge and policy system of the social development conscientiously, real representative's vastest people's basic benefit. Just the rational thinking of the strategic choice of technological innovation was launched in this text. This text divides three chapters altogether. Chapter one consists some of theoretical foundation of the strategic choice method of technological innovation. This chapter, to technological determinism, it criticize society theory, after construct there aren't doctrine and Marx materialist conception of history building by knowledge theory , society, clarifying different theories school will make the rational composition to the technological innovation strategy. Regard Marx's materialist conception of history as the basic program , the rational kernel with the main schools of thought complemented, refine and make three basic categories of technological innovation strategy: Globality , independence and affinity to the people. Chapter this to extend as clue with reason at first, through teach beginners reach rational hegemony modern reason, criticize from rational value neutrality to technological reason, to technological "" morbid state society "" and each criticism of aspect of "" alienation of people "" that reason bring, form by society already it last school line of demarcation not different of theory,not for instance alienation theory , Frank school not technological of Marx, behind modernism,etc. It is still western major ideology that technology rules the theory at present, its advance and independence of paying attention to technical development, as to developing economy fast, have certain reference function. The society criticizes the theory and emphasizes the humane care to people, have positive meanings to the globality of choosing globality development strategy of technological innovation. And then the modern knowledge theory is about the scientific diversified thought of culture , having meaning of building to the independence of technological innovation. Society is it construct theory emphasize productivity especially science and technology whether society of people is it construct to build to build, society build technological democracy to construct doctrine is it check development strategy of affinity to the people in technological innovation have realistic meanings inside rationally to wait. Chapter two explains the evolution of the technological innovation theory from theory aspect at first, technological innovation theory develop into from economics concept, bear of Peter society is it construct national innovative system of theory to build already. It construct from society theory think national innovative body have globality , independence and affinity to the people to build, regulate the function that the market does not work and the government does not work. Is it combine together in terms of the view to construct materialist conception of history and society , regard national innovative system as carriers to build secondly, analyse the contemporary forms of productivity and contradiction movement of relations of production in era of knowledge-driven economy, so as to announce the display form of the social basic contradiction of knowledge. Namely what knowledge natural instinct socialization and knowledge occupied is not the dialectical relation between socialization; Contemporary western development relies on the whole world of knowledge to spread the high concentration with knowledge power , cause "" knowledge disparity "" between the developed country and the third world. The disequilibrium of development of the world is shown as "" digital divide "" expanded outstandingly day by day, form new global gap between rich and poor in information age. We should choose the globality of technological innovation , the development strategies of the independence and affinity to the people , watch out for globalization and conceal knowledge monopolizing and knowledge hegemony which some developed countries follow , prevent from from "" technology rely on "" to the political trap where "" sovereignty rely on "". Chapter three regards developed industrial country and newly industrializing country as the system of consulting , analyse one by one about its economic development and technological innovation strategy mode. The theory that the developed country has finished technical revolution of modern science without any confusion in 100 solid years is created and melted, research and development , new and high technology industrialization and globalization ,etc. develop the step, pay attention to the independence and globality of technological innovation on the technological innovation strategy, is it raise manpower capital competence through education to put emphasis on , realize economic catching up with and surpassing. It is an important means that the newly industrializing country catches up with and surpasses with technology, pursue the advance of technology. Developing countries generally adopt the depending on mode in economic development, lack independence on the technological innovation strategy. Though the former Soviet Union has scientific and technological advantages , has not handled the relation between the technology and affinity to the people well . China is walking while new and industrialized, is building and constructing the socialist harmonious society, must regard Deng Xiaoping Theory , important thought of 'Three Represents' and scientific development view as the guidelines , insist on the public and private unity of opposites of scientific and technical innovation, unity of opposites of the global and national characteristic, unity of opposites of technology import and autonomous innovation unity of opposites , economic growth and core technological ability unity of opposites , humane care and scientific and technological progress.",1026766346, 技术创新战略的理性思考与模式选择,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Hua DanZhangDanHuaZhang, Hua Dan张丹华", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713886351 , 70559982 , 189128 , H267867 , H267867", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, Chinese, Chinese, 技术创新战略的理性思考与模式选择,2005,PQDT - Global,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026766346?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAIH267867 , Social sciences , 战略 , 技术创新 , 模式",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rational+Thinking+of+Technological+innovation+Strategy+and+Choice+of+Pattern&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Hua+Dan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3816,The Vicissitudes Of Society In Nanxun Of China,"In this article,the author researches a town named Nanxun in Hangjiahu Plain in the northern part of Zhejiang province.Under the background of natural exploitation and human development of Taihu Basin,and the clue of rise and fall of silk industry since modern times,the paper describes the social changes of this special area during about a hundred years, analyzes the inside and outside factors of the silk industy's vicissitudes,as well as the ups and downs of businessmen' colony of Nanxun, and ulteriorly discusses the changes in the fields of social economy and culture in China. This thesis discusses the developing process of the silk industry and economy of the town in Nanxun.It divides the process into three stages,namely,before the Opium War,after the Opium War to late 19th century,from late 19th century to 1937. Before the Opium War,the development of chinese silk industry mainly relys on domestic demand.After that until late 19th century,export and domestic sales have half each.After late 19th century,export sales are a large proportion. Since late 19th century ,the economy in Nanxun has developed continually and reach a peak between in the 1920s and 1930s,especially in the 1920s.Traditional rural professional economy makes great progress under the situation of new international trade and brings an unprecedented prosperity for Nanxun.After traditional handicraft industry fails to compete with machine produce of modern China,all kinds of ""new""cottage industries rise up and temporarily recuperate after traditional handicraft's losses. Because of a close contact with international trade,on one hand,the traditional handicraft can develop rapidly,consequently brings the prosperity of the town.On the other hand,it also falls into a decline because of the changes of international market. During this process, the author points out several outstanding essentials: First of all,the impetus to promote economic growth of Nanxun mostly comes from the international demands for raw silk.Since the opening of five treaty ports and the evolution of the Shanghai port,the demands act directly on this area and make it develop continually. Secondly,as interior power goes,the fateful improvement happens in the 1870s,that is to say,castle silk is weaved into silk so as to export.The improving course is passive,not active.With the rise of machine silk industry,Nanxun finally falls into a producing area of the materials -----pods. Thridly,we should notice the private mode of operation based on the family,which has continued for several thousand years.Not only the agricultural economy of the combination of plough and weaving in Pre-Modem,but also a variety of machining industries rising in rural areas,the mode of operation regarding the family as a basic unit has never changed. Thus it can be seen that the rural economy of towns always behaves to accommodate ""passively"" itself to the western civilization in the face of the western civilization that modern industry is a representative of it.It hardly happens to affiliate contemporary factors to the commodities and the mode of operation. Therefore,as a traditional town,Nanxun is a representative of Jiangnan towns because of its great rise and fall.Its prosperity relys on the traditional silk industry and the trade of ""Huzhou silk""rising from the industry.The demands for castle silk of market abroad impulse its development.Further more,the opening of five treaty ports and the repid evolution of the Shanghai port give Nanxun the chance to improve.When facing the western civilization,the town hardly has a desire to take adventage of the new technology for itself.It even laughs at the machine silk industry,and is still immersed in reeling silk with indigenous method.Therefore,its decline is a inevitable result of the development of modern silk technology.It is just the modern silk industry which seizes the oversea market in the first instance and then domestic market.Finally it makes the traditional silk industry decline. The modern fate of Nanxun is just the same as the fate of the traditional silk industry of China to a certain extent.

Accordingly, the social effects of religions extend greatly, social contradictions caused by the interweaving of religious and ethnic issues are more severe than ever, and hostile forces outside infiltrate in the internal religious affairs further. All the matters above raise new problems in the management of religions, even its power wielding methods and founding for the Communist Party of China (CPC). Thus, we should sum up the CPC’s theory on religions and its policies as well, and its experiences and lessons. In my opinion, it is a significant theoretic and practical issue for the proper understanding and management of China’s religions, for the unification of the Nation as a whole, the stability of the society, and the development of the socialist modernization undertakings. The dissertation is composed of six parts, which would be summarized respectively in the following. The Introduction of the dissertation summarizes religions and its social effects in the Old China, and Marxist views on religions and its communication in China at that period and the CPC’s theories and policies concerned before the foundation of the People’s Republic of China. There are many religions in China, for example, Buddhism, Daoism, Islamism, Catholicism, Christianism, Orthodox Church and other religions of certain minorities, or local beliefs. In the Old China, almost every religions had been controlled and exploited by the ruling classes and accordingly had some negative effects. Since the October Revolution of the Russia, Marxism entered into China, and CPC members such as Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao and Yun Daiying introduced Marxist views on the origins, the evolution and the social effects of religions. Before 1949, the main task of the CPC was to struggle for liberation and independence of Chinese people from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The CPC must solidify all possible forces to make final success, how to unite people from religious cycle became a practical issue for the CPC. According to the needs of national liberation and the characteristics of the religions themselves, the CPC began to form patriotic and anti-imperial united front with the religious cycle, , and the CPC began to accept the principle of religious belief freedom and the views on how to manage religions. Chapter One of the dissertation studies the CPC’s theoretic views and policies on religions during the period of 1949 to 1956. It was the period of China’s socialist transition. Abided by the general line for the transition period, and by publicizing further the Marxist theory of religion, the CPC summed up the five characters of religion, that is, long-termed, mass-driven, ethnical, international and complicated characters. The cognition became the foundations of CPC’s policies towards religious affairs during the period. In the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, the principle of religious belief freedom had been erected. As for the specific policies, the CPC made religious reform to apply to the New Society. At the very initial stage of the period, the imperial forces exploited Catholicism and Christianism in resistance against the New China, so the CPC led the autonomy, self-communication and self-supporting movement of the two religions, so as to break off all relations of the two religions with the imperialism. To get rid of the feudal vestiges in Buddhism and Daoism, the CPC first suppressed the anti-revolutionary remnant forces in the temples, and stressed the patriotic education of the Buddhists and Daoists; and then got rid of the feudal land property system and patriarchal management system, and carried out democratic management system; thirdly, organized the Buddhists and Daoists to participate in production activities and to earn their own livings. Islamism and Lamaism were two main religions in the minority regions of China. For the stability of the newly-established state power and the undeveloped consciousness of the ethnical mass, though the integration pf church and state of the two religions could not adapt to the needs of the New China, CPC adopted modest policy on the democratic reform of the two religions, accordingly, the reform of Islamism began in 1958, and that of the Lamaism began in 1959, and the reform succeeded by the end of 1960, and the feudal prerogatives and exploitation system had been got rid of, and all religious believers were liberalized from the oppress and exploitation of the religious feudalism, thus promoting the political, economic and cultural development and ethnical unity. In sum, the religious reform led by CPC at the beginning and the first stage of the PRC was surly a success, whose achievements should be affirmed. ……..",1027907445, 建国以来中国共产党宗教理论和政策研究,Dissertations & Theses," Hu, JunHuJunHu, Jun胡军", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721214461 , 70498722 , 189128 , H149666 , H149666", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, Chinese, Chinese, 建国以来中国共产党宗教理论和政策研究,2005,PQDT - Global,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027907445?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH149666 , Social sciences , 中国共产党、宗教理论、、CPC、Theory on Religions、",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=CPC%E2%80%99s+Theory+on+Religions+and+Its+Policy+Implications%3A1949+to+Present&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hu%2C+Jun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3818,The study of Chinatown as an urban artifice and its impact on the Chinese community in London,"Sociologists claim that the ethnic Chinese community in the United Kingdom cannot be spatially defined. The first reason is that the widely scattered Chinese catering businesses-still the main source of employment for incoming Chinese migrants - makes the Chinese community too dispersed to form residential enclaves. Secondly, the evasive nature of the ethnic Chinese population towards government assistance and strong sense of ethnic solidarity also makes them an ""invisible community"". The Confucian philosophy governing their way of life further reinforces patrilineal links oriented towards ancestral villages in China. Recent renewed interests in the future of London's Chinatown as the result of a recent development plan has prompted this report to investigate whether a spatial pattern of occupation by the Chinese community exists in Chinatown, or if it is simply an intelligent urban artifice exploited for touristic and commercial purposes. Unlike its historical East End predecessor which has never been exclusively Chinese, present day London Chinatown can be qualified as a ""persistent enclave"". Whilst it crucially accommodates co-ethnic businesses and facilities for the oriental population, it is not the sole centre for the Chinese community. At the outset, studies on the Chinese have been confounded by their lack of assimilation into host society, inconsistent methods of data representation from the population census and high levels of suspicion by the immigrant community when conducting fieldwork. By first understanding historical developments in London's two Chinatowns and concepts pertaining to Chinese ethnography, this helps substantiate the demographic data, changing land use and household occupation by the Chinese community in Limehouse around 1890 and Soho today. The global and local relationship for these two areas are also analysed syntactically through spatial maps derived from Booth's Map of Poverty of 1889 and a current axial map of London respectively. The spatially-oriented case study of Soho's Chinatown identifies through a public survey a collective mental representation of its neighbourhood area that differs from its administrative designation. Pedestrian movement studies suggest that there is a distinct spatial and temporal pattern of occupation amongst the ethnic Chinese which differs from non-Chinese tourists and locals which can be syntactically measured. The findings support the view that a complex social and spatial relationship exists between the two disparate groups that utilise Chinatown. Whilst its commercial success is crucial to maintaining Chinatown's public profile, it also allows it to continue to function as an important centre for the Chinese community.",1430534386,,Dissertations & Theses," Chung, Simone Shu-YengChungShu-YengSimoneChung, Simone Shu-Yeng", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3064859071 , 81519282 , 189128 , 9781303418686 , U594300 , U594300", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005, 9781303418686, English, English,,2005,PQDT - Global,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430534386?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," (UMI)AAIU594300 , Social sciences , Chinatown , Chinese community , London",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+study+of+Chinatown+as+an+urban+artifice+and+its+impact+on+the+Chinese+community+in+London&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chung%2C+Simone+Shu-Yeng&amp;isbn=9781303418686&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3819,"Trade unions, strategic pedagogy and globalisation: learning from the anti-privatisation struggles of sintraemcali","The thesis explores trade union resistance to neo-liberal globalisation through a case-study of the strategic development of Sintraemcali (the trade union of the Municipal Enterprises of Cali) in Colombia. Sintraemcali, since the mid 1990's, has fought off a series of attempts by the Colombian government to privatise the public utilities of water, electricity and telecommunications. Drawing on Burawoy's (1998) Extended Case Method the research is based on 16 months of participatory ethnographic fieldwork and develops a critical theory approach to researching `globalisation from below' through drawing on the work of the Neo-Gramscian School and that of Boaventura de Sousa Santos. The thesis focuses on one particular episode of protest - the 36 day CAM Tower Occupation that began on December 25th, 2001 - in order to understand the conditions that enabled this event to come about. This episode of protest linked workers and local communities in mass protest and operated on a range of scales from the local to the global. The thesis explores how this multi-scalar strategy developed. The thesis traces the historical development of these strategies and explores Sintraemcali's transformation during the 1990's from a corporate trade union fighting for the particular interests of its affiliates to a social movement union defending the broader interests of the local community. The transformation of the trade union took place under the difficult conditions of Colombia where trade unions and human rights activists are regularly subject to assassination by state and para-state forces. Through a reconceptualisation of `trade union education' the thesis argues that Sintraemcali's transformation can be understood as a pedagogical process. The main argument put forward is that the emergence of a strategic pedagogy within the union facilitated the development of a broad multi-scalar strategy that included: (1) an alternative economic strategy for the management of Emcali; (2) a trade union/ community alliance within the city of Cali in defence of public services; (3) a mobilisation strategy which included a series of militant occupations of high profile buildings; and, (4) a human rights strategy that provided access to local, national and international legal and advocacy mechanisms that facilitated Sintraemcali's ability to globalise its struggle against privatisation. The research isolates two key pedagogical processes at work that serve to modify the context within which Sintraemcali operated: transborderisation and horiiontalisation. The first challenges the view that labour organisations can only operate at the local scale and highlights how, through a multi-scalar pedagogy, Sintraemcali members and allies developed new skills, knowledge and strategies that enabled them to operate on a range of scales from the local to the global. The second pedagogical process, horiiontalisation, highlights the rearticulation of trade union objectives towards an ethic of citizenship and human rights. This allowed for the development of a more reciprocal relationship between the trade union, social movements, and marginalised communities at a range of geographical scales.",1821104825,,Dissertations & Theses," Novelli, MarioNovelliMarioNovelli, Mario", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4187393201 , 45107651 , 101309 , U190418 , U190418 , http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/theses/trade-unions-strategic-pedagogy-and-globalisation-learning-from-the-antiprivatisation-struggles-of-sintraemcali(b097efa0-602b-4f90-804d-8aa56d9d1f6b).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1821104825?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/theses/trade-unions-strategic-pedagogy-and-globalisation-learning-from-the-antiprivatisation-struggles-of-sintraemcali(b097efa0-602b-4f90-804d-8aa56d9d1f6b).html , DXN080986 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trade+unions%2C+strategic+pedagogy+and+globalisation%3A+learning+from+the+anti-privatisation+struggles+of+sintraemcali&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Novelli%2C+Mario&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3820,"The look of Ireland: The representation of Ireland in Gael Linn's “Amharc Éireann” film series, 1956–1964","Gael Linn's Amharc Éireann (literally translated as Look at Ireland ) film series began in 1956 as monthly short documentary films on topics of domestic interest and was transformed in 1959 to weekly newsreels. It was a cultural nationalist project sponsored by Gael Linn, a newly-formed Irish language protection organization whose mandate was the revitalisation of the Irish language through the use of modern media and technology, and produced by Colm Ó Laoghaire, a member of a well-known Irish literary and nationalist family (the Plunketts). Created during a period of rapid social, economic and political change, it reflects and records the dramatic transformation of Ireland from a rural, underdeveloped and relatively isolated nation into a modern member of the international economic and political community. As the first and longest-running Irish-language documentary and news-film series, Amharc Éireann represented the attempt on the part of a few committed Irish-language enthusiasts to present Ireland to the Irish in a way that would instill a sense of pride in the country, and to promote the language in a way that the public would accept. Irish-language productions and non-fiction film are both relatively under-researched areas of study. This dissertation analyzes the context, production, reception and content of the series, establishing its contemporary significance and its relation to the Irish language revival movement by critically dissecting the image of Ireland that Gael Linn and Ó Laoghaire constructed. As the first investigation of the Amharc Éireann series as an historical artefact, it broadens the field of Irish cultural history. By focusing on non-fiction film, it expands the popular conception of film studies. By looking at the promotion of the Irish language and culture through modern media, it examines the construction and reflection of Irish identity in the 20 th century.",287869659,,Dissertations & Theses," Pratschke, B.

The thesis argues that contemporary global governance is characteristic of the construction of a specifically neo-liberal hegemony but that this is characterised by two distinct phases.  While the first was disciplinary in nature and concerned to dismantle a previously embedded hegemonic world order, second-phase strategies aim to contain the crisis tendencies generated by first-phase reform, embedding capitalist hegemony over the long-term.  The deployment of these second-phase strategies by agencies bearing a degree of relative autonomy at domestic, macro-regional and global levels is considered in depth through three case study chapters.",301631421,,Dissertations & Theses," Nunn, A.NunnA.Nunn, A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760668881 , 45106481 , 101309 , U213425 , U213425 , http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/1222/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301631421?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/1222/ , (UMI)AAIU213425 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+economy+of+crisis+and+global+governance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nunn%2C+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3822,"British expatriate belonging in dubai: foreignness, domesticity, intimacy","This thesis analyses expatriate belonging through an ethnography of the British in Dubai. As an account of diasporic or transnational belonging, it is fully grounded in the complexity of everyday lives. This is achieved by exploring expatriate experiences of foreignness, domesticity and intimacy, three thematic strands that are attentive to contemporary theory in their recognition that belonging is embodied, material and emotional respectively. Each of the ethnographic chapters contributes to particular theoretical literatures. Focussing on the construction and enactment of foreignness in the daily lives of expatriates, the first chapter situates the British within Dubai's complex, racialised, social hierarchy and draws on theories of `whiteness' and an unsettling, bodily, experience of `culture shock', to complicate our understanding of expatriate racisms. In the second ethnographic chapter, the thesis explores domestic material culture in British expatriates' homes, analysing belongings and the homemaking practices in which they are involved, including display, remembering, shopping and cleaning. The third part of the thesis highlights the emotional geographies of expatriate intimacy as they are negotiated transnationally and within Dubai in (gendered) practices of relatedness, conjugality, conviviality, friendship and dating. Finally, a personal reflection on the ethnographic research experience also links my experience of ethnographic fieldwork closely into these themes. More generally then, by using this theoretical trinity combined with ethnographic research, the thesis illuminates the interdependence of the (trans)national and local, the material and imagined, as well as movement and attachment, in the everyday complexity of lived belonging. It is argued that British expatriate belonging is characterised by multiplicity, ambivalence and everyday negotiative effort.",301640447,,Dissertations & Theses," Walsh, Katie JoanWalshJoanKatieWalsh, Katie Joan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760428461 , 45056991 , 101309 , U194699 , U194699", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301640447?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," DXN088472 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=British+expatriate+belonging+in+dubai%3A+foreignness%2C+domesticity%2C+intimacy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walsh%2C+Katie+Joan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3823,"Struggling toward a new earth: the integration of faith and development practice within christian aid with particular reference to a brazilian partner, centro de estudos e ação social","This thesis addresses the following question: what is the Christian contribution that a faith-based agency such as Christian Aid brings to development practice. It explores the integration of theological reflection with development work and advocacy in two faith-based organisations: Christian Aid (CA), a UK relief and development organisation and one of its overseas partners, Centro de Estudos e Ação Social (CEAS), a Brazilian Jesuit-based community development organisation. Such a question has been overlooked by many people working within development in the North but is often central to agencies in the South. Stemming from liberation theology, this thesis argues that the practice of these organisations is both developmental (economic, political, and cultural) and theological. It analyses two components arising out of the integration of faith and development. The first component is the methodology of action and reflection, the hermeneutic circle, that these organisations follow. The second is the content, the issues, emerging from the reflection. The first chapter analyses the method of the hermeneutic circle. This circle critically reflects in community on reality and spirituality, each in the light of the other. This thesis followed a similar method in its formation. The practice and reflection of CA and CEAS were considered through participant observation in both organisations with subsequent theological reflection. The following chapters explore the movement through the hermeneutic circle. First is the analysis of reality. CA’s acceptance of the development paradigm and globalisation is explored through its current focus: a campaign for fairer international trade.

This thesis aims to address this gap by examining how the situation of popular women activists has changed in the light of two decades of grassroots struggle. It focuses on the case of the long-established Centro de Servicios Integrados, a women's health project run by grassroots health promoters in a popular settlement in Lima, and supported by the feminist NGO, Mureres Trabajando Juntas. Drawing primarily on life histories narrated by the health promoters, this thesis focuses on the promoters' pathways to professionalisation; tensions and polarisation between the NGO and the grassroots organisation; changing leadership paradigms at the grassroots; and the interaction of local grassroots women activists in wider national and transnational networks. The thesis questions how individual health promoters have progressed socially and professionally over the 15-20 years that they have been involved in the Centro de Servicios Integrados, focusing on the extent to which, despite the 'voluntary' nature of the work, the women health promoters have become local experts. However, the research suggests that their knowledge and skills are rarely scaled up beyond the local level. Possibilities for further progress are limited by wider neoliberal processes of institutionalisation evidenced in the polarisation of the NGO-grassroots relationship, as the NGO itself has been required to professionalize and formalise its network relationships in line with good governance funding requirements. The thesis is original in several aspects - in the new ways it combines literatures on professionalisation, neoliberal managerially, transnational networks, women's grassroots organising, NGOs and development; in re-visiting popular urban women's organising in Peru, which has become seen as an exemplar of community self-help; and in its engagement with women's grassroots organising around reproductive health, which has received little attention. The thesis raises questions about the future for grassroots activists, who are left in limbo - lacking the skills required to function independently of the NGO, yet no longer fitting the NGO's wider agenda, despite the core role that representations of grassroots actors play in securing international funding. The research suggests a need to re-examine more closely the role of grassroots actors in development, with a particular emphasis on exploring the lessons to be learnt from long term social movement activists.",301647356,,Dissertations & Theses," Jenkins, K.JenkinsK.Jenkins, K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760673261 , 45063921 , 101309 , U205165 , U205165", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301647356?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy,, 0630 Public policy, Public policy," DXN094941 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Professional+health+promoters%3F%C2%A0+Re-conceptualising+urban+women%27s+organising+in+Peru.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jenkins%2C+K.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3825,Encircling the dance: social mobility through the transformation of performance in urban Senegal.,"This thesis looks at the social significance of dance in Dakar, Senegal, both as an everyday practice and as a performing art.  The boundaries commonly drawn between stage and mundane performance are shown to be irrelevant, as people circulate between performance spaces and dance forms.  The dance itself is described as an elusive way of constructing identity.  Most importantly, this thesis introduces dance as a vehicle of social mobility in its multiple dimensions, as an instrument in the politics of ethnicity, and as a site of negotiations of gender relations.  The complex interplay between the agency of local dancers and global performing circuits is also examined.  Transformations in the social status of performers are traced through time, space and across three genres of performance: the sabar , central in what I call ""women's dances"", folkloric performance and recent choreographic experiments, often misleadingly labelled ""contemporary dance"". The sabar and women's dance events are examined both as the local movement style that informs part of the choreographic work displayed on stage, and as a space in which alternative gender relations are experimented with.  I suggest that urban dance events have become increasingly dominated by women, for whom the dance is a convenient way of excluding men from their sociality.  Women are thus able to retain the control of important aspects of social life (including the socialization of young girls, marriage negotiations, exchanging secrets on how to ""tie"" a husband), engage in trade and coach each other into small-scale business.  Alongside the celebration of female solidarity, dance events are also moments of intense female competition.  This is achieved through fashion, sexually explicit dancing and elaborate manipulation of the body.  I argue that in a depressed economic climate which as turned to the disadvantage of many men, women are discreetly using their favourite form of sociality - dance events - to make advances into the socio-economic domain.",301650503,,Dissertations & Theses," Neveu Kringelbach, H.Neveu KringelbachH.Neveu Kringelbach, H.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760538161 , 45082501 , 101309 , U205847 , U205847", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301650503?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications,, 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," DN093917 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Encircling+the+dance%3A+social+mobility+through+the+transformation+of+performance+in+urban+Senegal.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Neveu+Kringelbach%2C+H.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3826,"The politics of pressure: group campaigning for and against European integration in Britain, 1997-2003","In recent decades, European integration has made significant advances such as Economic and Monetary Union and the creation of a draft Constitution.  However, public backing for the European project has diminished drastically, with several No votes in referenda on European integration issues and a rise in voter support for Eurosceptic political parties, and the EU institutions have been much-criticised for their alleged 'democratic deficit'.  This thesis considers whether campaign groups have played any part in widening or narrowing the gap between public and elite support for European integration in Britain over the period 1997-2003.  While pro-European and Eurosceptic campaign groups have emerged in several EU member states, their existence has been largely overlooked by social scientists research European integration in favour of a focus on government and political parties.  We explore these groups' significance and function by undertaking a sociological analysis of the emergence, activities and impact of groups campaigning over European integration in Britain, which addresses two questions: first, whether groups have created new spaces for political participation among citizens, and secondly, whether groups have formed new channels for communication among citizens and between citizens and political elites. The thesis tests whether theories developed in social movement research can profitably be extended to study this sector of campaign groups that act primarily within institutionalised politics, aiming to contribute to the growing body of literature examining European integration from a sociological perspective.  A multi-method approach is used, combining quantitative (social network analysis, media content analysing, frame analysis, survey data) and qualitative (semi-structured interviewing) techniques.  We examine the political opportunities that shaped group mobilisation, the national and transnational networks of alliance, opposition and influence groups established, the campaign strategies they employed and how they framed European integration.

Within these wider structural changes students do, however, exercise political agency to a varied extent. The two case studies in the thesis are based on interviews with leading student activists and archival research and focus on similar moments of political activism.  In the late 1990s both Zimbabwe and Senegal under went important 'transitions'.  In Zimbabwe it resulted in the formation of a mass party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in 1999 after a period of widespread social protests.  As the regime regained momentum after the formation of the MDC the 'transition' became increasingly frustrated.  Student activists were involved in each stage of this political ferment.  Although Senegal did not see mass mobilisation, the country experienced an important 'electoral transition'.",301651907,,Dissertations & Theses," Zeilig, Leo IsaacZeiligIsaacLeoZeilig, Leo Isaac", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

The thesis looks briefly at the history of South Asian dance in Britain, setting it in the context of funding issues, notions of tradition and innovation, and the legacy of the original Indian temple dances, the devadasis.  Elements of devadasi practice that are being reintroduced into contemporary Bharatanatyam performance to undergird religious sentiments are analysed and discussed.  These factors and both fieldwork chapters are set in a theoretical framework that considers concepts of cultural, religious and ethnic identity and the relevance of dance practices in the formation of such identities.  The presentation of data in these chapters reveals how Gujarati Raas and Garba movement forms at the Hindu religious festival of Navratri create a locus for the transmission of particular Gujarati religious and social identities, and how the teaching and performance of the classical dance form of Bharatanatyam maintains a specific Tamil identity in the Tamil temples and festivals.  Common to many diasporic milieux, the cultural practices of these two Hindu communities, in particular dance expression, are prized as carriers of ethnic and religious identity. Further chapters of the thesis examine perceptions of religiosity related to the dancing body in the light of Hindu religious worship, and within this frame, consider aspects of ritual purity and impurity and factors of gender.  The influence of Bollywood film dance on traditional dance practices is interrogated and discussed in detail in the context of global and local forces that impact significantly on diasporic communities, showing how such influences are major factors in the creation of new forms and identities, particularly for the younger generations.",301658179,,Dissertations & Theses," David, A.

As an active force in the economic development of the world, China is attractive to enterprises and producers from all over the world.  Despite the complicated political environments between China and Taiwan, the Taiwanese have been investing in China for years. The increasing TDI in China is because of Taiwan's own depressed economic, political and social conditions, as well as FDI incentives offered by the Chinese government.  Ethnical and language issues, as well as guanxi, also play important roles in this whole business process. Besides the above motives, this study also points out that an important motive for TDI in China is that Taiwanese industries are based on a 'subcontracting system', a unique international production/distribution network in East Asia, seen especially in Chinese regions.  The motives of FDI from Taiwan into China are very different from the motives of FDI based on oligopolistic enterprises. TDI in China tends to involve an entire Taiwanese 'industrial migration', instead of the movement of firms due to the Taiwanese subcontracting system. This thesis aims to contribute to the study of FDI on Taiwanese firms which have mainland based ventures.  This thesis attempts to provide an overall picture of TDI in China by exploring the investment motives, industries, and locations over a set time span. This thesis examines the determinants of Locational choices on TDI in China based on a conditional logit model. Similar to Hou and Zhang's study (2001), my empirical results find that there is strong evidence of structural change on the determinants of Locational choices of TDI in China over time, especially for infrastructure and labour costs.  The factors behind this structural change include China's WTO entry and cultural links supported by the FDI policy. The results also show that the technology transfer from TDI into China has been significant for my sample period.",301673157,,Dissertations & Theses," Ling, J-J.LingJ-J.Ling, J-J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760892671 , 45099731 , 101309 , U222410 , U222410", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301673157?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," DXN101602 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+investment+behaviour+of+Taiwanese+in+mainland+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ling%2C+J-J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3831,A radical institutional analysis of the economic theory and empirical reality of the British national minimum wage.,"This thesis provides a three-fold integrated analysis of the minimum wage by examining: the philosophical underpinnings of minimum wage economic theory, the empirical reality of the minimum wage and the economic policy of the minimum wage.  An integrated and holistic analysis of the minimum wage is needed because the minimum wage is portrayed as a narrow policy measure affecting just a small segment of the labour market; predominantly low skilled/young/vulnerable workers.  The wider philosophical and theoretical questions surrounding the minimum wage have been left largely unexamined, as they are deemed to be outwith the parameters of orthodox economic theory. Instead of being viewed as a marginal policy for marginalised workers this thesis argues that the minimum wage is instrumental to the functioning of the entire labour market and the wage determination of all workers.  The minimum wage has the potential to be a key instrument for radical institutional transformation.  However, this can only be achieved through the development and application of an alternative economic framework of analysis for the minimum wage. This thesis delivers an alternative and integrated analysis by the:   Application of a new analytical framework - radical institutionalism - to examine the minimum wage .  By applying a radical institutionalist framework, for the first time, to the minimum wage the scope of analysis has been broadened out to overcome the methodological impasse dictated by neo-classical economic theory and allows an integrated and contextualised examination of the social, political and economic issues pertinent to the minimum wage.   Primary data - 'Scoping' interviews with stakeholders, along with the literature review, developed the conceptual model for this thesis.  Focus group primary research was conducted with young labour market participants; with the questions, then content analysed, within the radical institutional analytical framework to construct appropriate primary knowledge about the minimum wage.  This approach highlighted to key theoretical constructs of process, power, exploitation and alienation and their role in labour market analysis.  Key policy constructs also emerged, including cumulative causation, The System and socialised choice. This thesis finds that the empirical reality of the British national minimum wage is that it has had minimal impact.  Historical and international contextual analysis demonstrates that the minimum wage could contributed to the institutionalisation of low pay without an effective and independent uprating mechanism.  International analysis also highlights the power of local governance and the potential that the living wage movement has for developing the British national minimum wage.",301688067,,Dissertations & Theses," McSorley, L.McSorleyL.McSorley, L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760536181 , 45082031 , 101309 , U199044 , U199044", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301688067?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," DX231029 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+radical+institutional+analysis+of+the+economic+theory+and+empirical+reality+of+the+British+national+minimum+wage.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McSorley%2C+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3832,Re-ordering Hong Kong: decolonisation and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights ordinance.,"The Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (HKBORO) denotes a change in British decolonisation policy from that which prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s, where the Bill of Rights provisions in the new Commonwealth countries entailed the protection of minorities, often as a defence for the economic interests of European settlers and descendents.  The HKBORO is unique because, first, the decision to incorporate it into Hong Kong law was political, and aimed at restoring the confidence of the Hong Kong people following the suppression of the Tiananmen democratic movement in Beijing in 1989.  Secondly, Hong Kong was the only British colony to incorporate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to entrench it (albeit indirectly) in a constitutional document -- in the case of Hong Kong, the Letters Patent, the constitution for Hong Kong before 1997.  This incorporation and entrenchment was aimed at putting Hong Kong under the protection of international human rights norms and, it was hoped, to ensure that the HKBORO continued in force under the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the ""constitution"" that was to apply when sovereignty over Hong Kong reverted to the People's Republic of China (PRC) after 1997. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the dissertation.  Chapters 2 and 3 examine human rights development in Hong Kong before 1989.  Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the drafting of the HKBORO before its enactment on 8 June 199L Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the relevant case law and human rights legislation that emerged before 1997.  Chapter 8 concludes the dessertation by arguing that, although the PRC opposed an entrenched HKBORO -- with this negative attitude resulting in the repeal of the ""entrenchment"" provisions in the HKBORO -- the experience of the HKBORO shows that in the Hong Kong case, a Bill of Rights was introduced essentially as a mean to establish public confidence, which was necessary at time of major social and political change, in particular, the planned transfer of sovereignty.  This conclusion provides a new dimension to our understanding of the role of the Bill of Rights in the decolonisation process.",301694077,,Dissertations & Theses," Wong, W.L.M.WongW.L.M.Wong, W.L.M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760621271 , 45058151 , 101309 , U209672 , U209672", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301694077?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," DXN093659 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re-ordering+Hong+Kong%3A+decolonisation+and+the+Hong+Kong+Bill+of+Rights+ordinance.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wong%2C+W.L.M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3833,The past and the present in migration discourse: aliens and nationals in Greece.,"In contemporary studies, international migration is conceived either as a negative movement, a ""security threat"", that endangers internal order and provokes nationalist and xenophobic reactions, or as a positive movement of ""migrancy"" that creates the necessary conditions for the transcendence of oppressive cultural and territorial boundaries and the creation of the limit separating nationals from aliens that makes possible both negative and positive conceptions of migration. It documents how this limit had to be continuously re-drawn in different eras, sometimes to include and sometimes to exclude migrants, in order to sustain the unity and homogeneity of an always incomplete national identity. The thesis focuses on the Greek discourse of migration, understood in terms of a paradox of past/present, immigration/emigration that reveals the fluidity of the territorial and cultural limits of the nation. Based on Michel Foucault's ""early"" works, it traces the emergence of this paradox in four distinct objects of knowledge (Greek refugees and emigrants, foreign refugees and immigrants) that materialise in dispersed social sites, antagonistic subject positions and discontinuous historical settings. The analysis results into a complex mapping echoing diverse and often conflicting strategies and practices ranging from overtly xenophobic and racist reactions towards aliens to hospitality and the nationalist idealisation of migrant experiences. The thesis ultimately endorses the political paradox of migration in opposition to those analyses that conceive the limit separating nationals from aliens in essentialist terms: it argues that there is neither a centralised space of absolute exclusion, where the immigrant ""Other"" is located, nor a permanent location where a unitary national identity can exist.",301694103,,Dissertations & Theses," Kambouri, H.KambouriH.Kambouri, H.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760455521 , 45063421 , 101309 , U194847 , U194847", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301694103?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," DXN085355 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+past+and+the+present+in+migration+discourse%3A+aliens+and+nationals+in+Greece.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kambouri%2C+H.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3834,Revolution and pachakuti: political and indigenous cinema in bolivia and colombia,"This thesis focuses on cinema and video made by and about indigenous or subaltern people and communities in Bolivia and Colombia, and discusses the interaction between different cultural notions of social change and of aesthetic representation. It centres on the productions of Jorge Sanjines' Bolivian Ukamau Group, and of Marta Rodriguez's Fundaci6n Cine Documental in Colombia. Previous studies of these filmmaking collectives have tended to view them under the banner of either national cinematic traditions; the artistic and political avant-garde often termed as the 'New Latin American Cinema'; or a longer history of indigenous film and media. This thesis is bound by none of these categories, but asks how they overlap, mutually inform and alter one another. By combining close textual analysis with wider contextual and historical accounts of the films' production and distribution, it examines the linkages between aesthetic form, cultural memory and political action. It thus begins with an account of the national and international circulation of militant avant-garde indigenista and revolutionary cinema in the 1960s and 1970s, showing how these groups inserted their work into existing and nascent political and cultural movements, infrastructures and networks. It discusses how the film collectives' early works converted existing national tropes of the primitive into potential subjects of continental revolution. It argues that methodological and textual innovations have increasingly opened films up to the cultural and political expressions of their participants, and converted them into fields of intercultural dialogue and debate. It proposes that even videos made by indigenous people themselves are inevitably mediated by aesthetic, technological and institutional structures, and considers some of the strategies that indigenous intellectuals and video-makers have employed in response. This thesis concludes that the most effective political cinemas have been those that have acknowledged and gained strength from their own status as mediations between different political, cultural and ideological spheres; between European-derived notions of social change (revolution) and Andean ones (pachakuti).",301694943,,Dissertations & Theses," Wood, David Michael JohnWoodMichael JohnDavidWood, David Michael John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760674381 , 45108121 , 101309 , U209045 , U209045 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/revolution-and-pachakuti--political-and-indigenous-cinema-in-bolivia-and-colombia(37111910-1bbe-4177-87e3-53ec4930e53f).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301694943?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/revolution-and-pachakuti--political-and-indigenous-cinema-in-bolivia-and-colombia(37111910-1bbe-4177-87e3-53ec4930e53f).html , DXN095548 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revolution+and+pachakuti%3A+political+and+indigenous+cinema+in+bolivia+and+colombia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wood%2C+David+Michael+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3835,Rape and human rights: a feminist perspective,"Echoing the ambivalent relationship feminism has historically had with law, feminists working within the violence against women movement within England and Wales have shown little enthusiasm for a statutory Bill of Rights.  Neither the European Convention on Human Rights nor the Human Rights Act 1998 has been the focus of feminist research or activism in this area.  Indeed, the social sciences as a whole have been slow to engage with international human rights law and theorise any impact on law and policy. This thesis develops an analytical and conceptual framework in which to investigate the use, outcomes and policy impact of human rights arguments made by rape victims and defendants under the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.  Documentary analysis of 31 law reports using this framework showed that rape defendants used human rights more often than rape victims did, but that rape victims were more likely to win their case. It is concluded that the European Convention on Human Rights has contributed to the development of some new pan-European standards in rape cases, despite the fact that few cases were taken by rape victims.  There is a good understanding at the European Court of the impact rape has on its victims and also of the difficulties that exist in proving rape.  Some suggestions for the future are offered, including the need for: clarity of procedures and funding for third party interventions; equal representation in the judiciary; feminists to think 'horizontally'; knowledge from and joint working with human rights experts.  The time and space that human rights provide can provide an ideal opportunity to challenge existing criminal justice discourses around rape, victims and defendants.",301717701,,Dissertations & Theses," Westmarland, Marie NicoleWestmarlandNicoleMarieWestmarland, Marie Nicole", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760621051 , 45097931 , 101309 , U213519 , U213519 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10977/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301717701?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10977/ , DXN098908 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rape+and+human+rights%3A+a+feminist+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westmarland%2C+Marie+Nicole&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3836,"Toward a textual promised land: Youth culture, race and identity on the Internet","This dissertation is a 3-study exploration of the construction of race in online sites for children and adolescents. More specifically, the 3 studies examine racial and ethnic identity and intergroup relations among youth on the Internet. The first study is a comparison of racial and ethnic discourse in monitored vs. unmonitored teen chat rooms. Contrary to the claims of Internet scholars, race and ethnicity were frequently mentioned in teen chat: 37 out of 38 half-hour transcripts had at least one racial or ethnic utterance. While most references had a neutral or positive valence in both monitored and unmonitored chat rooms, chat participants, nonetheless had a 19% chance of being exposed to negative remarks about a racial or ethnic group in monitored chat and a 59% chance in unmonitored chat. These findings suggest that, in the absence of social controls, such as a monitor, what may be latent negative intergroup attitudes can surface. The second study explores the involvement of children and adolescents in racist and anti-Semitic hate speech online. A range of online spaces—websites, chat rooms and discussion boards—along with extant literature on adults were used to describe the global environment of online hate. The computer tools used to disseminate hate materials as well as the discourse strategies used to recruit, socialize, and persuade others within the online hate movement and derogate targets outside were included are also delineated. Finally, the third study examines intergroup contact, ethnic identity and outgroup orientation. Eighty-three teens were administered the ethnic identity and outgroup orientation subscales of the Multi-ethnic identity measure (MEIM) and interviewed online. Contrary to what is commonly found in ethnic identity literature, this study found no significant differences between white participants' scores on the MEIM and those of ethnic minorities. Expected positive correlations between time spent online interacting with ethnic groups other than one's own and ethnic identity were found only with minority participants. Time interacting with other ethnic groups was positively correlated with outgroup orientation for whites and negatively correlated for minorities (although the sample size of minority participants was too small for the latter correlation to reach statistical significance).",305002763,,Dissertations & Theses," Tynes, Brendesha MarieTynesMarieBrendeshaTynes, Brendesha Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 954031471 , 27479501 , 66569 , 9780542222184 , 0542222183 , 3181762 , 3181762", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542222184 , 0542222183", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305002763?accountid=14496," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0708 Mass media"," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0708 Mass media"," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0708 Mass media",," 0620 Developmental psychology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0708 Mass media"," Developmental psychology , Educational psychology , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Education , Psychology , Identity , Internet , Race , Youth culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toward+a+textual+promised+land%3A+Youth+culture%2C+race+and+identity+on+the+Internet&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tynes%2C+Brendesha+Marie&amp;isbn=9780542222184&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3837,Analysis of physical and social economic factors in maize production decision -making in Tanzania,"Maize is the major staple food of Tanzania; in urban centers it is the staple food for more than 90% of the population. The maize production process has a far reaching impact for the well being of the country. The fate of the country generally is determined by the urban dwellers as they are relatively educated and have economic and political clout. The first objective of the research was to access the impact of marketing, physical and social-economic factors on maize production in Iringa district, Tanzania. Problems that hinder free maize marketing were identified for follow-up action to improve performance. Physical and social-economical factors influencing maize production were assessed. These factors included: available resources, distance from household to the farms, topography, soil types, family size and organization, education levels of family members, available land and farm sizes, crop diversity, intensification and commercialization. Using these factors, two maize production regression models are developed. The second objective of the research was to test the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer. We compared predicted maize yields with observed results. DSSAT seems to overestimate the yields. Basing on the science of the model and the input data, we assumed that the model showed a very reliable ‘production potential’ of the three villages. Field data collection included physical measurements using Global Positioning Systems, soil sampling, and formal survey questionnaires in conjunction with informal interviews with the farmers and traders. The results show that the difference in crop production between farmers using manure and those who do not is markedly huge. About 60% farm-generated income is accrued from maize in all three villages. On average female-headed families earn about 49.49% of the male-headed families. The bigger the farmed area, gives the farmer more flexibility in having diversity in crops. With more diversity in crops, financial dependency on the maize crop by the farmer is reduced. Tanzania needs to improve the communication infrastructure, review trade policies and regulations on cross-country movement and cross-border trade of maize so as to enhance the volume of maize trade. Farmers should be encourage to form and participate in savings and credit associations.",305003467,,Dissertations & Theses," Rwiza, Katetegeilwe M.RwizaM.KatetegeilweRwiza, Katetegeilwe M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 982789621 , 27199601 , 66569 , 9780542270055 , 0542270056 , 3185568 , 3185568", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542270055 , 0542270056", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305003467?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Decision-making , Maize production , Physical economic , Social economic , Tanzania",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analysis+of+physical+and+social+economic+factors+in+maize+production+decision+-making+in+Tanzania&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rwiza%2C+Katetegeilwe+M.&amp;isbn=9780542270055&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3838,Revolutionary ambience and historical memory: Popular Front poetic radicalism at the California-world border,"The history and literary achievements of the Popular Front movements (1934-1939) in the United States that emerged in response to the Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe are typically framed with the United States Communist Party in New York as the center. To broaden our understanding of the political and creative variety within the Popular Front, this dissertation focuses on the poets and poetry of California. It is a historical study that combines archival and secondary research on a selection of writers and their milieux with close readings of representative poems. By examining these California left poets' relationship to an emerging cultural pluralist regionalist movement, this dissertation identifies a common thread in their development of a poetic-political worldview that sought to redefine ""America"" in relation to global populations within and outside its borders. This ambient worldview was based on the dream of a deep social ecology in which global connections were more defining than borders. The first chapter takes poet Kenneth Rexroth as a guide to understanding the era and the role of the poet in the discursive battle for historical memory. The second chapter looks at the theoretical relationship between region, nation, and world in Muriel Rukeyser's poetry and the specific role of California in her revolutionary imaginary. The third chapter provides the historical context by delineating the different strands of nationalism, regionalism, and internationalism circulating at this time and how they intersected for the poets and writers organizing the Western Writers Congress in 1935. The fourth chapter examines the life, poetry, and worldview of California poets Sara Bard Field, Hildegarde Flanner, and Marie de Laveaga Welch for their struggle to create their own political positions appropriate to the times. The final chapter looks at the poetic and political activism of Carlos Bulosan and Marie de Laveaga Welch and their regionally focused historicizing. By examining the variety and details of the lives and poetry of the California Popular Front, we gain a deeper understanding of the history and the possible futures of the United States Left.",305004035,,Dissertations & Theses," Bird, Kimberly E.BirdE.KimberlyBird, Kimberly E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1027491071 , 17944881 , 66569 , 9780542384288 , 0542384280 , 3194051 , 3194051", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542384288 , 0542384280", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305004035?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies",," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," American literature , American history , American studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , California , Historical memory , Poetic radicalism , Popular front , Revolutionary",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revolutionary+ambience+and+historical+memory%3A++Popular+Front+poetic+radicalism+at+the+California-world+border&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bird%2C+Kimberly+E.&amp;isbn=9780542384288&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3839,"Building opportunities: Women's organizing, militarism and the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor","This dissertation documents the consequences for women's activism when the United Nations acted as government in East Timor between October 1999 and May 2002. After 25 years of Indonesian rule, the East Timorese voted overwhelmingly to become an independent State on 30 August 1999. In the postelectoral violence fuelled by militias and the Indonesian military, 3000 people were killed, most of the population was displaced, and East Timor was left without water, electricity or a functioning government. On 25 October 1999, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1272 mandated the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to oversee rehabilitation, humanitarian relief and the building of governance institutions. This study explores how political opportunities for women's activism were shaped by a masculinized, militarized government. It documents which activism around women' issues were successful in drawing UNTAET's support, and conversely, which were not. Using the interdisciplinary field of women's studies, and drawing on theoretical frameworks as diverse as feminist history, social movement theory, feminist international relations and post-conflict studies, the dissertation is located within the emerging field of feminist critiques of United Nations administrations. The study is based on over 20 interviews with members of East Timorese women's organizations and personnel from UNTAET, participant observation, and written documents. UNTAET drew its power and resources from the highest military echelons within the United Nations. In this context, the ensuing planning and execution of the civilian administrative functions of UNTAET were both militarized and masculinized, that is, they created an environment in which the power of the masculine and the military were consolidated. Drawing on these resources and methodology, it is possible to conclude that UNTAET supported women's activism only when it did not threaten or challenge the power or resources of militarized and masculinized elite within the administration.",305007392,,Dissertations & Theses," Joshi, VijayaJoshiVijayaJoshi, Vijaya", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 885689091 , 17942311 , 66569 , 9780496973798 , 0496973797 , 3163358 , 3163358", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780496973798 , 0496973797", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305007392?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , East Timor , Indonesia , Militarism , Transitional administration , United Nations , Women's organizing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+opportunities%3A+Women%27s+organizing%2C+militarism+and+the+United+Nations+transitional+administration+in+East+Timor&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Joshi%2C+Vijaya&amp;isbn=9780496973798&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3840,"Beyond relief and rehabilitation: The role of NGOs in Kenya's development, 1924–2000","This dissertation interrogates the role of three international Non-governmental organizations (INGOs)---the Rockefeller Foundation, CARE International and Oxfam in Kenya's development process between 1924 and 2000. Based on secondary and primary research conducted in the United States and Kenya between 2002 and 2004, the dissertation historicizes INGOs in their tripartite paradoxical roles as agents of colonialism, globalization and development. It traces the role of these NGOs in Kenya's development in their various ways of 'performing development', assessing the various obstacles and successes they have encountered in the process. It explores development relationships in oppositional binaries, between NGO development workers and the project beneficiaries, between NGOs and civil servants, and the ensuing tensions in local structures and institutions. It investigates how these NGOs strive to 'indigenize' their work developmentally in order to foster 'sustainable development' and how local dynamics and environments influence them, and vise versa. The dissertation deconstructs the long-held myths about NGO inviolability, and opens ground for genuine dialogue and discourse on their strengths and weaknesses in Kenya. It interrogates sites of contestation, areas and spaces of negotiation, anxieties and possibilities that NGOs have created in the history of development in Kenya. It looks at structures of hegemony, power, class and gender that NGOs have created through their projects. It illustrates the extent to which these NGOs are instrumental in the spreading of capitalism, especially economic, cultural and social violence through globalization in Kenya. Thus, the dissertation seeks to explain five patterns: (1) NGOs are part and parcel of Kenya's colonial development legacy, which includes the perpetuation of dependency development; (2) NGOs have provided an alternative reservoir of development resources in Kenya without which some areas would probably never have developed; (3) because of their association with grassroots and civil society movements, NGOs have created spaces of articulation and engagement for the marginalized such as the disabled, the youth, women and children; (4) by fraternizing with the popular masses and sponsoring political elites, NGOs have earned themselves the legitimacy to facilitate and arbitrate local development; (5) because of their patronizing manner and hegemony, they are agents of globalization.",305017487,,Dissertations & Theses," Amutabi, Maurice NyamangaAmutabiNyamangaMauriceAmutabi, Maurice Nyamanga", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1051244321 , 32330621 , 66569 , 0542445468 , 9780542445460 , 3198919 , 3198919", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 0542445468 , 9780542445460", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305017487?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," 0331 African history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," 0331 African history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science",," 0331 African history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," African history , Cultural anthropology , Political science"," Social sciences , Kenya , Nongovernmental organizations , Nonprofit organizations , Rehabilitation , Relief , Third sector , Voluntary sector",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+relief+and+rehabilitation%3A+The+role+of+NGOs+in+Kenya%27s%0Adevelopment%2C+1924%E2%80%932000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Amutabi%2C+Maurice+Nyamanga&amp;isbn=0542445468&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3841,"&lt;i&gt;Guarango como guitarra en tango&lt;/i&gt; [awkward as a guitar in the tango]: The rise, fall, and rebirth of the guitar in the Argentinean tango","The Spanish guitar, Argentina's national instrument, has a long history in its adopted homeland with roots in the Spanish conquest of the Río de la Plata (1516–1580). Included in this history is the role of the guitar in the tango. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the guitar was a part of the gaucho image that symbolized Argentinidad [Argentineness], but the simple chords and habanera rhythms with which guitarists accompanied the first tangos were rapidly replaced by the more dynamic piano as the tango achieved success abroad. The tango moved first from the arrabales [slums] and bordellos to polite society of Paris, back to Buenos Aires, and finally to the rest of the “civilized” world. Not until the Nuevo Tango movement of the 1950s, influenced both by classical music and popular music styles of jazz, samba, and bossa nova, did la guitarra tanguera [the tango guitar] regain and even surpass its earlier prominence. The passionate tango has drawn worldwide attention recently via Broadway shows, feature films such as Carlos Saura's Tango (1998) and Robert Duvall's Assassination Tango (2002), social dancing, and commercial recordings. Argentinean composer Astor Piazzolla (1921–1992), for whom the tango was always “more for the ear rather than the feet,” finally achieved international success only in his last years with his Nuevo Tango. However, within the world of the classical guitar—as well as in Western art music at large—very little is documented regarding history and performance practice of this urban-folk music style that has attained a place in the Western art tradition. The maturation of the guitar in the Argentinean tango parallels the increasing interest in the tango as something “more for the ears than for the feet.” Using Argentinean poet and historian Horacio Ferrer's classification of the epochs of the tango as a basis, I will detail the phenomenon of the guitar in the tango with regard to its history and specific performance practices from the earliest strums at the turn of the twentieth century to the most recent touches upon the strings, one hundred years later.",305026203,,Dissertations & Theses," Dorsey, ChristopherDorseyChristopherDorsey, Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 885697961 , 18157561 , 66569 , 9780542013362 , 0542013363 , 3166086 , 3166086", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542013362 , 0542013363", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305026203?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0336 Latin American history"," 0413 Music , 0336 Latin American history"," 0413 Music , 0336 Latin American history",," 0413 Music , 0336 Latin American history"," Music , Latin American history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Argentinean , Astor Piazzolla , Guitar , Piazzolla, Astor , Tango",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Guarango+como+guitarra+en+tango+%3A+The+rise%2C+fall%2C+and+rebirth+of+the+guitar+in+the+Argentinean+tango&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dorsey%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9780542013362&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3842,Nationalism and cultural influences in the bassoon music of Latin America in the twentieth century,"This paper examines bassoon music written by Latin American composers of the twentieth century, relative to identified cultural influences. Through the processes of acculturation and transculturation, the multi-cultural climate of Latin America has produced a broad and diverse palette of music. The unique cultural diversity of the various regions, combined with efforts to create national musics, have also shaped the resultant music. Many Latin American composers wrote for the bassoon in the twentieth century. Francisco Mignone (1897–1986), Mario Lavista (b. 1943), and José Luis Campana (b. 1949) have been chosen as representative composers whose works reflect many of the issues discussed in the paper. Mignone's prolific output and enduring contribution provide an opportunity to consider a great variety of music produced as a result of changing social and cultural influences. Both Lavista and Campana belong to the generation of composers after Mignone, and thus came of age when the drive for nationalistic expression was waning. However, they incorporated the cultural influences they experienced in their lives in different ways. After the three main case studies, another group of representative works by Salvador Ranieri (b. 1930), Mario Ficarelli (b. 1930), Jorge Mockert (b. 1958), Brenno Blauth (1931–1993), Guillermo Bernstein Seixas (b.1968), and Ramón Montes de Oca (b. 1953) are briefly addressed. These works by Latin American composers also demonstrate various types of cultural influences discussed herein. Within this body of works, there is evidence of influence by indigenous cultures, popular music, and even abstract international movements.",305026623,,Dissertations & Theses," Stevens, Gina L.StevensL.GinaStevens, Gina L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 888833581 , 18157561 , 66569 , 9780542021473 , 0542021471 , 3166942 , 3166942", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542021473 , 0542021471", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305026623?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history"," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history"," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history",," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history"," Music , Cultural anthropology , Latin American history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Bassoon , Cultural influences , Latin America , Nationalism , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nationalism+and+cultural+influences+in+the+bassoon+music+of+Latin+America+in+the+twentieth+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stevens%2C+Gina+L.&amp;isbn=9780542021473&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3843,"Always a struggle: Mexican Americans in Miami, Arizona, 1909–1951","""Always a Struggle: Mexican Americans in Miami, Arizona, 1909-1951"" examines the Mexicano and Mexican American experience in a copper mining town located approximately ninety miles east of metropolitan Phoenix. Scholars have not examined this group's history in Miami, Arizona; this is the first study. Primary and secondary sources, as well as numerous oral history interviews, provide the evidence that supports the thesis that Mexicanos and Mexican Americans have always struggled to claim their rights as Americans in their copper town. Despite the racism, segregation and the discrimination they encountered from Euro-Americans in building their lives, Mexican Americans persevered and fought back to claim their rights as Americans and attained the American dream of success and education. In reconstructing this history, several themes emerge: ethnic relations; social, religious, and school segregation; the Great Depression and the repatriation movement; the rise of unionism and the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers' (IUMMSW) efforts to seek wage equality for its members; the leadership of working class Mexican Americans in the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Chapter #111; the Mexicano and Mexican Americans' alliance with African Americans to prevent the destruction and removal of their homes for the sake of development and tourist dollars; and, the rise of the third generation of Mexican Americans through education and sports. In Miami, Arizona, basketball became a symbol of the American dream of equality.

Culturally specific anxieties about movement and displacement, sexual normativity, spatial confinements, and language censorship, condition diverse narratives from South Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Africa and motivate collective insurgencies against the postcolonial nation within these texts. Nationalist controls over place, people, speech, sexuality, and labor become severely codified as postcolonial states are integrated outward to the imperial metropolitan economies of the west, and their own economies are internally disarticulated. This dissertation proposes that postcolonial novels map the contested sites of modernity and a recalcitrance to its norms as ethical and collective struggles against forces of transnationalism. As well, these novels stage strategic interruptions in the ways in which postcolonial cultural formations are routinely interpellated and managed for exploitation within the modern world system. In this sense, these literatures represent ways in which postcolonial cultural formations counter-manage the terms of modernity (marked by uneven distribution, flexible accumulation, commodification and exploitation) by partially entering into its protocols. My analysis shows that the framing of modernity within certain postcolonial texts draws on culturally coded social, political and historical registers to articulate ways in which subaltern collectives in postcolonial societies remain intractable to the west's logic of commodification. In a comparative manner the dissertation's four chapters on Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children , George Lamming's In the Castle of My Skin and Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy , Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart , and Ahdaf Soueif s In the Eye of the Sun accentuate the particular historical and cultural confluences that shape approaches to sexual, racial, and class mobilization for these authors. I contend that what is urgently contested within postcolonial Anglophone literatures, and what allows us to read these literatures as counter-canons to dominant literary traditions, are the troubled turns to modernity upon which claims of both exploitation and collective agency are predicated. In addition to literary works, this thesis also draws broadly from archival, political, critical, legal, film and historical sources in weaving a complex and situated understanding of modernity as new Empire expansionism and the various resistances to it.",305031936,,Dissertations & Theses," Chakravorty, MrinaliniChakravortyMrinaliniChakravorty, Mrinalini", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 982818581 , 27208421 , 66569 , 9780542269387 , 0542269384 , 3185480 , 3185480", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542269387 , 0542269384", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305031936?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0316 African literature"," 0298 Literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0316 African literature"," 0298 Literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0316 African literature",," 0298 Literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0316 African literature"," Literature , Asian literature , Caribbean literature , African literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Achebe, Chinua , Ahdaf Soueif , Anglophone , Antigua , Barbados , Chinua Achebe , Collectives , Egypt , George Lamming , India , Jamaica Kincaid , Kincaid, Jamaica , Lamming, George , Modernities , Nigeria , Postcolonial , Rushdie, Salman , Salman Rushdie , Soueif, Ahdaf",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Managing+modernities%3A+Postcolonial+collectives+in+twentieth-century+Anglophone+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chakravorty%2C+Mrinalini&amp;isbn=9780542269387&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3845,"Democratic communists: Party and class in South Africa and Kerala, India","This dissertation compares the contrasting efforts of the Communist Parties in South Africa and Kerala, India to translate their novel visions of socialist democracy into practice. Two general stories are told. One is a story of the remarkable ideological convergence around a shared vision of socialist democracy articulated by the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). The second story is of the divergence in the CPI(M)'s and SACP's efforts to implement their visions into practice. In trying to account for their divergence, I have argued that the CPI(M)'s counter-hegemonic and SACP's hegemonic politics are integrally linked to the organizational capacities and histories of each Party and the political and economic conditions prevailing at the time. While both Parties have understood socialist democracy in a broadly similar manner in which pluralistic, participatory democracy is placed at the center, they have tended to emphasize different politics and practices in their efforts to realize this vision. In particular, the SACP has tended to enlist hegemonic politics and mass mobilizing where the emphasis is on mass actions and high profile events, while the CPI(M) has given much emphasis to counter-hegemonic politics and participatory organizing, which highlights local-level capacity building and empowerment. The dissertation explores the conditions under which the SACP and CPI(M) worked to translate their transformative aspirations into practice and explain why they diverged. In chapter 1 I discuss the relevance of the project to the discipline of sociology. There are three bodies of scholarship I address in the study: literature specifically on communism, literature focusing on political parties, and scholarship on social movements. In chapter 2, I examine the international and national challenges that led the SACP and CPI(M) to arrive at similar visions of socialist democracy around five themes: a deepened and extended notion of democracy, a new developmental state, the coexistence of socialism and capitalism, a role for regulated markets, and no blueprint of socialism. After having arrived at similar visions of socialist democracy, in Part I (chapters 3 and 4) I show that the CPI(M) and SACP diverged in their efforts to translate these aspirations into practices, which I argue is related to the balance of power among competing tendencies within the Parties. In Part II (chapters 5, 6 and 7) I look into the conditions that explain the divergence in their practices. In chapter 5 and 6 I explore the necessary, though not sufficient, conditions of organizational capacities and Party histories and argue that while both history and capacity matter these factors alone do not explain the divergent trajectories of the CPI(M) and SACP. In chapter 7 I argue that the political practices are integrally linked to the way in which organizational capacities and histories interact with political and economic conditions.",305032128,,Dissertations & Theses," Williams, Michelle AnnetteWilliamsAnnetteMichelleWilliams, Michelle Annette", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 982792551 , 17945731 , 66569 , 9780542291654 , 0542291657 , 3187185 , 3187185", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542291654 , 0542291657", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305032128?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Democratic communists , India , Kerala , Party , Social movements , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Democratic+communists%3A+Party+and+class+in+South+Africa+and+Kerala%2C+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Michelle+Annette&amp;isbn=9780542291654&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3846,Constructing the invisible landscape: Organizing the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles,"The summer Olympic Games of 1932 is not an architectural story in the narrow sense of the term. If 'architecture' is broadly defined as landscape and the process by which it is shaped, invested with meaning, and packaged, then the organizing effort is a very architectural story indeed. Boosters brought the Games to Los Angeles as a surrogate world's fair. The Organizing Committee---that select group of boosters enthusiastically supported by local publishers---sought the opportunity to host the Olympics for the purpose of promoting the city. They endeavored to manipulate the landscape as a means of making the Olympics a showcase, but 'manipulate' here means not so much the building and rebuilding of material form, constructing streets and buildings, it also means the construction of experience by a variety of material and ephemeral means. Even before the athletes arrived, the booster's project was the creation and projection of a holistic image of landscape---they called it arcadia---a landscape without internal contradictions and organically suited to the ideals of Olympism and the mythic ideals boosters had recanted for fifty years. They accomplished this largely by suppressing, or making invisible, aspects of the landscape and attendant social relations that contradicted the booster's narrative. This dissertation treats the Olympic event as a synthesis of motives and strategies, an urban episode in which local boosters inflected and re-interpreted the Olympic scheme. Although the Olympic movement has been imagined by scholars as an autonomous movement, the International Olympic Committee (I.O.C.) had no alternative but to share control with local organizers. A variety of people capitalized upon the spectacle for ulterior motives: advertisers promoted products and services while reformers used the Olympics to assert their ideas about family and women. As the rise of unemployment during the Great Depression prompted a retrenchment against women in the workplace, sports were conceived as an analogous setting in which women also belonged on the sidelines. Newspaper reports, a wide array of official and private correspondence, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce's meeting minutes and reports, and an extensive collection of visual documents---photographs, political cartoons and caricatures, newsreels and brochures, as well as urban plans and a few architectural drawings---comprise this story's source material. The analysis of these sources involves moving between the architectural scene and the scales of city and region, to analyze the less visible structures that make possible the construction of modern cities.

The uniqueness is a synergetic result of organizing artists' workshops and supporting interactivity to creating a protean barrio institution, which served as a catalyst for visual arts in an economically under-resourced urban area. It is clear that the founder of Self Help, Sister Karen Boccalero (1933-1997), who was also the Executive Director, and her collaborators and associates put an indelible stamp on this cultural institution. The center engaged in promoting education about and pride in Mexican and Chicana/o culture. Through the ateliers, youth programs, and annual Day of the Dead celebration, Self Help reflected and recreated many facets of Chicana/o aesthetics and the struggle for social justice. The history of this organization and the artists who became a part of it is investigated using oral histories, archival papers, local newspapers, and the artwork itself. Self Help Graphics became the premier center for serigraphy in Los Angeles and one of the most well known and respected Chicana/o art centers in the United States. Over the past three decades, dozens of prominent artists began their careers there. Self Help Graphics provided dozens of artists with opportunities to hone their technical skills and the chance to exhibit and sell their work, whereas many mainstream art galleries and museums had denied them this opportunity. The role that Self Help Graphics plays in Los Angeles's cultural and artistic life is a stellar model for how art institutions should approach a city of such stunning diversity. For decades now, the definition of Chicana/o art has been changing, taking on a diverse group of artists as allies and collaborators---Latina/o immigrants, Blacks, Asians, Queers---and topics and aesthetic styles. The cultural formations that reflect transnational aesthetics, popular/street culture, disjuncture, dissonance, and synthesis demand that we re-assess our own notions of the Chicano art movement.",305033521,,Dissertations & Theses," Guzman, KristenGuzmanKristenGuzman, Kristen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1075683471 , 18215221 , 66569 , 9780542508875 , 0542508877 , 3202786 , 3202786", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542508875 , 0542508877", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305033521?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0377 Art history , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0377 Art history , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0377 Art history , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0337 American history , 0377 Art history , 0323 American studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American history , Art history , American studies , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , California , Chicano/a , Cultural centers , Los Angeles , Self Help Graphics and Art, Inc.",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Art+in+the+heart+of+East+L.A.%3A++A+history+of+Self+Help+Graphics+and+Art%2C+Inc.%2C+1972%E2%80%932004&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Guzman%2C+Kristen&amp;isbn=9780542508875&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3848,Cultural localization and transnational flows: Music in the Magindanaon communities of the Philippines,"Music was the site through which I explored the social, cultural, and expressive life of a Muslim minority group in the Philippines, the Magindanao. Their diverse musical genres served as loci through which I examined how local and global influences play a role in shaping Magindanaon cultural production and musical praxis. These five common but distinct musical genres are kulintang (gong-drum) music, dayunday (songduel) performances, ""Moro"" songs about the separatist rebellion, unaccompanied folksongs, and Indonesian Islamic-themed karaoke videos ( qasidah and sholawat ). Influences in each genre I investigated flow through metropoles, between margins, with and without the movement of people, and through the exchange of commercially available media. Muslim Filipinos, including the Magindanao, are commonly regarded as more ""traditional"" than the larger Christian Filipino population, that is, they are believed to resist modern cultural influences, especially from the West. Contrary to this, I found that many genres of Magindanaon music reveal a variety of influences including American folksongs and rock, Indonesian karaoke, Arabic music, and Filipino popular music. I traced some of these diverse influences from their homeland in Mindanao, in migrant communities in Manila, and by way of overseas contract workers from the Middle East. Their music has also inspired cultural performances by Filipino Americans in the United States. The transformative processes of localization and innovation are most evident in Magindanaon musical expressions. I borrow Arjun Appadurai's notion of ethnoscapes as a way to understand how diverse and sometimes seemingly incongruous influences are localized into Magindanaon music. These examples of Magindanaon forms that indigenize foreign influences lead me to argue that the Magindanao, like the hispanicized lowland Christian Filipinos, have a long tradition of localizing outside elements and transforming them into unique expressions. The examples I analyze overturn prevailing beliefs about how Muslim cultures of the Philippines are more insular or inwardly focused than lowland Christian culture---assumptions that drive debates about the authenticity of some Philippine cultures and not others. By doing so, I call into question simple binarisms created between distinctions such as ""Christian"" and ""Muslim,"" or ""traditional"" and ""modern.""",305034135,,Dissertations & Theses," Talusan, Mary I.TalusanI.MaryTalusan, Mary I.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1158510891 , 17515971 , 66569 , 9780542703867 , 3218677 , 3218677", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005, 9780542703867, English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305034135?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Music , Cultural anthropology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Cultural localization , Magindanaon , Moro , Music , Muslim , Philippines , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultural+localization+and+transnational+flows%3A++Music+in+the+Magindanaon+communities+of+the+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Talusan%2C+Mary+I.&amp;isbn=9780542703867&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3849,The economics of mercury pollution abatement in the New York - New Jersey Harbor watershed,"Mercury and methylmercury in the environment represent risks to human health and ecological systems. The main route of human exposure is through ingestion of contaminated fish. A mercury abatement plan for the NY/NJ Harbor uses the Industrial Ecology (IE) methodology to identify sources and pathways of mercury in the regional economy and estuary. Implementation of this plan requires that benefits outweigh abatement costs. A Cost Benefit Analysis framework is applied to evaluate the merits of the plan. The costs of mercury abatement are compared across sources from distinct sectors and media of release. Significant cost differences are found and an abatement cost curve is developed based on a simple cost minimization criteria. The findings from the IE analysis are then used to develop different weights, according to the amount of mercury reaching the receptors and the amount likely to become more toxic (methylmercury). Differentials in hazard suggest a system for weighting the pollution prevention value of specific sources. Thus, a new adjusted abatement curve integrates risk reduction criteria to cost minimization. Benefits ensuing from the abatement plan are difficult to isolate when dealing with a small region, other toxicants' interactions, or when human exposure is mediated by ingestion of fish, whose movements in and out of the system's boundary can't be modeled. Although some benefit categories are not quantifiable, benefits are seen to outweigh costs. The evaluation of the abatement plan is complicated by the dynamic nature of mercury pollution in the environment. An alternative valuation process makes use of “adaptive” institutions to consider the complex behavior and likely biological, chemical and physical responses ensuing from social and ecological systems' interactions. It is hypothesized that the different pollution prevention cost structures and differentially weighted value of discharges between various sources provides the economic basis for a market in mercury emissions permits. Such markets are considered as an economically efficient policy tool to achieve cost effective pollution reductions. However, mercury is found to have both global and regional/local forms of impact. A bi-furcated market structure is suggested to reflect this aspect of mercury pollution to prevent local “hot spots” of contamination.",305343839,,Dissertations & Theses," Panero, Marta AliciaPaneroAliciaMartaPanero, Marta Alicia", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 862925681 , 19841471 , 66569 , 9780496956234 , 049695623X , 3161873 , 3161873", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780496956234 , 049695623X", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305343839?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics," Economics , Public health , Environmental protection , Mercury , Fish , Costs , Prevention , Studies"," Social sciences , Emission trading , Harbor , Industrial ecology , Mercury pollution , New Jersey , New York , Pollution prevention , Watershed",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+economics+of+mercury+pollution+abatement+in+the+New+York+-+New+Jersey+Harbor+watershed&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Panero%2C+Marta+Alicia&amp;isbn=9780496956234&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3850,"Grassroots polycultures: Sustainability and resilience in Chiapas, Mexico","The relationship between organizational pluralism and the potential for long-term cultural, ecological, and economic sustainability and resilience is addressed in two regionally-based organizations of small-scale farmers involved with organic coffee and/or cacao production in Chiapas, Mexico. Both are supra-community organizations with primarily indigenous membership. However, the organizations vary with regard to the pluralism (ethnicity, language, religion, political ideology) inherent in each. The research reflects a dialogical research process in which participants were involved in the development of radio programs to promote the organizations (and their products) for international audiences. The audiotapes gathered for these programs explore participant's viewpoints concerning economic independence, social equity, autonomy, ecological ideas, and individual and collective identities. Working with one cooperative in the highlands, and one in the Lacandón jungle, comparisons were made between organizations in two distinct ecological contexts; an organization of members who had migrated and one whose members had not; and an organization whose primary source of internal cohesiveness was a common political ideology versus one whose principle collective identity was regionally-based stewardship of the environment. While currently the most “successful” of the two organizations is that with the most cohesive political ideology and the least internal pluralism (and which is affiliated with the Zapatista movement), this work suggests that the most pluralistic (with regard to ethnicity, language, and religion) of these organizations is developing a new regional, ecologically-based identity, which may provide the best prospect for long-term economic, ecological, and cultural sustainability and resilience.",305353458,,Dissertations & Theses," Schreiber, TatianaSchreiberTatianaSchreiber, Tatiana", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 932371851 , 27464781 , 66569 , 9780542189449 , 0542189445 , 3178921 , 3178921", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542189449 , 0542189445", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305353458?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0768 Environmental science , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0768 Environmental science , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0768 Environmental science , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0768 Environmental science , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Cultural anthropology , Environmental science , Agricultural economics"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Chiapas , Farmer organizations , Grassroots , Mexico , Polycultures , Resilience , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grassroots+polycultures%3A+Sustainability+and+resilience+in+Chiapas%2C+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schreiber%2C+Tatiana&amp;isbn=9780542189449&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3851,"The impact of online experiences, shared during an undergraduate mathematics course, on mathematics identity","Reform movements in mathematics education abound over the past 30 years. The educational community is seeking ways to improve mathematics instruction. This introspection is occurring at all levels, from preschool to post-graduate education. Undergraduate mathematics education is one of these foci. Students report diminished confidence in doing mathematics at each educational level. By the time they graduate with a baccalaureate degree, few report confidence in mathematics or a strong mathematics self-concept. Research is emerging that expands the notions of previous decades regarding cooperative education and constructivist methodologies to the field of social learning theory and communities of practice. This new paradigm suggests that healthy participation within informal communities can have strong impact on identity of participants. In addition, research suggests that participants in online environments have come to engage each other in interesting ways that promote discussion, feedback, humor, and generally less formal dialogue. It is a reasonable conjecture that online environments may have a positive effect on affect. Finally, the notion of mathematical identities has been the focus of much research, primarily in the context of traditional face-to-face instruction. There is a gap in research in the overlap of these 3 conceptual areas: social learning theory, online education, and mathematical identity. How does participating in online interactions related to an undergraduate mathematics course affect students' perceptions of their own mathematical identity? This study gathered over 16,000 lines of narratives by 30 students involved in 2 sections of an undergraduate liberal arts mathematics course. These narratives consisted of transcripts of synchronous online sessions, asynchronous discussion thread postings, and focus-group interviews. Global characteristics and trends were analyzed for the entire cohorts. Six students were selected for more in-depth analysis, three from each section. The major findings of the study were that students generally had reduced mathematics anxiety levels, increased mathematics self-confidence, and increased mathematics self-concept. In addition, it was found that female students were more inclined to discuss their personal mathematics identity than their male counterparts.

Drawing on oral histories, visual culture, and archival research, I demonstrate how cultural geography and social movements have cultivated and complicated new art forms. I also show the tandem evolution of a Latino arts movement with the politics of a global Left. In chapter one, I juxtapose the cultivation of a Latin nightlife in North Beach in the post-World War II period with the physical displacement of Latinos from the area then known as the Latin Quarter. In chapter two, I argue for the importance of a 1950s Beat, or bohemian, culture in stimulating the creative interests of many Latinos in San Francisco, in spite of their marginalized position as participants. Chapter three traces the beginnings of a Latino arts enclave in San Francisco's Mission District and the initial institutions and ad hoc groups that facilitated its growth. In chapter four, I use the experience of three Chicano artists---Yolanda Lopez, Rupert Garcia, and Juan Fuentes---to contextualize the significance of the 1968 Third World Strike in shaping their political consciousness and their art. Chapter five elaborates on the gender divisions permeating neighborhood arts activism through a study of two community murals, ""Homage to Siquieros,"" and ""Latinoamerica,"" each crafted by a team of male and female muralists, respectively. I conclude with chapter six, a study of Día de los Muertos and how its traditional expressions of mourning became more politically oriented with the impact of AIDS and the civil wars in Central America. The subsequent commodification of Día de los Muertos and the rising property values of the Mission District bring this work full circle back to a discussion of consumption, avant-garde politics, and physical and cultural displacement.",305373484,,Dissertations & Theses," Cordova, CaryCordovaCaryCordova, Cary", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1147173881 , 27199091 , 66569 , 9780542649530 , 3215349 , 3215349", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005, 9780542649530, English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305373484?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American studies , Art history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Art , California , Identity , Latino , Mission District , San Francisco",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+heart+of+the+Mission%3A+Latino+art+and+identity+in+San+Francisco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cordova%2C+Cary&amp;isbn=9780542649530&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3853,Le discours sur la réforme de la santé au Venezuela: La transition Chávez (1999–2001),"The present dissertation is about the health reform discourse in Venezuela, during a recent period of its history which has been dominated by a process of institutional and normative changes under the government of Hugo Chávez. This period can be described as a transition characterized by an official rhetoric proposing a recuperation of the founding myths of the Venezuelan Republic. This case presents a first problem. The bolivarian revolution of Chávez is a movement that in its discourse argues against a form of problematic or incomplete modernization. Its rhetoric is uttered in the context of a country integrated to world economy and culture. This situation places the Venezuelan process in the hybridization frame, confronting tensions and contradictions in a society dealing at the same time with tradition and modernity. The notion of reflexivity in the context of high modernity, according to Giddens, is the first theoretical reference to explain the rationality guiding health reforms in the Western World. This concept is particularly helpful to understand the increased search for individual autonomy confronted with different institutional settings. However, Giddens' conceptual frame is not sufficient to analyze a ease like the Venezuelan health reform under Chávez regime. Some of the elements of chavista rhetoric express a cultural hybridization, as it is defined by García Canclini (1995), and also reflect a reinvention of tradition according to Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983). It was necessary to explore the implications of an incomplete modernity in order to explain how a process of hybride traditionalization affects health policies and social representations on health issues. The hybride dimension of this research required to study the multiples influences of globalization in the discourses and practices related to health care. The theoretical framework is complemented by a discussion of the communications role in the health care field, particularly in health reforms. Communication is analyzed under a double perspective. First, communication is understood as a social reproduction tool and institutional legitimization. Second, communication is also the expression of what sociologist Lash calls the other reflexivity, more symbolic than rational. The methodological approach is based on a discourse analysis performed on three levels: the institutional/official level, the media level and the expert level. The analysis has been made following a model that explains public discourse on health as the expression of a double rationality: one attached to an administrative logic of health economics, and another one more existential appealing to folk medicine, magic, myths, values and tradition. The analysis of these discourses shows two major findings: (a) hybridization and reinvention of tradition represent rhetorical resources with a highly persuasive force in societies facing a crisis and looking for a promise of Total Health; (b) according to the discourse pragmatics, this rhetoric has to confront the contingencies and limitations of material and cultural frameworks which drive the action of the actors involved in the reform. It can be said that if its true that chavista rhetoric has achieved the mobilization of a very large portion of the Venezuelan society because of its questioning of incomplete modernization, there is also a parallel dynamic limiting the scope of retraditionalization in a plural society, which is looking for more reflexive autonomy and is highly integrated to the global sphere, both factors deterring the hegemonic claims of the state.",305377369,,Dissertations & Theses," Nahon-Serfaty, IsaacNahon-SerfatyIsaacNahon-Serfaty, Isaac", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 982792001 , 27200871 , 66569 , 9780494055359 , 0494055359 , NR05535 , NR05535", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780494055359 , 0494055359", French, French,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305377369?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media,, 0708 Mass media, Mass media," Communication and the arts , Chavez Frias, Hugo , Discourse , French text , Health reform , Hugo Chavez Frias , Venezuela",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Le+discours+sur+la+r%C3%A9forme+de+la+sant%C3%A9+au+Venezuela%3A++La+transition+Ch%C3%A1vez+%281999%E2%80%932001%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nahon-Serfaty%2C+Isaac&amp;isbn=9780494055359&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3854,Wahhabism in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the context of global political Islam,"Wahhabi Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a relatively new phenomenon. Before the 1992-1995, this interpretation of Islam was unknown to most of the Bosnian Muslims, as they follow another school of Islamic thought. However, with the disintegration of the Former Yugoslavia, and outbreak of hostilities, Bosnian Muslims were subjected to ethnic cleansing and genocide, and witnessed destruction of their cultural and religious heritage. Felt deserted by the West, the Bosnian government turned to others for help. Those included Islamic charities, which, outraged at what had been happening to their fellow Muslims, were sending assistance in form of humanitarian aid, equipment, weapons and volunteers, also known as Mujahedin . With them came the Wahhabi Islam, as majority of those charities were from Saudi Arabia, where Wahhabism is the official state creed. The Bosnians were at first grateful, but as time passed, they grew more and more uncomfortable with the presence of foreign fighters and Wahhabi missionaries, as some of them had been very aggressive in the way they imposed their religious views. Some even committed war crimes during the war against members of other ethnic groups. However, a small number of Bosnians accepted the new form of Islam, and were determined to spread it as far as they could. The initial aggressiveness of the Wahhabi movement and incidents they staged subsided after September 11 th terrorist attacks, as a result of efforts of Bosnian authorities to do their share in the global ""war on terror"". Still Wahhabis managed to survive the difficult times, and continue to spread their message. However, the message has not gone far, as majority of Bosnian Muslims chose not to follow their ideas. Therefore, Wahhabi mission in Bosnia failed, and Bosnia never became Islamic state ruled by Islamic law. Although still active, the movement remains on the margins of social and political life in Bosnia. The purpose of this Thesis is to analyze Wahhabism in Bosnia in a wider context of events that paved the way for the emergence of political Islam, Wahhabism as a religious preaching and later ideology, and in the historical background of Bosnian Muslims' aspirations for self-determination and political organization.",305377632,,Dissertations & Theses," Imamovic, AlmaImamovicAlmaImamovic, Alma", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1320933431 , 36643921 , 66569 , 1443928 , 1443928", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005,, English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305377632?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science",," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science"," Religion , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Wahhabism+in+Bosnia+and+Herzegovina+in+the+context+of+global+political+Islam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Imamovic%2C+Alma&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3855,"Japanese immigrant women in Los Angeles, 1912–1942: A transnational perspective","This dissertation examines the transnational histories of Japanese immigrant (Issei) women from their youth in Japan to their settlement in the United States. It analyzes the influences of Japanese culture that created the ethnic identity of Issei women. Americans have viewed Issei women as passive participants in the history of Japanese immigration to the United States. They have described them as ""traditional"" and subordinate to men. Unlike the conventional perspective, which turns Issei women into an anonymous, inarticulate, and passive mass, this study describes Issei women as actors who created their own futures. This study also questions the idea---common in transgenerational studies of Japanese Americans---that Issei women were ""traditional"" and unchanging replicators of a fixed Japanese culture. Issei customs are, of course, ""traditional"" if one compares them with those of the Nisei and Sansei. Emphasizing the impact of ancient Japanese traditions, however, overlooks Japan's effort to Westernize its social system after the Meiji Restoration. Such interpretations also ignore the fact that some in the Issei community warned about the dangers of enforcing Japanese customs on their descendants.

The interface between migration, disease transmission, and demography is of central importance today; however, understanding the interrelationships among these factors is difficult due to confounding factors. Much can be learned from historical case studies, particularly in island populations. First, the role of migration in disease transmission can be more readily disentangled than in contemporary populations. Second, changes in the health and demography of populations were often drastic after foreigners arrived and clearly related to introduced disease. Episodes of colonialism allow for a clear picture of how the movement of people and social and environmental change are associated with population health and demographic change. This dissertation focuses on the interplay between gonorrhea and tuberculosis transmission, labor migration, and demography in Micronesia during the Japanese colonial period (1919–1945). It also identifies lessons for more complex and contemporary settings involving other diseases and cultural norms. First, this dissertation illustrates the potential demographic consequences of uncontrolled epidemics. Although disease is not usually thought of as having a large impact on fertility, this work shows that it should not be discounted. Especially before treatment, gonorrhea epidemics could be large and devastating, and could trigger depopulation. Fertility usually has a larger impact on population growth than mortality. However, in a situation of an uncontrolled epidemic such as tuberculosis on Yap during the Japanese occupation, increases in mortality rates were a greater determinant of population growth than were depressed fertility rates from gonorrhea infections. Second, this dissertation uses a simulation model to clarify the role of migration in disease transmission. A general assumption is that return migrants are responsible for spreading infection. This work shows that the assumed association between circular migration and STD transmission at home depends on the etiology of disease and social climate. Migrants should not be blamed for inciting epidemics without detailed research. One needs to look closer at (1) the specific characteristics of the disease, and (2) the behaviors of the migrants before conclusions can be drawn.",305386678,,Dissertations & Theses," Cassels, Susan LynnCasselsLynnSusanCassels, Susan Lynn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 888842291 , 27784581 , 66569 , 9780542059445 , 0542059444 , 3169788 , 3169788", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542059445 , 0542059444", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305386678?accountid=14496, 0938 Demographics, 0938 Demographics, 0938 Demographics,, 0938 Demographics, Demographics," Social sciences , Disease , Health , Japanese occupation , Labor migration , Micronesia , Population dynamics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Population+dynamics%2C+health%2C+and+labor+migration+in+Micronesia%0Aduring+the+Japanese+occupation%2C+1919%E2%80%931945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cassels%2C+Susan+Lynn&amp;isbn=9780542059445&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3857,"Visualizing human rights: Photography, atrocity, and the ethical imagination","Photography has been integral to the conceptualization of human rights. Human rights are envisaged through the experience of regarding photographs, in particular, photographs of atrocity. Photographic mediation is important to the recognition of atrocity because psychoanalysis has shown that traumatic events contain a paradox of seeing: the psyche is unable to grasp such events as they occur. Given this dilemma, the photograph's ability to arrest a historical moment is important because it provides a spectator the means for recognition of the traumatic event afterwards. Indeed, the recognition of another's suffering as atrocious and unjust may require aesthetic mediation. A paradox haunts this recognition, however, because to encounter an image of atrocity is precisely to encounter the loss of human dignity. Human rights are irrevocably shadowed by their failure. Hannah Arendt's late work, Freudian psychoanalysis, and two case studies support the central claim. The first case study investigates the Congo Reform Association (1904-1913), the first international human rights movement to use atrocity photographs as a campaign tool. The CRA enticed its generation by providing spectators with the illusion of distant intervention, setting into motion the ideal of universal human rights. In this initial engagement, reformers constructed human rights as a dream , that is, as a wishful discourse in which all humans possessed an inalienable dignity. This dream has been unconsciously carried into current conceptions of human rights. My second case study examines representations of the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda in the 1990's, where humanitarian intervention was again demanded based on photographic evidence of atrocity. As in the Congo, no intervention arrived and here apathy in the face of atrocity can be understood as a residue of the traumatic impact of genocidal violence. The dissertation finds that although photographs fail to enact intervention in any efficacious, political sense, they do provide important occasions to work through social breakdown: rather than a call for action, images of atrocity provide occasion to exercise the faculties of judgement and thought. Such poignant response to the loss of human dignity offers an alternate definition of ethical responsibility, and in turn, an alternate basis for human rights.",305390289,,Dissertations & Theses," Sliwinski, SharonSliwinskiSharonSliwinski, Sharon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1083540191 , 32782711 , 66569 , 9780494116302 , 0494116307 , NR11630 , NR11630", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780494116302 , 0494116307", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305390289?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," Philosophy, religion and theology , Atrocity , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Congo Reform Association , Ethical imagination , Human rights , Photography , Rwanda , Visualizing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visualizing+human+rights%3A+Photography%2C+atrocity%2C+and+the+ethical+imagination&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sliwinski%2C+Sharon&amp;isbn=9780494116302&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3858,"Literary labor: Reform and resistance in American literature, 1936–1945","After the National Labor Relations Board was established in 1935, the impulse toward collective affiliation in American literature grew, diminishing the authenticity of the individual agent in fiction and poetry while also interrogating the nature of writing as a skilled occupation. As we well know, many writers responded to this movement with a body of protest literature which emphasized international trade union solidarity and the vitality of organized labor. I argue, however, that works by Robert Frost, Muriel Rukeyser, Richard Wright, and Gwendolyn Brooks reveal a neglected struggle to make figurative “unions” within poor communities that are denied this institutional support. As they anxiously redefine their personal liberties and shared responsibilities as laborers, these authors also formalize the literary controversy over individual authority that arose during the 1930s. Challenging the forces of liberal interdependence which rapidly changed American life after the New Deal by defending the singularity of literary labor against movements toward collective affiliation, the four authors concurrently—and perhaps ironically—expose unionism's most glaring failures. Therefore, while they openly argue for democratic social reforms, their works implicitly resist the new institutional discourse of collectivity upon which those reforms depend.",305402739,,Dissertations & Theses," Duncan, James BryanDuncanBryanJamesDuncan, James Bryan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 953996501 , 17766271 , 66569 , 9780542218446 , 0542218445 , 3181097 , 3181097", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542218446 , 0542218445", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305402739?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American literature , American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Brooks, Gwendolyn , Frost, Robert , Gwendolyn Brooks , Labor , Muriel Rukeyser , Reform , Resistance , Richard Wright , Robert Frost , Rukeyser, Muriel , Wright, Richard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Literary+labor%3A+Reform+and+resistance+in+American+literature%2C%0A1936%E2%80%931945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Duncan%2C+James+Bryan&amp;isbn=9780542218446&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3859,"The fantasms of science: Psychical research in the French Third Republic, 1880–1935","This dissertation focuses on psychical research in France and its relation to the human sciences---particularly to the emergence of scientific psychology. As part of an international scientific movement, psychical research in France flourished when leading scholars turned their attention to the popular religious practice of spiritism and organized a collective study of the so-called ""mediumistic phenomena""---table-rapping, table-turning, spirit manifestations, automatic writing, and the transmission of thought. Internationally, the field drew the participation of such eminent scholars as philosopher Henry Sidgwick, psychologist Frederic Myers, philosopher William James, and criminologist Cesare Lombroso. In France, these men were joined in their efforts by researchers like philosopher Henri Bergson, physiologist Charles Richet, astronomer Camille Flammarion, and psychologist Pierre Janet. Psychical research was at the forefront of a larger effort in the human sciences to account for unconscious mental activity. This effort became relevant in France just as the Third Republic was instituting a social order based on a self-possessed ""citizen"" whose desires could be known and addressed to the representative body of the state. In psychical research, the attempt to verify the reality of mediumistic phenomena came to an impasse in suspicions of fraud and self-deception. These instances of doubt marked the realization of a subjectivity (the unconscious) external to the representative space of science and democracy. Committed to the universality of scientific knowledge, psychical researchers continued to view their uncertainty as the product of experimental shortcomings. Thus, in the same period in which Freud was recognizing the fundamentally enigmatic character of the unconscious, psychical researchers persisted in the notion that, with reliable experience, science could render the subject's desire fully intelligible as an object of public knowledge.",305433518,,Dissertations & Theses," Brower, Matthew BradyBrowerBradyMatthewBrower, Matthew Brady", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1031039631 , 18215161 , 66569 , 9780542411229 , 0542411229 , 3195660 , 3195660", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542411229 , 0542411229", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305433518?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history , 0320 Religious history"," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history , 0320 Religious history"," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history , 0320 Religious history",," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history , 0320 Religious history"," European history , Science history , Religious history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , French , Psychical research , Science , Spiritualism , Third Republic",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+fantasms+of+science%3A++Psychical+research+in+the+French%0AThird+Republic%2C+1880%E2%80%931935&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brower%2C+Matthew+Brady&amp;isbn=9780542411229&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3860,"Inside &lt;i&gt;Myôjô&lt;/i&gt; (Venus, 1900–1908): Art for the nation's sake","This dissertation examines the modern Japanese magazine Myôjô (Venus, 1900–1908). Myôjô 's legacy endures as a repository of romanticism, poetry, visual art and late Meiji figures, including the poets, Yosano Akiko and Ishikawa Takuboku, and artists, Fujishima Takeji and Nagahara Shisui. Instead of looking at Myôjô as a source for individual movements, genres or historical figures, however, my study looks at Myôjô itself. By viewing Myôjô as the literary and visual arts magazine ( bungei bijutsu zasshi ) that its editor Yosano Tekkan (Hiroshi) and his group of collaborators collectively known as the Myôjô group intended, my study explores the Myôjô group's mission to promote the arts, or geijutsu . As a composite product of the New Poetry Society ( Shinshisha ) and the western-style painting coterie White Horse Society ( Hakubakai ), Myôjô proposed self-cultivation in the arts in order to prevent what the Myôjô group perceived as the decline of Japanese civilization. The Myôjô group's encouragement of the global exchange of arts, advocating cosmopolitanism, places it within the wider network of contemporaneous western arts magazines such as Jugend (Youth, 1895–1932). The intersection of Myôjô 's diverse texts and images with late Meiji cultural discourse forms the basis of the chapters. The first chapter examines the Myôjô 's group's response to the government censorship of Myôjô 's November 1900 publication of nudes within the context of the Meiji period Debate on Nudes ( Rataiga ronsô ) and from the perspective of the banning as a defining moment in the magazine's efforts to civilize the nation through cultivation of individual taste ( shumi ). The second chapter looks at the Myôjô group's response to the public's preoccupation with the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), exploring the war as a rupture in the free pursuit of learning that threatened to undermine the Myôjô group's mission of self-cultivation in the arts. The third chapter addresses the individual and how the Myôjô group cultivated the individual as civic-minded artist to contribute to the civilization of Japan. Refusing to accommodate the post-war rise of naturalism ( shizenshugi ) and its endorsement of the individual as severed from social obligation, Myôjô folded, having helped to institutionalize the arts in modern Japan.",305434234,,Dissertations & Theses," Cuccio, Claire S.CuccioS.ClaireCuccio, Claire S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 982789051 , 19840681 , 66569 , 9780542285806 , 0542285800 , 3186334 , 3186334", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542285806 , 0542285800", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305434234?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0377 Art history , 0332 History"," 0305 Asian literature , 0377 Art history , 0332 History"," 0305 Asian literature , 0377 Art history , 0332 History",," 0305 Asian literature , 0377 Art history , 0332 History"," Asian literature , Art history , History"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Art magazine , Degeneration , Japan , Myojo , Self-cultivation , Venus",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Inside+My%C3%B4j%C3%B4+%28Venus%2C+1900%E2%80%931908%29%3A%0AArt+for+the+nation%27s+sake&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cuccio%2C+Claire+S.&amp;isbn=9780542285806&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3861,Folklore and alternative masculinities in a rave scene,"The rave is a late 20 th century local and global ritualized entertainment that attracts mainly middle-class white youth and young adults to ecstatic trance dance and electronic dance music. Throughout the 1990s, raves were known as places of drug use, racial/class mixing, and sexual experimentation. With a DJ booth and a dance floor—sometimes in an abandoned warehouse, beach, or boat—the rave event fostered community and creativity. I argue that there is a transformation from ideal masculinity to alternative masculinities by bodily awareness through ecstatic trance dance facilitated by the ritual aspects of raving—the rave experience. In my schema the rave experience is an amalgamation of belonging, collectivity, deterritorialization, ecstatic trance dance, lighting, repetitive beats of house music, vibes, fashion, and a psychedelic amphetamine Ecstasy. Ecstatic trance dancing provides a positive outlet for the release of emotions and feelings that many men feel they must repress in order to be an “ideal” man. Male ravers have become more aware of their bodies since raving through dance by moving to the repetitive beats. My ethnographic observations especially noted uses of the dancing male body to decenter gender enactment via the ecstatic trance dance. The dancing male body is reconstituted as a floating signifier—it has an unfixed nature of meanings on the dance floor due to ecstatic trance dance which shakes off gender gestures coded as “masculine” (macho “stiffness”) thus decentering the male from the dancing body. Male ravers dance by rhythmically moving of their bodies to the repetitive beats. Sometimes the meanings of movements are self-directed and conscious—the freezing and flowing of the body. At other raves the body “instinctually” reacts to the music. Repetitive beats at raves are sources of energy for non-stop dancing. The repetitive beats at a rave work like a drug, intoxicating the body, making it do something—to move, to trance. To dance at a rave means the ability to express a wide range of emotions and feelings that normally some men would be pressured to restrain. Ecstatic trance dance uncouples overt sexuality from social dance by encouraging free dance styles.",305458690,,Dissertations & Theses," Avery, Anthony P.AveryP.AnthonyAvery, Anthony P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 982788761 , 27199131 , 66569 , 9780542263828 , 0542263823 , 3184418 , 3184418", Dissertation/Thesis, 2005," 9780542263828 , 0542263823", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305458690?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music"," 0323 American studies , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music"," 0323 American studies , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music",," 0323 American studies , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music"," American studies , Dance , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Alternative masculinities , Folklore , Masculinity , Rave , Trance dance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Folklore+and+alternative+masculinities+in+a+rave+scene&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Avery%2C+Anthony+P.&amp;isbn=9780542263828&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"
