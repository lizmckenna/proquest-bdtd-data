Anti-globalization looks like a shadow of globalization, they battle with each other. Since the Seattle storm which opens the curtain of anti-globalization movement at the end of 1999, anti-globalization movement has become an important political power in the international society, From Davos to France Nice, from New York to Quebec in Canada, from Bangkok to Porto Alegre in Brazil, everywhere in the world has left the footsteps of the anti-globalization movement activists. As a kind of protest politics, the scale and scenes of the anti-globalization movement are very easy to make people think of new social movements that appeared in the west since the end of 1960s. what relations are they? This thesis regarded the anti-globalization movement as a kind of new social movements in the context of globalization, and analysis the inner structures, action forms and impact factors of the anti-globalization movement in the perspective of new social movement theory Systematically. The author thought the anti-globalization movement is not only a kind of continuation and development of new social movements in the new international background, it can be called “new-new social movements”, but also it has challenged the further development of new social movement theory. The thesis has six parts, the main points of each part are as follows : Introduction, This part mainly explained the reasons why the author selected this topic and the significance of the selection of subjects, Comment the current state of research about this subject. At the same time, this part would present a framework of the thesis. At the end of the 20th century, the anti-globalization movement launched in the international society, which has attracted world attention and become a hotspot of academic research. The reasons that the author choose the anti-globalization movement in the perspective of the new social movement theory as the target of analysis are: First, as a “new politics” phenomenon after World War II in Western, new social movements and the anti-globalization movement are an important clues for understanding the social change in the west. Second, as the anti-system movement, new social movements and the anti-globalization movement have many similarities. Third, selecting the perspective of new social movement theory to study the anti-globalization movement, not only help us to understand grassroots people how to express their interest demands and maintenance their political rights and economic interests in the international context of global governance, but also help us to increase understanding and awareness of transnational social movements from another side. Four, the author choose this topic also come from the consideration for subjects. In the west, the research on new social movements is more comprehensive, which mainly concentrate in three dimensions: the study on new social movements protests, the theory research on how to explain new social movements and the research about new social movements research methods. However, Generally speaking, academe（especially political science field）to new social movements’ research is still extremely weak in china. For the anti-globalization movement, in academe, scholars have reached consensus on why the anti-globalization is appeared and what is anti-globalization and other issues. However, using the perspective of new social movement to analysis the inherent structure, movement forms, organizational forms of the anti-globalization movement is weak. Thus, It is an important theoretical and practical significance of selecting the perspective of the new social movement theory to analysis the anti-globalization movement. This article attempts to make a try. ChapterⅠ, new social movements and new social movement theory modes. New social movements is a floorboard mainly aim to mean a series of masses protest movements accompanied by the students movement since the late 1960s in the West, which present varied size and have the different interests of the demands. It is “new”, because it demonstrated some new features. In this part, on base of defining the content and characteristics of social movements and new social movements, the author analysis four kinds of new social movement modes, that is, the theory of modern contradiction, the theory of post-materialism, resource mobilization theory and political opportunity structure. And point out each theory has its shortcoming and deficiencies, Synthesizing four theory modes, the author conformity a comprehensive new social movement theory mode and its analytical elements, Its main contents are: The main people of the movement not only present the features of specific socio-economic structure and demographic characteristics, but also demonstrate the characteristics of strong political participation awareness and “post-materialism” values tendencies; The issues of movement have the characteristic of ""post-ideological era"" political topics and the color of “post-materialism”; The modes of movement have the characteristics of super-councils, the direct participation of non-conventional; The organizational forms of movement are decentralized, fragmentation, grassroots democracy and the characteristics of “political opportunity” impact on the patterns of movement. ChapterⅡ, the anti-globalization movement: development stage and main features. In this chapter, the author began from defining two concepts: globalization and anti-globalization, on basis of comparing with the similarities of the anti-globalization movement and the new social movements, the author redefined anti-globalization movement, that is, regard anti-globalization movement as a kind of new social movements. Then in reference to Western scholars about different divide methods of the development stages of the protest movement cycle, according to the internal and external factors that impacted on anti-globalization movement, the author divided anti-globalization movement that since the beginning of 1990s into five phases, and generalized the characteristics of each phase simply. Chapter III, anti-globalization movement in the perspective of new social movement theory. In this chapter, in order to explain why anti-globalization movement is appeared and how anti-globalization movement is developed in-depth, the author analysis the main bodies，issues, action forms, organization forms and political opportunity of the anti-globalization movement in the perspective of new social movement theory Systematically. Then, the author pointed out anti-globalization movement is a kind of continuation and development of new social movements in the new globalization background, it can be called“new-new social movements”. Chapter IV, the challenge of anti-globalization movement to new social movement theory. New social movement theory can provide basic explanation for the anti-globalization movement, however, its own limitations and the new features of anti-globalization movement have decided new social movement theory can not provide a full and comprehensive explanation for anti-globalization movement. In this chapter, the author first point out new social movement theory has four limitations: the limitations of the scope of application, the limitations of the era, and the limitations of the analysis methodology and model. Then enunciated the new features of the anti-globalization movement on the main people, the issues, movement forms, organizational forms, etc. Given these two aspects, the author think that the new social movement theory should shift theoretical perspective, expand theoretical vision, and perfect analysis models in the era of globalization. Conclusion, the author point out the future development of anti-globalization movement and some change factors. The research methods are adopted as follows: The first is the method of integrating condensation with individual case study. Which mainly represent in two sides: One side is the relations of four kinds of new social movement theories and the comprehensive new social movement theory. Any theory is not leave nothing to be desired, it has its own shortcomings regardless of what kind of theoretical modes, So as four new social movement theoretical modes in this thesis. However, when elaborating on new social movements, they are not mutually exclusive, but mutually complementary. Thus they can be used synthetically. Another side is the relations of new social movements and anti-globalization movement. Anti-globalization movement is new social movement, but it is not new social movement in traditional sense. This paper choose anti-globalization movement as the target of analysis not only can help knowledge and understand the development of new social movements in the context of globalization in-depth on one hand, on the other hand, it can contribute to further perfect new social movement theory. The second is the combination of quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, but mainly give priority to qualitative analysis. To enhance the analysis intensity of new social movement theory on the anti-globalization movement, this article seeks to do quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis combined. However, because the information currently available is limited, somewhat weak in the area of quantitative analysis, Therefore, this paper give priority to qualitative analysis. The third is dynamic process analysis. Times is changing, so is the practice of new social movements. From the perspective of dynamic, the paper divided the development phase of the anti-globalization movement and regarded anti-globalization movement as the development of new social movements since the late of 1960s, In this paper, the author thought new social movement theory also should do corresponding adjustment and changes accompanied by the practical development of new social movements, Only in this way can new social movement theory itself maintain vigor and vitality. On the whole, the paper reflects the dynamic process analysis.",1026687189, 新社会运动理论视角下的反全球化运动,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, YingLiuYingLiu, Ying刘颖",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713272161 , 70560512 , 189128 , H286119 , H286119", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese, 新社会运动理论视角下的反全球化运动,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026687189?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAIH286119 , Social sciences , 反全球化运动 , 新社会运动 , 新社会运动理论",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+anti-globalization+movements+in+the+perspective+of+new+social+movement+theory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"2,On Socia Contradiction of the New Eya,"On the basis of a reflection of history, with a shift of research paradigm, and against the background of the economic globalization and informationalization, the present paper systematically studies such issues as the sources and development of social contradictions in our country under the circumstance of reform and socialist market economy, their characteristics, principle and method of treatment, while focusing, in particular, on some prominent questions of social contradictions of the present time. It is assumed to be of great significance, both practically and theoretically, for a deeper understanding of Mao Zedong's theory on social contradictions, and it is meant to promote the implementation of the opening-up and reform policy for the socialist construction and modernization. Apart from the introduction, the paper is composed of four chapters. A summary of each chapter runs as follows: Chapter One elaborates on the necessity and validity of a shift of theoretical paradigm with the point of view of historical development of the theory of socialist social contradictions. In the history of Marxism, theories on contradictions in the socialist countries have gone through a process of explication and deepening Marx, Engels, Lenin and Starlin have all explored the problem of socialist contradictions, and have accumulated some invaluable thoughts on contradictions in socialist countries. Guided by Marxism, Mao Zedong set up, systematically, the theory of socialist contradictions on the basis of rich experience in socialist revolution and construction in China, thus further enhancing Marxism. In On the Ten Major Relationships, On How to Deal with contradictions within the People, he elaborated on the socialist contradictions systematically forming a theoretical system about the contradictions in socialist societies and providing us with a clear direction in handing the contradictions in the socialist countries in a right way, and a theoretical guideline in consolidating, developing and perfecting the socialist system-But due to the historical limit, Mao Zedong's theory on contradictions in socialist societies was inevitably constrained by the time in which he lived. His description of the basic contradictions in socialist societies is too abstract, his judgement of the basic contradictions is wrong, and his criteria for the differentiation of the two kinds of contradictions are too vague, the scope too narrow and methods in dealing with them too simple. At present, the pattern of social structure has undergone tremendous changes. The transformation of the society and the pattern of communication between people, the development of science and technology require that we approach contradictions in socialist societies in a different way. First, we have to shift our emphasis from analyzing social classes to analyzing social spectra and group interest; secondly, we have to move away from the studies of social relationships to the studies of more specific interpersonal relationships; and thirdly, we must put our emphasis on the study of individuals of the society, including their psychological aspect, rather than just focus on the society as a whole. Chapter Two examines the formation and development of social contradictions of the new era in our country from the point of view of important changes in the world and inten1ational situations, the opening-up and reform, the establishment of the socialist market economy, varieties of social structures, social classes and social stratification, and development of modern science and technology. Contradictions in socialist societies result from many different sources. First of all great changes of the world situation have influenced the formation of social problems in China m the new ear; peace and development have become the theme of the time, contradiction and confrontations between China as a socialist country and other capitalist counties have been eased to relatively great extent. The major contradiction that we are faced with is one between the ever-increasing demand of the broad masses for material civilization and the inability of the backward productivity of supply. The emphasis of the Party and the State is to develop the social productivity in a big way, focusing on the construction of economy. Secondly, the world-wide socialist movement has suffered great setback, and the “peaceful transformation"" targeted on China by western countries has also affected the social contradictions in China. Because of the disaggregation of the former Soviet Union and the social upheaval in the Eastern European counties, the international communist movement has suffered great setback and damages, Western countries headed by the United States which have long been carrying out a policy of westernization, separation, weakening and peaceful transformation, have now turned their target on China. Thirdly, economic globalization has quickened its pace, which has also influenced the formation of social contradictions of our country. Economic globalization has promoted the nourishment and development of world economy, and has provided the economy of our country with a chance of development in history, which in turn bring about some negative effect. It may erode the economic sovereignty of the country. The contradiction and conflicts of the two systems have become more direct and acute. Our country is faced with the penetration of the western ideology in this process of globalization. Fourthly, further reform and the establishment of socialist market economic system have greatly influenced the emergence and development of social contradictions of the new time in our country. The economic reform that we are carrying out is not confined to sphere of economy; it has extended to the gelds of politics, culture, education, science and technology. It is m all-round reform in that it has brought about great changes in people's mentality, value system, notion of justice, way of life and norm of action, and a series of new problems. To reform on the economic system will necessarily lead to dramatic changes in the structure of ownership, ways of distribution, which give rise to the tremendous readjustment of social structure and relationships, thus resulting in the multi-interest pattern of different social spectra and interest groups. The great readjustment of social structure and social relationship caused by an economic system being transformed from a planned one to a market one will surely bring about various conf1icts in interest, new social problems and contradictions. The diversification and combination of classes and social spectra are the outcome of the reform and establishment of the socialist market economic system. It is a reflection of progress of the Chinese society. Though people at different social spectrum have the same general interest, when coming to specific questions, they vary a great deal. Different spectra have different interests, and they will surely run into conflicts with each other, thus resulting in some contradictions among different social spectra. After World War II, science and technology has advanced by leaps and bounds. But the revolution in science and technology this time is characterized by a combination of science with technology. While science is being technologized, technology also shows a tendency of being more scientific. Science and technology of the present time are penetrating into every aspect of the productive system, and every element of production shows some features of science and technology-Science and technology have become a major force that pushes production forward. They are the main drive of social progress. The new revolution in science and technology has changed man's mode of production, way of living and thinking, and pattern of communication, and has tremendously improved the quality of man's life. But at the same time, it has brought about many new social problems and conflicts: unemployment is on the increase; old moral standard clashes with the new one; and development of high-tech, especially that of the internet technology, is further complicating the existing contradictions in the field of culture. All of this adds to the liability of the intensification of contradictions between man and nature, and creates potential threats to the strategy of sustained development of our country. Chapter Three discusses the structure of the social contradiction system of our country in the new era, its characteristics and ways of treatment. Social contradictions in our country in the new time can be classified, in accordance with their structural characteristics, into basic contradictions, main contradictions, and specific contradictions of various gelds. The major contradiction at the present stage in China, i.e. the ever-increasing demands of the people for material civi1ization, are determined by the nature, characteristics and mode of movement of the country's basic contradictions at its initial stage of socialism, together with the country's backward social production at the present stage. The basic contradictions of a socialist society are reflected in such specific fields as economy, politics, ideology and culture, constituting the concrete contradictions in each field respectively. The contradiction of production and consumption is the main contradiction in the field of economy. In the field of politics in the socia1ist society, the contradiction between democracy and centralization is the main contradiction, which affects every aspect of the socialist political life. The contradiction between Marxism and non-Marxism is the main contradiction that constrains and affects other contradictions in the field of culture or ideology. The contradiction system in the socialist society consists of basic contradictions, major contradictions and specific contradictions in every other field. Of the three ranks of contradictions, basic contradictions lie at the basic level, functioning as the dominating factor which determines the nature of major contradictions and the form of specific contradictions. Major contradictions lie at the intermediate level, functioning as the leading factor which is dominated by the basic contradictions, and reversely affects the basic contradictions; at the same time, they provide solutions for the specific contradictions; specific contradictions lie at the subordinating position, which are dominated and goven1ed by the basic contradictions and major contradictions, but they may also affect the movement and solution of the basic and major contradictions. Basic contradictions, major contradictions and specific contradictions are related to each other, affect and are affected by each other, confine and are confined by each other, and interact with each other, thus constituting a system of contradictions in the socialist society. Generally speaking, the social contradictions of the new time, i.e. the basic contradictions and major contradictions of our country at the present stage, is non-confrontational in nature. This means that, as direct representation of the basic contradictions and major contradictions, many a specific contradiction in various fields is non-confrontational in nature. Nevertheless, some of them are confrontationa1. Main characteristics of the social contradictions of the new time: 1) contradictions of material interest are prominent, 2) periodical social contradictions are diverse and complicated. Parties involved in these social contradictions are complicated, and the components constituting these contradictions are complicated, too. Contradictions in economy, politics, ideology and culture are interwoven into one another. 3) the contradictions are apt to be intensified, resulting in abrupt group conflicts, which are actually on the increase but are internal contradictions among the people. Yet, if not handled promptly and effectively, they may be made use of by some hostile individuals, who may take the opportunity to stir up further hostility and bring about damage on the country. Contradictions of this type will then turn into confrontations between friends and enemies, which can, doubtlessly, affects social stability and hinder the implementation of the open policy and reform. In dealing with the contradictions of the new era, the basic principle we have to is the “three represents”. The idea of “three represents” put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin and the requirement for its implementation in the new era is based on the generalization and conclusion from the experience of the entire history of the Party, especially the fresh experience since the 3rd Session of the 11th Party congress. It is also based on the analysis of the great changes of the objective social context in which the Party lies and the new elements of which is composed. The “three represents” is both the requirement for our Party to maintain its progressive nature and the basic principle which it has to adhere to in dealing with the contradictions in the construction of economy, culture and the contradictions in various other fields. In order to maintain social stability and to continue to develop, there must be a stable environment, without which there will be no development. In dealing with social contradictions, the principle of stability of the first importance. We have to do our best to eliminate unstable factors, smooth away the affective mood of the masses, resolve group contradictions, avoid social conflicts, keep social order and harmony, and maintain social stability. We must also stick to the principle of being practical and realistic. To handle the social contradictions I a correct way, we have to be practical and realistic, and have a correct understanding of the nature of these contradictions; never should we confuse the two types of contradictions. Otherwise, we will not be able to find the right way to overcome these contradictions, and the Cause of the Party and the people will suffer great loss. What is more, we also have to stick to the principle of equality. In the process of dealing with social contradictions, the principle of the socialist equality requires that we treat various parties involved in the contradiction equally when we come to the coordination of disputed interest among the people. In drawing up and implementing these policies, we must stick to the principle of equality and outlaw social elites, so that everyone stands equal before the law. The best way to deal with social contradictions in the new era is, first of all, to promote production in a big way. Only by doing so can we accumulate enough material strength to guarantee the solution of various social contradictions, and the right solution of social contradictions Can, in turn, promote the development of social productivity. Secondly, we have to deepen our reform, which is to solve both the basic contradictions and specific contradictions in the socialist society. At the same time, we have to intensify social re-adjustment. We have to establish a complete set of rules and regulations on the basis of the realities of the market economy and according to the needs in resolving various social problems and social contradictions. At the moment, we have to consolidate our leading construction, overcome bureaucracy and pharisaism, and eradicate corruption. This is the only way to resolve the cadre-mass contradictions. The strategy of “running the country with morality”, has to be implemented at deep levels and, to maintain the stability of the country, morality and law have to be given equal amount of priority. We should never overlook the importance of morality. Instead, we must strengthen it by setting up a healthy moral standard that is fit for the socialist market economy in order to satisfy the moral needs of the people in the period of social transformation from the old system to the new one. This is also the need of the present reform in the development of the socialist market economy and in the handling of social contradictions. Therefore, in the new era, we have to pay particular attention to the construction of our moral standards. Chapter Four discusses the problems of corruption, China's entry into WT0, development of Internet, and their effect on the social contradictions in the new era. Some relative measures are suggested so as to further enhance the theory of the socialist social contradictions of the new era in China. Generally speaking, the entry into WTO provides us with favorable conditions to solve social contradictions of the new era. First, it can further promote the economy of our country, thus laying a solid material foundation for the solution of the present social contradictions. It is also beneficial for the reforming of the government institutions so as to increase the transparency of government administration and raise the efficiency of management. China's legal system will be more complete thereafter, and the force of re-adjustment will be further strengthened. But at the same time, the entry into WTO has further complicated the social contradictions of the new are, making solution of these contradictions more difficult. This can be seen in the following aspects: 1) Western countries are now making greater efforts to push forward their westernization strategy; 2) The security of the country’s economy, which includes the security of some key enterprise, strategic resources, finance and so on, is faced with new challenge. After the entry into WT0,unemployment will increase, income gap will be enlarged, and social contradictions and factors of unstability will grow. Western countries will carry out their cultural penetration to a greater extent. In order to avoid the intensification of contradictions, maintain social stability and guarantee the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics after the entry of WT0, we must stay cool-headed, upgrade the ability of the Party in power, follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics steadfastly and set up the national economic security system for the new era. Apart from economic means, a comprehensive use of political, military and scientific and technological means should also be used to safeguard the national economic security. We have to expand our economy, reduce unemployment, avoid unfairness in distribution, and eliminate the root of social contradictions. What is more, we have to be on guard against the invasion of the declination and corruption of the western culture, and to make our society more fit for the socialist culture to prosper. The rapid development of information revolution on the basis of Internet has greatly changed the mode of production and people's way of life. It has asserted increased influence on the political, economic activities of the country. The present social contradictions are, in a sense, the consequence of this Internet Age. To begin with, Internet is practical in nature, bearing the features of substance. It brings us not only material forms such as computers, database, broad bands, but also a particular pattern of practice and the Internet culture that follows. Secondly, Internet also bears some spiritual features, which is characterized by its virtuality Yet, the impact it has on reality is inevitable. With the coming of the information society, man is now able to break down his biological constraints, to show his initiative to affect the outside world, and to make his mind capable of influencing the society in an unprecedented way. The Internet has changed the nature of work, and guaranteed the autonomy of the cognitive subject and the validity of his judgement. The appearance of Internet has, in its virtual world, removed the obstacle of time and space. It has started a revolution in man's way of communication. While increasing its investment to encourage the construction of Internet and to push forward the informationalization of the society, the goven1ment has also adopted active measures to eliminate the harm that has already appeared, and has brought its management under the supervision of law. The development of Internet has produced negative effect upon the political life of our country. First, it has brought about new threats to the security of the country; Second, it is used by some as a channel to spread pornography, to engage in gambling, and to sell narcotic drugs; Third, the anarchy of the Internet management has stimulated and intensified social contradictions, resulting in the escalation of social conflicts. The overall influence caused by the development of Internet on the evolution of social contradictions requires that we take appropriate relative measures to eliminate or weaken its negative effects on the development of the society while enhancing its positive ones. We have to find out its intrinsic features by studying it from all the related perspectives. The strategy that we adopt has to be such that combines safeguarding with correct guidance. We must squarely face the impact on the administration and management of the society, speed up the construction of legal procedures, and lay a solid legal foundation for the healthy and orderly development of Internet",1026935264, 新时期社会矛盾研究,Dissertations & Theses," Guo, YueGuoYueGuo, Yue郭跃",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715134241 , 70606782 , 189128 , H411331 , H411331", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese, 新时期社会矛盾研究,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026935264?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAIH411331 , Philosophy, religion and theology , basic social contradiction , contradiction of different nature , major social contradiction , social contradiction , social stratification , 两类不同性质的矛盾 , 理论范式 , 社会基本矛盾 , 社会矛盾 , 阶级分析",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+Socia+Contradiction+of+the+New+Eya&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Guo%2C+Yue&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"3,"Private loss, public gain: Orphans in Malawi","In the twentieth century, concern with child welfare resulted in one of the fastest growing social movements in the West. From the establishment of the Save the Children Fund in the UK at the close of the First World War, to the setting up of United Nations Children's Fund following the Second, to the near universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, the child welfare movement has been marked by a concern with children internationally. In the last seventeen years, since the ratification of the convention, interest in the welfare of children in the developing world has grown dramatically. Children's welfare appeared in the 1997 UK Government white paper on international development, the World Bank suggested that child welfare was a useful development indicator, and large numbers of non-governmental-organisations were established (Boyden 1990). In Southern Africa, as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the close of the twentieth century saw increasing numbers of orphans appearing. As international concern regarding the social impacts of HIV/AIDS has risen, these orphans have become an issue of particular concern (Aspaas 1997). As a result of both the increasing interest in children's lives in general and the concern with orphans in particular, there are now a number of organisations specialising in orphan care (World Bank 2004, US Peace Corps 2004). These projects constitute a new social arena within which children live at least part of their daily lives. This thesis is an exploration of the social significance of four orphan-care projects functioning in Malawi. The analysis is made by looking at the identity of orphan as a social construct that has various uses, meanings and symbols attached to it and as a set of experiences that occur to children who have lost, through death, one or both of their parents.",1428819743,,Dissertations & Theses," Hutchinson, EleanorHutchinsonEleanorHutchinson, Eleanor",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3058695591 , 81305752 , 189128 , 9781303380822 , U592987 , U592987", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9781303380822, English, English,,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428819743?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy,, 0630 Public policy, Public policy," (UMI)AAIU592987 , Social sciences , Orphans",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Private+loss%2C+public+gain%3A+Orphans+in+Malawi&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hutchinson%2C+Eleanor&amp;isbn=9781303380822&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"4,"""From below and to the left"": Re-imagining the Chicano movement through the circulation of third world struggles, 1970-1979","Activists, artists, journalists, and intellectuals in the United States, from the 1950s to the present, have supported national liberation movements in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, arguing that anti-colonial struggles abroad were related to human and civil rights struggles in the United States. This dissertation builds on these foundations by tracing multi-racial and transnational connections among people and organizations in the United States, and between the United States and Latin America during the 1970s. Uncovering these connections that linked the Third World ""within"" to the Third World ""without"" across the Americas reconfigures the narrative of what happened to social movements in the 1970s, and helps us re-imagine the Chicano movement through the lens of an anti-colonial politics. This project bridges the local, national, and international terrains of political struggle by tracing the lives of activists and organizations in the United States and Latin America who defined their politics in relation to the Third World. It interrogates four inter-related themes: the prison rebellions in the United States, third world political activity in major U.S. urban centers, guerrilla theatre on both sides of the U.S-Mexican (and by extension Latin American) international border, and social movement connections between Texas and Mexico. My primary focus is on localized strategies for grassroots mobilizations rooted in working class cultural practices, multi-ethnic solidarities, and transnational political formations that were comprised of Chicano, Black, Asian, Puerto Rican, Mexican, American Indian, and white activists and artists. I also emphasize the local elements involved in the political alliances, coalitions, and solidarity efforts across geopolitical borders and different political perspectives. Overall, this project explores connections across, underneath, and outside the political, economic and cultural construction of the nation state, and the hemispheric construction of the Americas with the United States as the primary political, economic and cultural power. These intertwined perspectives simultaneously step back to interrogate the larger international connections while focusing in on local manifestations of national issues refracted through a hemispheric lens. It is in the 1970s - a decade characterized by a shift in the policies of the crisis-ridden political economy of the Keynesian welfare state in response to these very struggles - that we should locate the early elements of what is currently referred to the anti-globalization movements.",1524722390,,Dissertations & Theses," Gomez, Alan EladioGomezEladioAlanGomez, Alan Eladio",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3304471741 , 32566941 , 66569 , 9781303818691 , 3615778 , 3615778", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9781303818691, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1524722390?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," Latin American history , American history"," Social sciences , Borderlands , Chicana/o studies , Incarceration studies , Social movements , Theatre against empire , U.s. third world politics and revolution",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22From+below+and+to+the+left%22%3A+Re-imagining+the+Chicano+movement+through+the+circulation+of+third+world+struggles%2C+1970-1979&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gomez%2C+Alan+Eladio&amp;isbn=9781303818691&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"5,Life is treasure for everyone: actually emerging cosmopolitanism in the experiences of the okinawan peace movement participants,"This thesis attempts to analyse and explain the contemporary peace movements in Okinawa, the southernmost island area of Japan. This is an area where US bases and servicemen have caused various problems for more than half a century. Against this situation, active peace movements are going on in Okinawa, with their communication networks extended across national and regional boundaries. In the theoretical selection, recent discussions on the so-called ""global social movements"" are critically examined. It is pointed out that they tend to dismiss complexities of communications between different individuals involved with social movements. As a consequence, it is argued that this research can more properly be conducted under the framework of ""cosmopolitan social science"", which takes account of diverse experiences of individuals engaged with transnational communications. In the empirical section, various activities, experiences, and tactics of different individuals committed to the Okinawan peace movements are highlighted. The main issues of the movements include: US militarism; the environmental destruction caused by US bases; the military violence against women; the memory of the 1945 Battle of Okinawa; the ""ethnic"" claims of Okinawans as distinct form the Japanese Mainlanders; the ""tourist gaze"" of the Japanese Mainlanders on Okinawa, which dismisses social problems in Okinawa. Based on the above analysis, it is discussed that Okinawans' experiences of communications with the like-minded citizens on the Japanese Mainland and overseas have had a considerable effect of transforming their 'Okinawan identity"", which has conventionally been associated with their ""victim consciousness"" against the Japanese Mainlanders. In the other words, they have come to reframe their movements through a transnational perspective, in which case they need not, or should not, always be preoccupied with the ""victim consciousness"". This ""actually emerging cosmopolitanism"" among Okinawans reminds us that an analysis of social movements should have a careful look at social interactions between different individuals in the movements, rather than presupposing their collectivity.",301643019,,Dissertations & Theses," Iwasa, MasashiIwasaMasashiIwasa, Masashi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

An overview of the evolution of the political wing is established.  An evaluation of the functioning and effectiveness of the organizations, which identifies their internal problems, is followed by an investigation of the external factors which contributed to the marginalisation of the Occitan movement.  These include the geographical, historical, demographic and socio-linguistic factors which have differentiated the Occitan movement from other French ethnoregionalist movements, and made mobilization of the target audience difficult.  By taking a global view of Occitania, rather than focussing, like previous researchers, on Languedoc, the study highlights the extent to which such factors made the movement’s aims for political autonomy for the whole of the territory unrealistic.  The relative success of the movement in the mid 1970s resulted from the fact that for a period its aims were congruent with the wave of social movement activity in post-1968 France, but the association was not deep-seated.  In the 1980s and 1990s the effects of the decentralization reforms and the growth of the Front National had a negative effect on the movement’s mobilizational potential.  The issue of leadership, referred to briefly in previous studies, is subjected here to more detailed analysis, and is revealed as a significant factor in the weakness of political Occitanism.",301653206,,Dissertations & Theses," Ritson, S.E.RitsonS.E.Ritson, S.E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760786171 , 45134211 , 101309 , U220249 , U220249 , http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/1723/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301653206?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/1723/ , DN103739 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+Occitanism+1974-2000%3A+exploring+the+marginalisation+of+an+ethnoregionalist+movement.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ritson%2C+S.E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"9,Meaning in movement: an ideational analysis of Sheffield-based protest networks contesting globalisation and war.,"Since the late 1990s millions of people have been involved in political protest actions contesting globalisation and war.  The two issues are interconnected by the continuing involvement of many of the same individuals, organisations and networks making political claims in opposition to relevant institutional actors.  Social movements involved in these protests include a marked diversity of political worldviews. This thesis analyses the worldviews informing particular instantiations of those movements.  Social movements must be understood as continuous, dynamic processes which, at times, occur as large-scale public events.  Participants' political beliefs are formed, tested and reconstituted in continuous debate and action with their peers and opponents.  Meaning results from the interrelations between concepts in larger ideational structures.  Interpreting the worldviews presented by social movements therefore involves piecing together various ideational elements into reasonably coherent, interlocking structures that make sense of the statements and behaviour of social movement participants.  It is through extended participation within social movement groups that discursive processes can be observed.  An ethnographic methodology therefore forms the empirical basis on which this thesis develops an hermeneutic project that elucidates the meanings of social movements. The activities of Sheffield-based participants in movements contesting globalisation and war offer the opportunity for an ideational study grounded in everyday activities and discourse.  Three significant justificatory worldviews are identified: revolutionary socialism, direct action and radical liberalism.  Understanding these belief structures as overlapping, in conflict and in competition will be valuable in interpreting particular phases of contemporary movement activity.  The latter is demonstrated in detailed case studies of the anti-war and social forum movements.  These cases illuminate complex connections between the local and global spheres of social movement action, offering understanding of how beliefs identified at the local level reflect claims made by broader social movements.",301671305,,Dissertations & Theses," Gillan, K.GillanK.Gillan, K.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760784491 , 45134071 , 101309 , U218644 , U218644", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301671305?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN105400 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Meaning+in+movement%3A+an+ideational+analysis+of+Sheffield-based+protest+networks+contesting+globalisation+and+war.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gillan%2C+K.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"10,"""Challenging &lt;i&gt;Machismo&lt;/i&gt;"": the influence of the Mexican feminist movement on sexual and domestic violence legislation and public policies","At the heart of the diversity of definitions of social movements lies the notion that these are collectives of individuals who act in order to bring about social transformations.  However, systematic studies on the influence of social movements on the political system are still scarce. Authors who have worked on the outcomes or influence of social movements (Huberts, 1989; Giugni, 1995) have referred to the theoretical and methodological difficulties that a study of this kind entails.  This thesis shows that it is possible to appraise the influence of a social movement on legislation and public policies if a detailed process of investigation is carried out.  Nancy Fraser's conceptualization of the three-step process involved in the satisfaction of needs has contributed significantly to this investigation.  This research examined four legal reforms and a public policy on gender violence in order to understand how and to what extent Mexican feminist movements have influenced them and to know which of the facilitating factors were. The first set of findings shows that in all of the five cases studied there are indications of state policy being influenced by the feminist movements.  The second demonstrates that legal reforms and public policies, which occurred in the state, were possible only after long actions, which had been undertaken in two arenas: the civil society and the state.  The third suggests that among the facilitating factors were: presence of women in pivotal political positions; alliances established among women from different sectors, and with leftist political forces; ad hoc alliances with authorities; more plurality in government; and the emergence of a women-friendly international context.",301698825,,Dissertations & Theses," Suárez López, M.S. del R.Suárez Lópezdel R.M.S.Suárez López, M.S. del R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761407101 , 45134171 , 101309 , U235388 , U235388", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301698825?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN113956 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Challenging+Machismo%22%3A+the+influence+of+the+Mexican+feminist+movement+on+sexual+and+domestic+violence+legislation+and+public+policies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Su%C3%A1rez+L%C3%B3pez%2C+M.S.+del+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"11,Altering world order: the alter-globalization movement and the world trade organization,"This thesis analyses the relationship between the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the alter-globalization movement through the theoretical framework of Robert W. Cox. A Coxian perspective highlights that the WTO is a central international organization of the current nebuleuse, and one integral to enforcing, promoting and defending transnational corporate hegemony. The emergence of the protest movement inaccurately labelled the ‘anti-globalization movement’ can be described as a Coxian counter-hegemonic structure. From the plethora of protesters making up this ‘anti-globalization movement’ who dispute the legitimacy of the WTO, a distinct alter-globalization movement can be identified. It prescribes the alternative principles of public accountability, the rights of people and the protection of the environment as guides to reforming the WTO towards a Coxian ‘new multilateralism’. This thesis asks: to what extent has this alter-globalisation movement succeeded in altering the policies and processes of the WTO in accordance with these principles? In Coxian terms the questions of how far the campaign for ‘new multilateralism’ has successfully altered the hegemony of the current world order and avoided trasformismo are asserted. After illustrating corporate structural power within the WTO’s policies and procedures, the alter-globalisation movement is defined as an entity of overlapping social movements and Non-Governmental Organizations (Alter-NGOs). The thesis identifies and evaluates three strategies employed by the alter-globalisation movement to place its values at the heart of the WTO: demonstrations on the street; assisting developing states during negotiations; and submitting amicus briefs to the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The obstacles presented by the WTO’s policy of trasformismo are then detailed, namely: political elites coopting the alter-globalization movement’s principles into their own rhetoric; the cooption of NGOs by political elites from the developing world, and the cooption of NGOs and the fierce rejection of any NGO influence within the WTO. In its conclusions the thesis details the manner in which trasformismo is a significant tool in the armoury of corporate hegemony for resisting reform, and thereby informs existing literature on the problems faced by all social movements and NGOs engaging with reforming the world order.",301704769,,Dissertations & Theses," Paterson, William B.PatersonB.WilliamPaterson, William B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760975691 , 45164331 , 101309 , U233223 , U233223 , http://hdl.handle.net/1893/186", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301704769?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://hdl.handle.net/1893/186 , DXN112800 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Altering+world+order%3A+the+alter-globalization+movement+and+the+world+trade+organization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paterson%2C+William+B.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"12,"Horizontality and the political economy of social movement: the anti-capitalist globalisation movement, the Karnataka State Farmers' Association and dynamics of social transformation in rural South India","This thesis analyses how dynamics of social transformation are affected by social movement and structural change.  Countering reductive accounts of globalisation and anti-globalisation, it moves from i) the macro-level activities of the Karnataka State Farmers' Association (KRRS), and the anti-capitalist globalisation movement (ACGM) to ii) the micro-level of the KRRS's social bases where dynamics of domination and resistance are empirically evaluated.  As opposed to the discourse of horizontal social movement practice advanced by new social movement theory, the global justice movement literature and discourse of the KRRS and the ACGM, which holds that cross-class cross-caste collective action by the KRRS in rural Karnataka has been democratically organised mass action against all forms of domination, the thesis illustrates the persistence of 'vertical' politics between social movements, and inequalities of class, caste and gender within social movements. Transnational networks are dominated by a cyber-connected few, whilst the KRRS is dominated by village elites who have largely abandoned collective action for individualised strategies of accumulation.  In a context of the declining centrality of agriculture to the material reproduction of rural households and increasing levels of micro-level political institutionalisation, village elites have joined forces with their erstwhile opponents in the local state, as part of a 'shadow state' that is central to the allocation of structural change's impact.  The thesis finds that the KRRS's involvement in transnational networks has had no relevance for marginalised social groups. Self-action, the capacity of social movement to act upon dominations within , is not possible in a highly unequal agrarian setting.  As opposed to the process of 'trickle-down solidarity' wrought by the KRRS leaders and its transnational allies, the thesis explores the possibility of transformative social movement networks led by marginalised social groups.  Three key variables are identified in this regard: material independence from village elites, self-organisation and external support.",301727450,,Dissertations & Theses," Pattenden, J.

Unlike other ethnoregionalist movements in France, it has been subject to little academic research. A study was made of documentary sources, including the internal bulletins of the political organizations and their published journals, which made possible a micro-level perspective on the movement, and revealed some inaccuracies of interpretation by previous researchers. An overview of the evolution of the political wing is established. An evaluation of the functioning and effectiveness of the organizations, which identifies their internal problems, is followed by an investigation of the external factors which contributed to the marginalisation of the Occitan movement. These include the geographical, historical, demographic and socio-linguistic factors which have differentiated the Occitan movement from other French ethnoregionalist movements, and made mobilization of the target audience difficult. By taking a global view of Occitania, rather than focussing, like previous researchers, on Languedoc, the study highlights the extent to which such factors made the movement's aims for political autonomy for the whole of the territory unrealistic. The relative success of the movement in the mid 1970s resulted from the fact that for a period its aims were congruent with the wave of social movement activity in post-1968 France, but the association was not deep-seated. In the 1980s and 1990s the effects of the decentralization reforms and the growth of the Front National had a negative effect on the movement's mobilizational potential. The issue of leadership, referred to briefly in previous studies, is subjected here to more detailed analysis, and is revealed as a significant factor in the weakness of political Occitanism.",304905954,,Dissertations & Theses," Ritson, Sandra ElizabethRitsonElizabethSandraRitson, Sandra Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1314047871 , 36527761 , 66569 , C826358 , C826358", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304905954?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science",," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science"," European history , History , Political science"," Social sciences , Ethnoregionalist , France , Marginalization , Occitanism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+Occitanism%2C+1974%E2%80%932000%3A+Exploring+the+marginalisation+of+an+ethnoregionalist+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ritson%2C+Sandra+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"14,"In the vanguard of history: The Beijing Democracy Wall Movement, 1978–1981, and social mobilisation of former Red Guard dissent","The thesis employs the new social movement approach to explain and analyse the Beijing Democracy Wall Movement 1978--81. Earlier Western research has largely neglected the movement-side of the Democracy Wall Movement and concentrated on the issue of democracy in its argumentation. The new approach helps to clarify confusions both about the historical nature of this movement and the protest it presented. The Movement was intellectually and generation-wise based on the Cultural Revolution and the radical socialist democratic ideas of the Red Guards developed during it. The Movement's activists offered their ideas on democratic reforms as their contribution to Marxism and were therefore connected to international Marxist revisionism of the time. Only a small minority of the activists used non- or anti-Marxist arguments in their defence of democracy. On the level of collective identities the Movement was portrayed as the movement of the political aware youth assuming the vanguard position in the revolution and the struggle against the 'feudal fascist dictatorship' of the Leftist Party bureaucrats. Connected to this, the identities of socialist citizens using their legal rights and enlighteners of the people were also used to justify the movement. These identities draw heavily on the collective repertoire known to the activists on social movements of the past in China, as well as the Communist lore of the continuing revolution, but they also represented innovation in the notion of permanent democratic activism under socialism. The way the collective and individual activist identities were framed also helped to keep the otherwise fractured and loose movement together. The thesis also shows that at least for the Democracy Wall Movement there was more continuity with the Cultural Revolution and discontinuity with the later phases of the post-Mao Chinese Democracy Movement than earlier has been suggested.",304906203,,Dissertations & Theses," Paltemaa, LauriPaltemaaLauriPaltemaa, Lauri",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1380048651 , 37538981 , 66569 , 9789512929764 , C827970 , C827970", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9789512929764, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304906203?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," History , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Beijing , China , Cultural Revolution , Democracy Wall Movement , Dissent , Red Guard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+the+vanguard+of+history%3A++The+Beijing+Democracy+Wall+Movement%2C+1978%E2%80%931981%2C+and+social+mobilisation+of+former+Red+Guard+dissent&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paltemaa%2C+Lauri&amp;isbn=9789512929764&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"15,Youth against fascism: The construction of communist youth identity in Britain and the United States,"Communism framed itself as a rebellion against the past and a vanguard of modernity, consciously shaping the present forces of history to achieve a ""proscibed"" future. In this process communists placed great emphasis upon the role of the youth. Young Communist Leagues were established to politicize youth and train them in Marxist-Leninist ideology. Communists contended that such ""correct"" political education would enable young people to ""construct"" a socialist future. Though communists emphasized youth, traditional historical narratives have neglected this theme. Communist historiography has been dominated by an emphasis upon the role of Moscow and the Communist International; ""traditionalist"" narratives emphasize Moscow domination while ""revisionist"" histories distance national parties from the Comintern. While revealing important elements of communist history, such a dichotomy distorts the dynamics of communism as both a national and international movement. Communism was consciously a highly centralized international movement that had to function in distinct national contexts and political cultures. Communists actively identified with and were directed by the Comintern, implementing their national tactics within the limited political space accorded to them. Though initially boastful of this relationship, western communists later distanced themselves from the Comintern in their Popular Front propaganda, consciously distorting the nature of this relationship in the public mind. This premise should not be an area of contention, but should enable scholars to ""move on"" and explore other diverse elements and themes of communist history. This research explores the evolution of the communist youth movement in Britain and the United States through the medium of political propaganda. Propaganda was the primary method utilized by communists to transmit political values to their membership. Such sources offer an invaluable resource in tracing the evolution of communist identity and the diverse strategies employed to ""attract"" youth. This research identifies the existence of two distinct political generations; the ""Leninist Generation"" of the twenties who defined their movement in negation to social democracy and the ""Popular Front Generation"" of the thirties, defining their movement as the antithesis of fascism. Tracing the development of this phenomenon in a trans-Atlantic context, this research explores how young people understood communism by studying the ""ideal"" political identity communists sought to construct in two generations of British and American youth.",304907470,,Dissertations & Theses," Lewis, Joel A.LewisA.JoelLewis, Joel A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1268600101 , 35499521 , 66569 , 9780542935923 , 3239345 , 3239345", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542935923, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304907470?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science",," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History , 0615 Political science"," European history , American history , History , Political science"," Social sciences , Britain , Communist , Fascism , Identity , United States , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Youth+against+fascism%3A+The+construction+of+communist+youth+identity+in+Britain+and+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lewis%2C+Joel+A.&amp;isbn=9780542935923&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"16,Communicating co-ops in a wired world: How the International Co-operative Movement can promote itself in the Information Age,"The International Co-operative Movement is comprised of 800 million people in 100 countries around the world, yet despite its size and obvious success the movement continues to suffer from an identity crisis.

Using social movement and ""new media"" communication theories in an extended literature review, this paper begins the process of looking for reasons why the 160 year old movement has slipped out of view. The paper concludes that the International Co-operative Movement's loss of identity is closely related to the loss of its once-strong education and social movement activities, both of which relied on effective communication. It also concludes that the Internet holds promise as a strategic communication tool for a movement that MacPherson (2005, p. 49) claims has ""missed every communication revolution since the pamphlet.""",304915161,,Dissertations & Theses," Pullinger, JanPullingerJanPullinger, Jan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251888861 , 34108511 , 66569 , 9780494205723 , MR20572 , MR20572", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494205723, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304915161?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media,, 0708 Mass media, Mass media, Communication and the arts,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communicating+co-ops+in+a+wired+world%3A+How+the+International+Co-operative+Movement+can+promote+itself+in+the+Information+Age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pullinger%2C+Jan&amp;isbn=9780494205723&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"17,"Institutional contexts and the geography of collaboration in transnational social movement organizations, 1980–2000","Since the late 1980s, governments around the world have intensified their efforts to formalize regional relationships. The European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are but three examples of the diversity of regional systems that have ascended to prominence in the contemporary world. These systems are enmeshed with the broader institutional dynamics of political and economic globalization and are integral components of the world polity. Within sociology, however, their development and their impact on various forms of social relations have been much neglected. Taking regions as analytic sites, this dissertation advances scholarship on the relationship between institutionalized power relations in the actors. I address two related questions in this dissertation: (1) What are the effects of regionalism on the organization of transnational collective action? (2) How do global and regional institutional processes interrelate to impact the geography of transnational social movement coalitions and networks? Using data collected from an annual census of international organizations, I examined the main questions of the dissertation in the following steps: I analyzed and compared the development of regionally organized transnational social movement organizational sectors in relation to the institutional contexts of regionalism; employing network analysis, I analyzed the geographic structure of the world network formed through shared membership in transnational social movement organizations (TSMOs) that had global membership; and I compared geographic patterns of co-participation in regional and global human rights and development TSMOs and assessed the extent to which global and regional network processes can be understood as mutually reinforcing. I found the following: (1) Regionalism supports the emergence of transnational activist networks and coalitions worldwide; (2) Inter-state conflict and cooperation within regions impacts the geography of global activists networks; (3) Global network dynamics influence the development of regional movement sectors.

Kenyan commoners' world historic struggles provide critical examples for activists, scholars, commoners and others, of the reconstruction and defense of a life-centred subsistence political economy. The dynamics of popular struggles for the gendered commons in Kenya between 1870 and 2007 are traced through an analysis of fifteen instances of struggle, including short lived uprisings and long-term social movements. Special attention is paid to the gendered and ethnicized class character of Kenyan social movements and to the subsistence content of the relationships being wrought in the process of 'globalization from below.' This approach reveals: (1) the ways in which Kenyan peasant women have contributed to the mobilization of social movements for subsistence over the long twentieth century; (2) the ways 'gendered class alliances' and the creative amalgams of indigenous and exogenous 'social forms,' developed and used in the course of struggle, have been able to break the 'male deals' that channeled the fruits of Kenyans' fertility into the commodified marketplace, and (3) the potential of the subsistence-oriented demands of 21 st century Kenyan social movements for strengthening Kenyan and global movements for the gendered commons.",304929701,,Dissertations & Theses," Brownhill, LeighBrownhillLeighBrownhill, Leigh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1264612951 , 34415851 , 66569 , 9780494217597 , NR21759 , NR21759", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494217597, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304929701?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies"," African history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Commons , Food , Freedom , Gendered , Kenya , Land , Peasant , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Land%2C+food%2C+freedom%3A+Struggles+for+the+gendered+commons+in+Kenya%2C+1870+to+2007&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brownhill%2C+Leigh&amp;isbn=9780494217597&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"19,The post-process movement in rhetoric and composition: A philosophical hermeneutic reading of being -in -the -world with others,"This dissertation spotlights and articulates, in a philosophical hermeneutic framework, the emerging intellectual discourse of the post-process movement in rhetoric and composition studies. It provides a clarifying hermeneutic reading of post-process theory, according to the potential it holds for compositionists, researchers and writing practitioners who teach or write about composition courses. The study stimulates new thinking on post-process theory, while solidifying the intellectual traditions that underscore its assumptions, toward the goal of understanding what it means to write and the pedagogical ramifications of this understanding. Philosophical hermeneutics is used as a viable and desirable methodology of discovering, clarifying, enlightening and voicing the intellectual foundations and the ontological implications of perceiving writing as a public, interpretive, and situated act. Chapter one underlines the divergent strands of the post-process movement, intending to delineate the purpose and significance of exploring the assumptions of the movement for the field of composition. Chapter two situates post-process theory within the cultural narratives of its antecedents in rhetoric and composition, while featuring two main intellectual forces: (1) The current-traditional rhetoric of the 1960s, and (2) The process movement of the 1970s and 1980s. Chapter three provides an overview of 'the social turn', with its pedagogical manifestation in social constructionism and social epistemicism, in relation to the discourse of post-process theory. Chapter four focuses on the intellectual legacy on which post-process theory has built its assumptions, showing its rootedness in the philosophy of Sophism and the rhetoric of paralogy, which integrates Donald Davidson's philosophy of externalism. Chapter five applies Heidegger and Gadamer's hermeneutic concepts to post-process theory, aiming at offering an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of what philosophical hermeneutics can tell us about the nature of post-process writing, and the implications of this understanding for the teaching of writing. Chapter five ends with a pedagogical vision of post-process theory, pointing out the importance of viewing writing as a human value and a mode of existence and inquiry. The last section of the dissertation, Theory-into-Practice , brings a global perspective to the teaching of post-process writing and a responsibility to teaching for a better world.",304950587,,Dissertations & Theses," Elgeddawy, Mohamed Abdel Rahim MohamedElgeddawyAbdel Rahim MohamedMohamedElgeddawy, Mohamed Abdel Rahim Mohamed",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1095466441 , 32569971 , 66569 , 9780542553363 , 0542553368 , 3206643 , 3206643", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542553363 , 0542553368", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304950587?accountid=14496," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Rhetoric , Composition"," Language, literature and linguistics , Being-in-the-world , Philosophical hermeneutic , Postprocess movement , Rhetoric and composition",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+post-process+movement+in+rhetoric+and+composition%3A++A+philosophical+hermeneutic+reading+of+being+-in+-the+-world+with+others&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elgeddawy%2C+Mohamed+Abdel+Rahim+Mohamed&amp;isbn=9780542553363&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"20,The Cofán experiment: Expanding an indigenous Amazonian world,"This dissertation explores the practice of political mobilization in the global age. Its central characters are citizens of Ecuador who identify as Cofán, an ethno-linguistic group whose territory spans the Andean foothills and Amazonian rainforest of the Ecuadorian-Colombian border region. Over the past forty years, Cofán people have become entangled in a set of social and ecological relations that threatens their ability to live by the values that give meaning to their lives. In response to the dangers of territorial dispossession, large-scale deforestation, oil industry contamination, and the violence of Colombia's civil war and drug trade, the Cofán are negotiating a process of social change that one of their leaders has named ""the Cofán experiment."" This experiment in social transformation aims to expand the Cofán way of life to include an urban nongovernmental organization (NGO), scientific conservation partnerships with foreign institutions, and schooling situations intended to produce globally capable political leaders. By reworking their society in this way, Cofán people hope to maintain a valued existence in an increasingly threatening world. I investigate this instance of indigenous political mobilization through ethnographic analysis of Cofán action in the lowland community of Zábalo and Ecuador's national capital Quito, where a small group of Cofán individuals engage in political and educational activities. By combining a people- and place-based ethnography with a more expansive tracking of transnational, intercultural relations, I argue that Cofán actors constitute the meaning of global political work against the practical background of knowledge, activity, and value that continues to structure social life in Cofán communities.

German social democracy and the idea of Europe: Recasting socialist internationalism, 1900–1930","This dissertation explores a notion of ""Europe"" that arose within wartime and early interwar German social democracy and spread throughout the European socialist movement. This multifaceted European vision was the product of the breakdown and subsequent reconstruction of socialist internationalism. August 1914 marks the collapse of internationalism, which was attributed to the betrayal of the German Social Democratic Party. After this date the international movement was irreconcilably split in stark contrast to the perception of prewar internationalism. Europe came to symbolize the positive remnant of this lost internationalism: solidarity, optimism and above all confidence in the European path to modernity and socialism. The Great War not only exposed Europe's waning geopolitical significance but plunged orthodox Marxists into an existential crisis by calling this ''path'' into question. The Russian Revolution challenged the notion that history proceeded according to clearly defined successive stages. The Anglo-American powers seemed to demonstrate that capitalism after all might not contain within itself the seeds of its own destruction. The result was a social democratic ""internationalism"" inextricably bound to the idea of Europe, which constituted itself in conscious opposition to non-European forms of internationalism. Europe was after all the homeland and, it seemed increasingly so, the last bastion of social democracy. As such, ""European"" came to denote the existence of a powerful, class conscious and above all social democratic labor movement. Thus the decline of the ""West"" meant the marginalization and ultimate destruction of Europe's most important invention: socialism and democracy, or Marxist social democracy. A host of social democratic third way visions coalesced in the notion of Europe; Europe was located between Anglo-America and Russia as its social democratic ideology was not only situated between capitalism and communism but also between radicalism and reformism; Europe promised peace. Europe transcended the nation-state yet maintained a sense of cultural identity. By embracing Europe, social democracy became a defensive creed---defending the original model of Marxian socialism as it had developed in Central Europe under the tutelage of the German Social Democratic Party and offered a common political tradition to the continent.",304955252,,Dissertations & Theses," Maync, Tania M.MayncM.TaniaMaync, Tania M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1095442411 , 33063411 , 66569 , 9780542549816 , 0542549816 , 3206336 , 3206336", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542549816 , 0542549816", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304955252?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History",," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," European history , History"," Social sciences , Europe , German , Interwar period , Social democracy , Socialist internationalism , World War I",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=For+a+socialist+Europe%21+German+social+democracy+and+the+idea%0Aof+Europe%3A++Recasting+socialist+internationalism%2C+1900%E2%80%931930&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maync%2C+Tania+M.&amp;isbn=9780542549816&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"22,"The Early Music movement in the Netherlands: History, pedagogy and ethnography","This dissertation is a study of the historical performance movement in the Netherlands, examining how this tiny country became so prominent in the global Early Music community. The approach combines historical research with ethnography, and builds upon fieldwork conducted in the Netherlands among students, faculty and administrators at the Early Music Department of a major Dutch conservatory. The Department acts as a nexus of activity within the Early Music movement, wherein can be observed the interactions between established musicians, young professionals, and students. Of central importance is the relationship of students and teachers with composers, musical works, and historical treatises. To situate this institution within a broader historical and socioeconomic framework, I have connected the growth in the Early Music movement to the Dutch Bach revival at the beginning of the twentieth century, the development of the social welfare state, and Dutch policies towards the subsidization of the arts and arts education. Also examined in this regard is Early Music's close relationship with other musical genres, especially the Classical music mainstream, jazz and contemporary music. The economic efficiency, commercial success and international reputation of Dutch Early Music ensembles have had a transformative effect on the Netherlands' musical life.",304958776,,Dissertations & Theses," Rubinoff, Kailan RuthRubinoffRuthKailanRubinoff, Kailan Ruth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1147182701 , 33794571 , 66569 , 9780494140345 , NR14034 , NR14034", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494140345, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304958776?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education"," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education"," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education",," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education"," Music , Music education"," Communication and the arts , Education , Early Music movement , Netherlands , Pedagogy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Early+Music+movement+in+the+Netherlands%3A++History%2C+pedagogy+and+ethnography&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rubinoff%2C+Kailan+Ruth&amp;isbn=9780494140345&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"23,"Cross -Pacific dimensions of race, caste and *class: Meiji -era Japanese immigrants in the North American West, 1885–1928","This dissertation places Meiji-era Japanese immigration to the United States and Canada in both comparative and transnational perspective. It focuses on ways in which the immigrants' own understandings of race, caste and class informed their responses to the different categories of exclusion imposed under U.S. and Canadian law, and considers how immigrants who structured their own understanding of social difference in terms of caste and class participated in and tried to shape definitions of race and nation. At the center of a complex cross-Pacific dialogue, Meiji immigrants in North America simultaneously engaged in conversations about the meanings of race and class both with members of the dominant white society and with critics of emigration in Japan. In addition to providing an interpretive framework for the hostility they encountered in North America, cultural attitudes rooted in Tokugawa-era social categories helped to shape the responses of Japanese immigrants both to white racism and to employment opportunities in Canada and the United States. White racism was offensive to Japanese not only because it relegated them to the bottom of North America's labor hierarchies, but because it failed to maintain class- and caste- based distinctions they continued to regard as meaningful. Traditional social biases also informed the discursive strategies of Meiji officials, ultimately helping to reproduce the Japanese as an excludable category. Japanese tried to counter the impact of white racism by turning the language of race back on North Americans and emphasizing the asserted homogeneity of their own communities. Written into the historiography of Japanese immigration, reliance on the discourse of homogeneity has helped to mask the complexity and diversity of pre-war Japanese immigrant communities. It has also obscured the extent to which migration and relocation offered descendants of former outcaste groups in Japan a chance to transform their status. This dissertation argues for the importance of taking cultural perceptions of class and caste difference into account in studying Japanese immigration. It also complicates and deepens a broader history of racialization and transnational movement by exploring ways in which race, class and caste structured the perceptions and strategies of immigrant, sending and receiving communities alike.",304961668,,Dissertations & Theses," Geiger, Andrea A.

I focus my study on the discursive strategies employed by leaders of the movement to establish green chemistry and to develop and institute changes in the practice of the chemical sciences. The study looks specifically at three different strategies. The first is the construction of a historical narrative. This history comes from the intersection of the chemical sciences with environmentalism in the United States retold to place chemistry in a central position for understanding global environmental health issues and green chemistry as the natural response to these problems. The second involves the attempts made to develop a concrete definition for green chemistry as well as a set of guiding principles for the practice of this alternative form of chemistry. The establishment of the definition and the principles, I argue, constitutes an important move in constituting the field as a very specific interdisciplinary group with a forged identity and the beginnings of a system for determining what properly ‘counts’ as green chemistry. The third comes from the intersection of this history within the defining principles of the movement intersect to create a specific set of green chemistry practices, and how these practices manifest themselves in conference and pedagogical settings. Finally, I offer an overview of where the movement currently stands, offering a critical perspective on the future potential of the field. I argue that recent episodes indicate that the movement has not succeeded in accomplishing what it set out to do, and will continue to encounter problems unless a refashioning of the movement takes place. To offer perspective on green chemistry as a movement, I examine it through the lens of other (e.g., Frickel and Gross 2005) attempts to explore scientific movements as a special class of social movements.",304962703,,Dissertations & Theses," Roberts, Jody A.RobertsA.JodyRoberts, Jody A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1679669051 , 42537271 , 66569 , 9781109031812 , 3347624 , 3347624", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9781109031812, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304962703?accountid=14496," 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure , 0768 Environmental science"," 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure , 0768 Environmental science"," 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure , 0768 Environmental science",," 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure , 0768 Environmental science"," Science history , Social structure , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Chemistry studies , Disciplining , Discursive , Discursive strategies , Green chemistry , Scientific movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creating+green+chemistry%3A++Discursive+strategies+of+a+scientific+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roberts%2C+Jody+A.&amp;isbn=9781109031812&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"25,"Art Nouveau as social art: The modern democratic aesthetic of Parisian worker housing, 1894–1914","Parisian Art Nouveau, the local expression of an international movement in architecture and design between 1890 and 1914, ideologically and chronologically coincided with groundbreaking legislation to create low-income housing. While the bulk of classic twentieth-century architectural history addresses Art Nouveau as an elite, sinuous art form, this paper highlights, by contrast, its profound social consciousness. Holistic design, structural rationalism, and functionality characterized the restrained, consciously modern aesthetic. Art nouveau and art social , used interchangeably, signified the goals of reform, education, and equality, in theoretical opposition to ""art for art's sake."" Because the architectural center suffered the hygienic and housing crisis acutely, Paris was the nexus of debate and experiment surrounding the moral implications and definition of the new typology. Through organizations such as the International Society for Popular Art and Hygiene and the leadership of theorists Roger Marx, Henri Cazalis, and Frantz Jourdain, architects embraced worker housing as one means of fostering ""art in everything, everywhere, and for everyone."" The domestic environment became the symbol of rational identity and an index of well-being, denoting in turn French insecurity in a competitive European marketplace; the struggle to redefine values and strengths in the face of modernity; and the desire to reassert Paris as the international arbiter of the avant-garde. Art Nouveau attempted to reconcile the extremes of paternalism, eugenics, and socialism. Housing was at once a control mechanism and a tool to uplift and educate the masses. This paper demonstrates how the philanthropic Worker Housing Group and 1903 Housing Exhibition exemplified the tension between theory and practice in the effort to infuse social ideals into modern architecture. Although Art Nouveau failed to disseminate affordable art to all, its architects were among the first to address the imperative of economical, standardized, hygienic worker housing, as broadly applied in habitations à bon marché and garden city construction into the inter-war period.",304964823,,Dissertations & Theses," Liverman, Astrid Marguerite BybeeLivermanMarguerite BybeeAstridLiverman, Astrid Marguerite Bybee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251838931 , 34018681 , 66569 , 9780542923630 , 3238139 , 3238139", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542923630, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304964823?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0729 Architecture",," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0729 Architecture"," Art history , Design , Interior design , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Art Nouveau , Cazalis, Henri , Democratic aesthetic , France , Frantz Jourdain , Henri Cazalis , Jourdain, Frantz , Marx, Roger , Parisian , Roger Marx , Social art , Worker housing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Art+Nouveau+as+social+art%3A++The+modern+democratic+aesthetic%0Aof+Parisian+worker+housing%2C+1894%E2%80%931914&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liverman%2C+Astrid+Marguerite+Bybee&amp;isbn=9780542923630&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"26,The challenge of organization: Anarchist and Marxist politics since the First International,"My investigation deploys a genealogical analysis of the relationship between Marxist and anarchist theories of organization, by locating the most profound and deep-seated antagonisms and similarities between these traditions.

I show that despite their cleavages, current Marxist and anarchist movements contain the capacity to strengthen their bonds of solidarity and maintain sustainable alliances and coalitions. I argue that both Marxists and anarchists must accept a plural definition of 'democracy'---described here as a complex system that attempts to create mechanisms in which the maximum number of persons affected by a decision can participate in the process of orchestrating organizational goals and strategies---if these traditions are to effectively work together and create a viable socialist alternative to global capitalism.",304965028,,Dissertations & Theses," Stevens, AndrewStevensAndrewStevens, Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1166579701 , 34159951 , 66569 , 9780494154298 , MR15429 , MR15429", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494154298, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304965028?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science",," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," Social research , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+challenge+of+organization%3A+Anarchist+and+Marxist+politics+since+the+First+International&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stevens%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9780494154298&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"27,"The importance of social movements' networks in development communication: Lessons from the Zapatista Movement in Chiapas, Mexico","This dissertation proposes an analytical framework to examine social movements' networks from the perspective of development communication theory combined with relevant concepts from new social movements' literature. The research places the discussion of social movements' networks and their impact in economic and social development in the context of Latin America. In particular, it draws upon the experiences of the Zapatista Movement in Chiapas, Mexico, to illustrate the way in which the actors that formed the Zapatista solidarity network are collaborating and working together with the movement's members to improve the lives of the indigenous communities in the region. The SRF analytical framework explores social movements' networks from three different, although deeply interrelated, analytical dimensions: the structure of the networks, the resources that flow within the network and the impact they have in development, and the factors at the local, national, and international levels that influence what these networks can accomplish in their pursuit of social change. This framework is put into perspective using the experiences of the Zapatista Movement in Chiapas, Mexico. Understanding the impact of social movements' networks in development from these three analytical dimensions is imperative for furthering our knowledge about the role of communication in the process of social change in Latin America today.",304970192,,Dissertations & Theses," Garrido, Maria I.GarridoI.MariaGarrido, Maria I.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1196415981 , 34417611 , 66569 , 9780542769443 , 3224221 , 3224221", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542769443, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304970192?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Mass media , International law , International relations"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Chiapas , Development communication , Mexico , Networks , Social movements , Zapatista Movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+importance+of+social+movements%27+networks+in+development+communication%3A+Lessons+from+the+Zapatista+Movement+in+Chiapas%2C+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garrido%2C+Maria+I.&amp;isbn=9780542769443&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"28,"Producing justice: Fair trade coffee, livelihoods and the environment","Producing Justice: Fair Trade Coffee, Sustainability and Survival looks at the social, economic and environmental benefits of fair trade for the small farmers who participate in this fast-growing alternative market system. Based on extensive ethnographic and survey research in Zapotec indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico, Producing Justice follows the members of the cooperative Michiza, whose organic coffee is sold on the international fair trade market, as well as conventional farming families in the same remote villages who are dependent on local middlemen and the fluctuations of the world coffee market. The study finds that fair trade does indeed deliver many of the social, economic and environmental benefits to participants and their families that are touted by the movement. Compared with their conventional neighbors, Michiza member families are more food secure, less indebted, have higher gross incomes, engage in more environmentally beneficial organic coffee farming methods, generate more paid work for local people, and are more likely to continue growing coffee rather than abandoning or razing their shade coffee plots. However, fair trade does not bring the majority of participants out of poverty. In many cases, the fair trade minimum prices do not even cover farmers' costs of production. The dissertation also explores critically the politics of the international fair trade movement. Drawing on dozens of interviews with fair trade leaders, it examines the relationship between alternative markets such as fair trade and the dynamics of the global market. Producing Justice looks at new challenges to fair trade posed by large corporate retailers who have recently entered the system, and discusses the relationship between fair trade and broader movements for global economic justice.

Yet how substantial is diasporic involvement in global development processes? And what are the possible consequences---both positive and negative---of such participation? This dissertation examines such questions through a series of theoretical discussions of the concepts of diaspora, development, and displacement, and with particular emphasis on an illustrative case study: luxury condominium developments on the fringes of the Indian metropolis of Kolkata. These new housing projects are built and marketed with a self-consciously global aesthetic in mind and are actively promoted towards both overseas Indian communities and local elites as spaces in which one can embody a transnational, cosmopolitan, modern, and quintessentially urban lifestyle. They are also part of a broader urban and cultural project intended to help Kolkata regain its past glory as a 'world city.' Drawing on an array of archival sources, cultural texts, and fieldwork in Kolkata as well as in Canada, this dissertation examines the evidence, the impact, and the potential of such diaspora-influenced housing development projects. The central argument of the dissertation is that the actual participation of diasporas in a range of development practices---from sending remittances to making investments to purchasing property---is secondary to their symbolic importance. It is the idea of the diaspora---and a monolithic conceptualization at that---which is crucial for mobilizing key actors and constituting material transformations in the post-colonial city.",304982097,,Dissertations & Theses," Bose, Pablo ShiladityaBoseShiladityaPabloBose, Pablo Shiladitya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251837401 , 32709801 , 66569 , 9780494197691 , NR19769 , NR19769", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494197691, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304982097?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Diasporic , India , Kolkata , Peri-urban transformations , Transnational , Urban transformations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Towards+a+global+city+of+joy%3A++Diasporic+transnational+practices+and+peri-urban+transformations+in+contemporary+Kolkata&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bose%2C+Pablo+Shiladitya&amp;isbn=9780494197691&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"30,Deflectionist institutions or beacons of hope? A study of national human rights commissions in Anglophone Africa,"This dissertation examines the activities of three key national human rights commissions (NHRCs) in Anglophone Africa, to assess whether they are ""deflectionist"" or resourceful institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights. It conducts a study of the NHRCs in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa as a pointer to an understanding of NHRCs in Anglophone Africa. It seeks to discover whether NHRCs are useful additions to the body of national institutions that protect human rights or largely irrelevant bodies with little or no utility to local human rights struggles and the observance of international human rights standards. On the strength of a combination of interdisciplinary, doctrinal, theoretical and fieldwork research, this dissertation examines the problem of the (ir)relevance of NHRCs in Anglophone Africa and concludes that these institutions are critical partners in the protection and promotion of human rights. Owing to domestic judicial constraints and ineffectual international mechanisms for the promotion and protection of international human rights standards, states were encouraged by the UN to consider the desirability of empowering independent state institutions to advance the protection and promotion of human rights standards at the domestic level. The initiative was backed by the UN documents which prescribe the minimum standards for the establishment and operation of these institutions. This led to the proliferation of NHRCs in Anglophone Africa in the 1990s with mandates to protect and promote human rights. While some scholars and groups have taken umbrage at the establishment of NHRCs, arguing that they are redundant institutions that should be done away with, others have viewed them as crucial partners for the protection and promotion of human rights. In assessing the impact and effectiveness of NHRCs, this dissertation explores extant conceptions such as the dominant and the holistic conceptions of an ideal NHRC. While agreeing with some of the propositions of these key conceptions, the dissertation develops a deflectionist conception of an optimum NHRC and also employs the social movement theory to show that NHRCs in Anglophone Africa have a chance to optimize their full potential by undergoing transformation as focal points for the development of mass social movement action in the area of human rights. Such transformations require the cultivation of an effective connection with the grassroots and the use of mass mobilization as a valuable strategy to secure human rights. The dissertation concludes that NHRCs in Anglophone Africa have made modest achievements in the protection and promotion of human rights, and are, therefore, useful additions to this subject. However, it argues that it is only if they become central spots for the development of social movement action in the struggle for the protection of human rights that they would be able to transcend their modest achievements and stimulate fundamental social transformations and positive cultures that enthrone a language of human rights catechism in Anglophone Africa.",304982294,,Dissertations & Theses," Idike, Chinedu E.IdikeE.ChineduIdike, Chinedu E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251841241 , 32784171 , 66569 , 9780494197851 , NR19785 , NR19785", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494197851, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304982294?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," Social sciences , Africa , Anglophone , Deflectionist institutions , Human rights , National human rights commissions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Deflectionist+institutions+or+beacons+of+hope%3F+A+study+of+national+human+rights+commissions+in+Anglophone+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Idike%2C+Chinedu+E.&amp;isbn=9780494197851&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"31,"Performing nationalism: Mariachi, media and transformation of a tradition (1920–1942)","This dissertation focuses on the development of mariachi as an ensemble and a repertory between 1920 and 1942 with particular attention to relationships with the Mexican and U.S. radio, recording and film industries. Mariachi, a music and dance tradition from Mexico’s western region was transformed during this period from a rural mestizo cultural expression to an international visual and sound symbol of national identity. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the competing ideologies of hispanismo and indigenismo infused Mexican sociopolitical and cultural discourses with concepts of identity that reflected Spanish and Indigenous influences. In the postrevolutionary period, the government promoted a version of national identity based on the concept of mestizaje located within rural expressive culture. As regional musical traditions became central elements in the project of cultural nationalism, mariachi emerged as a marker of national identity and symbol of mexicanidad. With the movement of large populations to Mexico City in the mid 1920s, mariachi was integrated into urban social and cultural life. The activities of U.S. transnational record companies surged in the late 1920s and early 30s through alliances with radio stations and the creation of networks. Radio stations XEB and XEW were the main sources for broadcasting of Mexican popular music and radio shows were designed for the purpose of advertising U.S. consumer products. The creation of radio networks and increased record distribution effectively absorbed mariachi into processes for the media production of culture and “split” the ensemble from its traditional contexts and practices of performance. With the success of the comedia ranchera film genre in the late 1930s and early 40s, mariachi reached unimaginable heights of popularity. The singing charro, a symbol of machismo and virility, was embodied in the figures and voices of Tito Guízar and Jorge Negrete - icons of the genre. As a vehicle for the canción ranchera, the films of the “golden age” projected the image and sound of mexicanidad through processes of musical commodification associated with the contexts and conditions of the Mexican and U.S. transnational media industries.",304983966,,Dissertations & Theses," Henriques, Donald AndrewHenriquesAndrewDonaldHenriques, Donald Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1453224391 , 32566761 , 66569 , 9780549386162 , 3294414 , 3294414", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780549386162, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304983966?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Ethnomusicology , Mariachi , Media , Mexico , Nationalism , Performing , Tradition",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performing+nationalism%3A+Mariachi%2C+media+and+transformation+of+a+tradition+%281920%E2%80%931942%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Henriques%2C+Donald+Andrew&amp;isbn=9780549386162&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"32,"“I used the term ‘Negro’ and I was firmly corrected”: African independence, Black Power and channels of diasporic resistance","This dissertation asserts that institutions indigenous to the African diaspora facilitate transnational exchanges between black social movements by encouraging organizations and activists to identify with each other across national boundaries. Using the research methods of content analysis, in-depth interview and archival research, this project focuses on exchanges of ideas and tactics between the Black Panther Party, Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and African independence movements in Algeria, Congo, Ghana, Guinea and South Africa that were facilitated by the black press, black institutions of higher learning and emancipated spaces . Through its comparative, interdisciplinary approach that unites literatures concerning social movements, race, ethnicity and politics and the African diaspora, "" I Used the Term 'Negro' and I was Firmly Corrected "" enhances our understanding of transnational relationships between social movements, the roles that indigenous institutions play in fostering racial solidarity and the relationship between identity and protest in historically marginalized communities. This project theorizes that, in three ways, institutions indigenous to the African diaspora foster the mutual identification between organizations and activists that social movement theorists agree is necessary for transnational exchanges between social movements. First, indigenous institutions devote their resources to gathering and sharing information about social movement organizations and activists throughout the diaspora. Second, these institutions filter this information through their communities' master injustice frames , which I define as the philosophies, narratives and actions that historically marginalized communities most consistently utilize over time to articulate their subjugation as unjust and build intra-group solidarity. Third, they authenticate the claims and work of black social movements in other countries that are consistent with the parameters of their communities' master injustice frames . This theory draws on the social movement literature's conception of cross-national social movement diffusion; debates in the race, ethnicity and politics literature about the roles that indigenous institutions play in the struggles of historically marginalized communities and historical accounts of transnational relationships found in the study of the African diaspora.",304984158,,Dissertations & Theses," Hayes, Robin J.HayesJ.RobinHayes, Robin J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1147194521 , 33796201 , 66569 , 9780542651991 , 3214221 , 3214221", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542651991, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304984158?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies"," 0615 Political science , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies"," 0615 Political science , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies",," 0615 Political science , 0328 Black history , 0323 American studies"," Political science , Black history , American studies"," Social sciences , African , Black Power , Identity , Independence , Nationalism , Resistance , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CI+used+the+term+%E2%80%98Negro%E2%80%99+and+I+was+firmly+corrected%E2%80%9D%3A+African+independence%2C+Black+Power+and+channels+of+diasporic+resistance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hayes%2C+Robin+J.&amp;isbn=9780542651991&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"33,"Communicative institutions: The Internet, democracy and the communication of difference","What is the character of social and political organization in a society connected by the Internet? While this question does not lack responses, the most popular—virtual community and networked society—replay either the longing for lost community or the anxiety over a fragmented society that has dominated modern social thought since its inception. Online communication is imagined as encouraging more reciprocity and enhancing democracy or, conversely, further disseminating instrumental control. To move past this reductive ""duality of communication"" it is necessary to avoid defining communication as a potentially transparent interaction between already constituted subjects and, instead, understand how different media contribute to the practical organization of human interaction and the material and symbolic institution of social and political life. In the case of the Internet, governments, associations and social movements each construct the Internet differently, and thereby contribute to the institution of a variety of different social relations and political subjects, both private and public. The theoretical object ""the Internet,"" therefore, cannot be reduced to a single function, technical quality or political tendency. Instead, it stands for a constellation of practises—some which control people and others that enable people to assert their own control. By investigating the various ways in which governments, associations and movements come to interact with the Internet—specifically in terms of democratic practice—this dissertation will explain how the public citizen is displaced by the private client-consumer, how participatory community is trumped by the exchanges between categorical identities, but also how the activity of social movements both propagates private factions and, potentially, institutes a new public. On the way, a case will be made for the importance of disseminating—as opposed to reciprocal—communication in encouraging an online politics that is attentive to difference. As a complex of communicative institutions, the Internet is also the institution of a potentially global, self-reflexive attitude that supports an expanding democratic politics and serves as a model for developing a truly comparative theory of the media.",304984385,,Dissertations & Theses," Burgwin, DarrylBurgwinDarrylBurgwin, Darryl",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1390280581 , 32784861 , 66569 , 9780494294857 , NR29485 , NR29485", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494294857, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304984385?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0708 Mass media"," 0626 Sociology , 0708 Mass media"," 0626 Sociology , 0708 Mass media",," 0626 Sociology , 0708 Mass media"," Sociology , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Communication , Democracy , Institutions , Internet",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communicative+institutions%3A+The+Internet%2C+democracy+and+the+communication+of+difference&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burgwin%2C+Darryl&amp;isbn=9780494294857&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"34,Constructed identities: New social movements and computer -mediated communication in the Middle East,"International communications is an important component of the international system at the dawn of the 21st century.

I am interested in examining the socio-economic and socio-political factors that make modern information technology a useful and viable tool for political and social movements in dealing with state policies. The rigid control of the traditional media by the state in the Middle East has forced social movements in the region to work as expatriate movements based outside the region. By locating themselves outside the rigid control of Middle Eastern states, these social movements are internationalizing their disagreements with the state. They benefit from more liberal laws and greater freedom. The importance of international communication cannot be, but often is, overlooked in the literature.

In so doing, I examine the bases, mechanisms, and consequences of this resonance both for the Zapatistas and for these activists and their struggles far beyond the borders of Mexico. Strongly implicated in this focus are issues of the building of transnational and even global social movements and the potentials of and challenges to radical collective socio-political action across borders. Drawing upon a year of interview and participant observation-based fieldwork beginning in the fall of 2003, I focus upon the phenomenon of ""transnational resonance"" and its connection to the articulation of new political spaces and practices in the north. In exploring the transnational resonance of Zapatismo and its political imagination amongst northern activists, I consider not only the processes of transmitting, translating, and enacting political struggles across borders but the role played by socio-political contexts and (hi)stories of political action in shaping the dynamics of this resonance. This research seeks to intervene in debates about political action and political alternatives, particularly in relation to the spread and crises of global neoliberal capitalism and liberal democratic ideology, and to contribute to the illumination of emerging political terrains of struggle and the political subjectivities who inhabit them.

In the context of post-World War II political and social struggles, refuge offers tenuous, temporary safety for those targeted by violence and new strategies for creating alternative collectivities beyond the refuge space. Identifying representations of refuge in novels by Bessie Head, Toni Morrison, Michael Ondaatje, and Kazuo Ishiguro, this dissertation charts the challenges of narrating such alternative collectivities in a global context. Chapter One considers the terms of refuge: the aesthetic and ethical literary strategies deployed in refuge narratives, and the critical context of their production in an era of widespread forced displacement and weakened nation-states. Chapter Two examines the representation of rural, post-colonial refuge in Bessie Head's 1969 novel, When Rain Clouds Gather . In her depiction of an international, cooperative farming community, Head focuses her narrative on representing the everyday, collective relationships that enable individual development of political consciousness and agency. The third chapter explores the relationship of refuge to contemporary communities of resistance through a reading of Toni Morrison's Paradise . Representing individuals excluded from the liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Morrison's novel re-imagines the terms of liberation through refuge's production of non-utopian, international and transcultural frameworks that sustain local responses to systemic violence. Chapter Four investigates refuge as an ethical response to a call to war in Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient and Anil's Ghost . Ondaatje's characters take refuge as a means of reconstructing the ethics and epistemologies that shape their participation in collectivities that encompass extreme cultural and social differences. In Chapter Five, Kazuo Ishiguro's deployment of refuge to explore collectivity in the context of global conflict is examined. Through characters born into unstable and threatened international refuges in World War 11-era Japan, England, and China, Ishiguro probes the consequences of exile from such spaces by the pressure of national demands. In each of these novels, refuge emerges not as an allegorical stage for reworking traditional forms of collectivity, but as a set of narrative and ethical practices that engage with contemporary conditions of social struggle.",305272180,,Dissertations & Theses," Gosselink, Karin JeanGosselinkJeanKarinGosselink, Karin Jean",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1268595471 , 32640991 , 66569 , 3249297 , 3249297", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305272180?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0316 African literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0316 African literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0316 African literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0316 African literature , 0352 Canadian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Comparative literature , Literature , African literature , Canadian literature , American literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Anglophone , Collectivity , Fiction , Head, Bessie , Ishiguro, Kazuo , Morrison, Toni , Ondaatje, Michael , Refuge",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+terms+of+refuge%3A++Collectivity+in+contemporary+global+Anglophone+fiction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gosselink%2C+Karin+Jean&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"37,"Move.

I explore the larger Independent Media Center Network, beginning in the Zapatista Encuentros of the late Nineties, the ""trial run"" in Seattle during the meeting of the World Trade Organization in 1999 and the subsequent growth into a world wide network with almost 200 local collectives producing radical news and providing distribution outlets for media makers. Indymedia is situated within a social movement, commonly known as anti-globalization, but more properly termed the global justice movement. I investigate indymedia videos as insider media; videos that come out of are circulated within and support the social movement. Indymedia videos are political interventions, but they also constitute a social intervention as IMC videographers make politically informed choices to shape the filmmaking process itself. Social movement based media is not a new phenomena, and as part of this dissertation, I explore several examples of other radical film collectives operating in different historical periods with different technological apparatuses. I treat the complication of being a group committed to openness and democracy in an environment of political repression and surveillance.

Drawing on ethnographic field research in New York City, Southern Africa, India, and Australia, the work offers a multi-sited historical and cultural anthropological analysis of the global proliferation of a music and drug subculture with origins in Goa, India. Tracking both the commercial emergence of the Goa Trance musical genre and the international traffic in ""psychedelic"" and ""empathogenic"" chemical substances for which Goa Trance communities of practice are known, the dissertation moves between discursive, historical, and experiential sites at which a distinct embodied politics and spatial imagination have been articulated. In exploring a highly networked social movement that has deployed late-capitalism's chief tropes---flexibility, mobility, and instantaneity---in constructing spaces of affective and experiential value held to transcend of mundane forms of capital-driven sociality, the work centers Goa Trance's rapidly shifting social and economic form as a valuable case study into the dynamic interplay of ephemerality and continuity in the contemporary (re)production of cultural difference. In an age of anxious speculation about the fate of durable cultural emplacements of all varieties, this dissertation argues that highly mobile (and seemingly transient) social forms represent critical sites at which to examine both existing strategies for combating and policing cultural objectification and the reproductive logics by which these forms of resistance are so rapidly incorporated at the vanguard of transnational culture industries.",305276367,,Dissertations & Theses," Elliott, Luther C.ElliottC.LutherElliott, Luther C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1184158681 , 34355971 , 66569 , 9780542751653 , 3221945 , 3221945", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542751653, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305276367?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Drug culture , Ethnomusicology , Goa Trance , Material culture , Music genre , Niche music",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mobile+consciousness%2C+flexible+culture%3A+Notes+on+the+rise+and+fall+of+Goa+Trance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elliott%2C+Luther+C.&amp;isbn=9780542751653&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"39,Help or hindrance: How transnational ties shape community mobilization in post-war Guatemala,"As more people, information and resources cross borders, there is burgeoning enthusiasm for the idea that transnational relationships will ameliorate the critical needs faced by poor communities in the global South. This enthusiasm should be tempered, however, by the recognition that these relationships frequently produce unintended consequences, which can be devastating for impoverished communities. This dissertation explores the promise and perils of transnational resources in post-war Guatemala. Drawing on insights from social movement theory and the sociology of development, it explores such concepts as collective identity, social capital, movement outcomes and community development. This dissertation examines four complex issues. First, what types of communities and collective identities lead to the formation of transnational alliances between domestic movements and international actors? Second, once these transnational ties have developed, how does the quantity and quality of the resulting social capital affect mobilization trajectories? The third question asks which aspects of mobilization---material or emotional---count the most for movement outcomes? Finally, in the absence of state support for economic development goals, can transnational allies fill the gap? To explore these questions, this dissertation utilizes a range of qualitative research methods: fieldwork in two communities; approximately 100 semi-structured interviews throughout Guatemala; review of primary documents from the two communities and their NGO partners; and observation of workshops, conferences and rallies relevant to the Guatemalan peasant movement. Based on a comparison of two communities that developed extensive transnational ties in the post-war era, I find that transnational ties produce divergent results. One community has become a regional leader in education, community organization and sustainable development, while the second community has experienced a string of project failures, the gradual erosion of civic participation and is on the brink of dissolution. This dissertation argues that the nature of the transnational relationships formed by each community has proven pivotal to their post-war trajectories.",305281672,,Dissertations & Theses," Stewart, JulieStewartJulieStewart, Julie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1232425891 , 34357761 , 66569 , 9780542878039 , 3234183 , 3234183", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542878039, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305281672?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0630 Welfare , 0336 Latin American history"," 0700 Social structure , 0630 Welfare , 0336 Latin American history"," 0700 Social structure , 0630 Welfare , 0336 Latin American history",," 0700 Social structure , 0630 Welfare , 0336 Latin American history"," Social structure , Welfare , Latin American history"," Social sciences , Collective identity , Community mobilization , Guatemala , Postwar , Transnational ties",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Help+or+hindrance%3A+How+transnational+ties+shape+community+mobilization+in+post-war+Guatemala&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stewart%2C+Julie&amp;isbn=9780542878039&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"40,"Gendering the Cold War: Race, *class and women's peace politics, 1945–1975","This study reconsiders previous assumptions about the political activism of leftist women in Cold War America using the post-World War II Progressive Party (PP) as its entry point. The work of Progressive women to join the international peace movement to the causes of civil rights and liberties, economic justice, and social welfare has been largely overlooked by political and social movement historians whose analysis of the successes and (mostly) failures of postwar progressivism has centered on the fate of formal organizations during the period of political repression known as McCarthyism. I argue that leftist women remained passionately committed to political activism during this period and that peace was the thread that connected their postwar agenda. Progressive women's decades-long efforts to keep that thread from unraveling---and with it the association between peace, feminism, and social justice---is the story told here. While prominent historians argue that U.S. Cold War domestic and foreign policy successfully obstructed leftist movements, which only began to recover in the 1960s, this dissertation illustrates that working in groups like the PP and in loosely organized networks after its demise, Progressive women were able to sustain a radical critique of both domestic and foreign policy in the nascent Cold War years, helping to shape postwar political culture.",305291506,,Dissertations & Theses," Castledine, Jacqueline AnnCastledineAnnJacquelineCastledine, Jacqueline Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251834111 , 32999781 , 66569 , 9780542952616 , 3240195 , 3240195", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542952616, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305291506?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Class , Cold War , Gendering , Left feminism , Peace politics , Progressive Party , Race , Wallace, Henry Agard , Women activists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendering+the+Cold+War%3A++Race%2C++*class+and+women%27s+peace+politics%2C+1945%E2%80%931975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Castledine%2C+Jacqueline+Ann&amp;isbn=9780542952616&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"41,"Education, civil society, and social change: A case study of a Brazilian social movement","For the last twenty-five years, the Landless Worker's Movement (MST) has organized some 1.5 million landless rural workers to claim and occupy unutilized cultivable land to which they are legally entitled under the 1988 Constitution. The movement has been instrumental in the redistribution of unused cultivable land to thousands of landless rural families and the creation of a new positive identity for rural people that values their culture, knowledge, and autonomy. In doing so, the movement has become a global exemplar for a more equitable, just, and sustainable approach to development. A philosophy and practice of education that is democratic and responsive to the social and economic contexts of rural learners has played a key role in the expansion and longevity of this popular movement. My dissertation looks at the ways in which the MST has contributed to improving the quality of education policy and programming for rural children, youth, and adults. My dissertation begins with an examination of the ideologies and institutional arrangements that have historically shaped the formulation and implementation of policies for rural basic education in Brazil. I discuss relationships between the state, market, and society and, in particular, the construction of alternative policy arenas and discourses by organized civil society that have shaped current efforts by the federal government to develop a national rural education policy. I go on to examine the micro-interactions between the state and the MST in the context of literacy programs for rural youth and adults in the state of Rio de Janeiro. In this context, I discuss the possibilities for expanded participation in policy formulation and implementation for basic education for (a) organized civil society, (b) rural communities, (c) educators, and (d) learners.

Using Newmont Mining Corporation in Denver and Newmont's Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Sumbawa (Indonesia) as case studies, I trace the emergence and dynamics of CSR in relation to neoliberal policies, civil society, contemporary development trends, and competing moral discourses. The promotion and expansion of corporate activity through neoliberal policies over the past two decades has generated countermovements and public demands for corporate accountability and restraint. In reaction, corporations have proposed to voluntarily regulate themselves and establish new partnerships with civil society ""stakeholders."" I approach CSR as an internal and external extension of corporate power and knowledge that reconfigures corporations and the social contexts in which they operate. From activist critics and the development industry, CSR experts have appropriated a moral lexicon of sustainability, participation, empowerment, transparency, accountability, and good governance that they apply to stakeholders. Corporate agents use these moral discourses, sometimes coercively, to underscore the responsibilities of stakeholders as opposed to their rights or entitlements. In chapters on Newmont's interactions with Indonesian contractors, peasant farmers, government officials, and transnational advocacy networks, I analyze these moral discourses as well as social struggles over how Newmont's responsibility is properly defined and enacted around the Batu Hijau mine. Within Newmont, CSR experts rationalize new expenditures and behavioral routines with the ""business case"" claim that CSR safeguards profits, enhances public reputation, and manages social risks. To back up this claim and install CSR practices, experts institute calculating and auditing technologies to render the practices of distant corporate agents visible and quantifiable, as well as to foster self-auditing capacities among employees. CSR efforts to impose new moral discourses and calculating practices on corporate and external subjects often yield unpredictable consequences and create new terrains for negotiating corporate practice. Yet these new terrains are dominated by corporations and civil society representatives rather than by actors who are held publicly accountable via democratic mechanisms.",305301848,,Dissertations & Theses," Welker, Marina AndreaWelkerAndreaMarinaWelker, Marina Andrea",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251832211 , 33190641 , 66569 , 9780542924415 , 3238111 , 3238111", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542924415, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305301848?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0454 Management"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0454 Management"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0454 Management",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0454 Management"," Cultural anthropology , Management , Globalization , Capitalism , Mining industry , Corporate responsibility , Social responsibility , Studies , United States--US , Indonesia"," Social sciences , Colorado , Corporate social responsibility , Denver , Global capitalism , Indonesia , Mining",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+capitalism+and+the+%E2%80%9Ccaring+corporation%E2%80%9D%3A%0AMining+and+the+corporate+social+responsibility+movement+in+Indonesia+and+Denver&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Welker%2C+Marina+Andrea&amp;isbn=9780542924415&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"43,"The girls from the prayer room: The women's Islamist movement at Yarmouk University, Jordan","This dissertation is an ethnographic study of the women's Islamist movement at Yarmouk University, Jordan, based on eighteen months of participant observation and interviewing conducted between August 2001 and December 2005. It traces how Islamism transforms the practical moral systems which structure social relationships at the university. Most students enact relationships on campus with their families in mind. Students treat others generously and considerately, act hospitably towards guests, and avoid illicit sexual encounters in order to uphold the reputations of their families. Islamists, on the other hand, act to please God before human authority figures. Their obligations are thereby rendered portable in a way that family strictures are not. Islamists attend to their obligations to all humans, rather than just their friends and relatives; this attention has earned them the reputation of being particularly dutiful among other Jordanians. They work spread their movement through social links, in pyramidal fashion. Both by means of kindness and through direct proselytizing, Islamists draw in an ever increasing circle of members who, in turn, live by Islamist principles. In the Islamic society which they imagine and seek, all relationships from interpersonal to international would be enacted according to their moral code of obligation. I examine Islamism as a universalist moral system, based in a universalist conception of the human. This system cannot be grasped if it is cast relativistically as a particular instance of human possibility. It must, instead, be considered as a universal which entails its own particular instances. In order to see this ideology as it is, then, it is necessary to actively reject the tendency of much Western social analysis to understand the ""Other"" through the Western universal of Humanism. To this end, I make explicit the contrast between my subjects' ideas and their American counterparts which is implicit in most recent American anthropology.",305301970,,Dissertations & Theses," Pearl, Laura K.PearlK.LauraPearl, Laura K.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1232400481 , 33190641 , 66569 , 9780542922176 , 3238053 , 3238053", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542922176, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305301970?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Middle Eastern history , Womens studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , College students , Islamist movement , Jordan , Moral systems , Women students , Yarmouk University",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+girls+from+the+prayer+room%3A+The+women%27s+Islamist+movement+at+Yarmouk+University%2C+Jordan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pearl%2C+Laura+K.&amp;isbn=9780542922176&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"44,"“Hands that never rest”: Ainu women, cultural revival, and indigenous politics in Japan","This dissertation examines Ainu women's strategies within the cultural revival movement to revitalize visual and material culture arts, and to reintroduce traditional cultural practices to contemporary lifestyles. I contend that Ainu women's cultural work, while articulated in an apolitical register, provides symbolic leverage for the Ainu rights reclamation movement, advancing Ainu indigeneity claims against Japanese homogeneity. Through adapting historic practices, including embroidery, bast fiber weaving, and basketry, contemporary Ainu women re-work ancestral values. Through these practices, women craft themselves as agents---symbolically, socially, and discursively---to contest legacies of colonialism and discrimination that have marginalized them from majority Japanese society. I elaborate the contexts wherein women, and not men, are compelled to engage in material culture production, including embroidery workshops, state-sponsored programs, tourist market production, and museum replica-making. Ainu activists draw from a U.N.-influenced discourse of indigeneity to transcend the nation-state, employing transnational moral arguments to shame the Japanese state into ethical treatment of: internal minorities. Under the Ainu Cultural Promotion Act (1997), the state has claimed Ainu culture as national heritage; however, detractors criticize this law as co-opting sovereign cultural identity, and reinforcing Ainu marginalization. Nevertheless, I argue that Ainu women are capitalizing on Promotion Act initiatives to generate economic stability, symbolic capital, and to re-invent themselves as indigenous. By embodying cultural and social reproduction through clothwork, women envision themselves as practitioners and creators of communitarian genealogy, i.e. these practices allow them to create linkages with ancestors, gods, and the Ainu Diaspora across Japan. Based on eighteen months of ethnographic and museum research from 2004 to 2005, in Hokkaido, Japan, I demonstrate how local engagement with global indigenous discourse has empowered women to negotiate questions of authenticity and to recuperate themselves as Ainu, despite historical ruptures.

The study seeks to explain why so many young people in Latin America were drawn to the revolutionary option in these decades, the influence of a global counterculture on these young revolutionaries, and the gender promises and limitations of such movements. A social and cultural history of the student movement associated with the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), the dissertation examines the importance of student politics and youth culture for the growth of the FSLN, the negotiation of gender identities within the movement, and the relationship between popular and state-driven memories of the Sandinista struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. Making use of oral histories and archival documents collected during more than twelve months of fieldwork in Nicaragua, it argues that the FSLN was able to broaden its popular appeal as a viable political alternative by building on a history of student political activity. As all aspects of university life became highly politicized during the 1960s and 1970s, FSLN recruitment efforts among both middle- and working-class youth were aided by students' self-appointed role as nationalist intellectuals, a dynamic student movement with an activist orientation, and a politicized youth culture that questioned the social, political and economic status quo. The dissertation thus explains precisely what conditions placed Nicaraguan youth, and students in particular, at the forefront of oppositional political activity in these decades.",305309342,,Dissertations & Theses," Barbosa, Francisco J.BarbosaJ.FranciscoBarbosa, Francisco J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1147181591 , 32784011 , 66569 , 9780542653438 , 3215180 , 3215180", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542653438, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305309342?accountid=14496, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history,, 0336 Latin American history, Latin American history," Social sciences , Memory , Nicaragua , Sandinista , Student movement , Youth culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Insurgent+youth%3A++Culture+and+memory+in+the+Sandinista+student+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barbosa%2C+Francisco+J.&amp;isbn=9780542653438&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"46,"State power, people power, and the politics of disability in Japan","Japan's disability movement, as with most social movements, consists of a broad array of groups and organizations. However, over the past two decades eight organizations have emerged as major representatives of the disability community in Japan. Those organizations were faced with a challenge in early 2004. The Japanese government announced plans to massively restructure a popular national disability services system know as the shienpi or ""support payments"" system. The restructuring was part of cost cutting measures and would bring usage limitations and higher usage fees for disability services in Japan. The eight organizations initially put up a united stance in opposition to the government's proposal; however, within six months of their united opposition to the government, the organizations were split in regard to the issue. Using a social movement theoretical frame, this dissertation investigates, firstly, the dynamics behind the building of cooperation among the disability movement organizations, and secondly, the reasons behind the dissolution of that cooperation. It is argued that the organizations which comprise Japan's disability movement have historically developed in a manner that they can be roughly characterized as falling into one of two groups: ""1 st Generation Organizations"" which developed during the period immediately following WWII and are mainly social service oriented, or ""2 nd Generation Organizations"" which developed post-International Year for Disabled Persons (1981) and are mainly social reform oriented. Though differing in orientation, the 1 st and 2 nd Generation Organizations developed a pattern of working collaboratively due to two unifying factors: (1) The Asian Pacific Decade for Disabled Persons, and (2) The initial development of the shienpi system. From the pattern of working collaboratively, the 1 st and 2 nd Generation Organizations where able to put up an initial united stance against the government. However, concern over the maintenance of financial relations with the state by some organizations, coupled with the influence of the fundamental differences of the organizations caused the united stance to dissolve. The findings of the study are a verification of the resource mobilization and political process models within the social movement literature, and a clarification of the new social movement theoretical model.",305310984,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, Leon Daniel, IIBrownDanielLeonIIBrown, Leon Daniel, II",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1147196071 , 33796501 , 66569 , 9780542563270 , 3208287 , 3208287", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542563270, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305310984?accountid=14496," 0630 Welfare , 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," 0630 Welfare , 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," 0630 Welfare , 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration",," 0630 Welfare , 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," Welfare , Political science , Public administration"," Social sciences , Disability , Handicap , Japan , People power , Politics , State power",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=State+power%2C+people+power%2C+and+the+politics+of+disability+in+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Leon+Daniel%2C+II&amp;isbn=9780542563270&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"47,"Broken idols: Migration, globalization, and cultural change in Honduras","This is an ethnographic study of a coffee-growing community in Honduras, which was in the midst of a transition to economic reliance on migration to the United States from 2001 to 2004, when field research was conducted by the author. The author focuses on the origins and contemporary dynamics of Honduran emigration, and explores the impact of emigration on local society and culture. He argues that migration has led to a profound sense of confusion within a single community, identified by the pseudonym of ""La Quebrada."" In this town, migration is generally described in negative terms, and migrants are often seen as the cause of socioeconomic crisis, rather than its victims. The author describes two local responses to emigration in La Quebrada: the rise of evangelical churches and the establishment of a fair trade coffee cooperative. Evangelical churches offer solutions to many of the social problems caused by emigration, and fair trade production offers an economic alternative to migration for coffee farmers. He draws a parallel between local criticisms of migrants as the source of social decline, the explanations of social crisis offered by the evangelical churches, and the philosophy of fair trade. In each case, people express concern about the manner in which their community has been integrated into the global economy, but they believe that individual behavior is the only viable source of social reform. This emphasis on the individual, abstracted from social totalities, limits the political potential of these movements. The author concludes that these movements articulate a sense of popular anxiety over the community's future, and a desire to refashion society for the collective good. However, the forms that these popular responses have taken is based on a belief that no political institution can mediate between the individual and the global market. The tendency to conceptualize sociopolitical reform in individualized terms, he argues, reflects macro-level cultural changes that have occurred around the globe in the past twenty years.",305321820,,Dissertations & Theses," Reichman, Daniel RossReichmanRossDanielReichman, Daniel Ross",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1192181231 , 17978631 , 66569 , 9780542788444 , 3227225 , 3227225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542788444, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305321820?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history"," Social sciences , Cultural change , Fair trade , Globalization , Honduras , Migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Broken+idols%3A+Migration%2C+globalization%2C+and+cultural+change+in+Honduras&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reichman%2C+Daniel+Ross&amp;isbn=9780542788444&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"48,"The disability rights movement in Taiwan: Modernity, civil society and politics of difference","In Taiwan, disability has long been considered a personal and family issue within the private domain of society. Starting in the 1980s, however, disability issues, particularly the rights of disabled citizens, have been brought into the public sphere through an increasing number of organized collective actions. Based on archival analysis, participant observation, and interviews with disability rights activists, this study investigates the cultural transformation of disability discourse and the institutional formation of the disability rights movement in the context of Taiwan's democratization and burgeoning civil society from the 1980s to 2002. I first identify the main actors, organizational bases, and macro-political structural conditions that shaped the disability rights movement and transformed it in accordance with the changing dynamics between the state and society. I demonstrate that the Taiwanese disability rights movement arose at a particular historical conjuncture of globalization, state transformation, and burgeoning civil society and resulted in a renegotiated social contract for citizens with disabilities. Second, I analyze the identity transformation and empowerment of disability rights activists. The participants in this movement, mainly mothers of intellectually disabled children, confronted social stigma and renegotiated their gender roles by participating in civic organizations and promoting the welfare of their children. Third, I focus on the largest disability rights organization in Taiwan, the Parents' Association for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PAPID). I investigate the institutional transformation of this and other disability rights civic organizations in the context of shifting state-society relations. I analyze how the voluntary grassroots movement slowly became encapsulated by state corporatism. In this process, advocacy social organizations were transformed into non-profit organizations (NPOs), and many new service-oriented organizations became subcontractors for the state and competed for state funding. This study suggests that social movements, civil society, and identity transformation are constituted by and constitutive of the evolving process of democratization in Taiwan. As a largely new phenomena unleashed by global capitalism and transnational cultural interaction, the democratization process in Taiwan invites a more historical and contextual analysis of the intricate relationships among state, civil society, human rights, and global forces.",305324924,,Dissertations & Theses," Chang, Heng-haoChangHeng-haoChang, Heng-hao",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1253507521 , 35542311 , 66569 , 3244708 , 3244708", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305324924?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Welfare"," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Welfare"," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Welfare",," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Welfare"," Sociology , Welfare"," Social sciences , China , Civil society , Disability rights , Modernity , Politics , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+disability+rights+movement+in+Taiwan%3A+Modernity%2C+civil+society+and+politics+of+difference&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chang%2C+Heng-hao&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"49,"My voice is my weapon: Music, nationalism, and the poetics of Palestinian resistance","""My Voice is My Weapon"" examines the dynamics of music, nationalism, and resistance as realized through performance among Palestinians in Israel, the occupied territories, and Jordan. Based on eighteen months ethnographic fieldwork this dissertation explores the ways in which music and musical performance have fashioned and disseminated markers of a distinct Palestinian identity, and then traces how this identity has been historically articulated through various local, national, and transnational contexts. In so doing, this dissertation engages issues of national discourse, hegemony, and resistance; and argues for the utility of music and popular culture in resolving central questions of individual subjectivity and collective identity formation. This dissertation focuses specifically on three interrelated sites of performance (Amman, Ramallah, and Tel Aviv) and three repertories of Palestinian resistance music (indigenous Palestinian folklore, protest song, and popular hip-hop/rap). After an introductory theoretical chapter on the politics of ethnography and violence, and the capacities of music and musical performance to ameliorate the effects of social trauma, this dissertation traces the historical development of Palestinian resistance music (intifada song) as a crucial site for the development of Palestinian national identities. Through a detailed musical and textual analysis, this dissertation explores many of the dominant symbols, myths, and meanings inherent to this repertory, deconstructing the indexical associations that constitute the poetics of Palestinian resistance. Next, this dissertation explores the interrelations of music performance, violence, and the Palestinian resistance movement through a biographical sketch of one of the intifada's most celebrated resistance singers, Kamal Khalil. The final two chapters examine the burgeoning Palestinian hip-hop movement as representing a new direction in resistance music. This movement, spearheaded largely by a group of young Palestinian-Israelis, illustrates how many Palestinians living in Israel must navigate the interstices of both Palestinian and Israeli national narratives. The development of Palestinian hip-hop reveals a new discursive field where the established Palestinian/Israeli binary breaks down, and areas of cultural interconnectedness become apparent. Such a movement reveals the limits of the dominant nation-state discourse, and offers new lines of inquiry into processes of globalization and transnationalism in a post-national world.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

A case study of transnational human rights networks in Jordan","In the past few decades, small but critical groups of individuals and organizations around the world have joined with people beyond their national borders to promote political change. This dissertation examines the impact of such transnational networks in semi-authoritarian regimes through a study of changes in human rights policies in Jordan. Based on an analysis of two transnational human rights campaigns in Jordan, this dissertation argues that the networks' impact on human rights policies will be determined by three factors (1) the regimes' practices, (2) the nature of the issue undertaken, and (3) the organizational structure of the network. The campaigns highlighted include a transnational struggle to address repressive press laws (1993-2004) and a campaign to protect women from gender-based violence (1993-2004). The press campaign constitutes a partnership between local activists and NGOs and external (or international) NGOs. The linkages between these non-state actors constitute a transnational network which strives to develop as a counterweight to the state. In contrast, the second campaign is an example of a transnational social movement around women's rights that has worked with the Jordanian state to implement new policies. The present research project on human rights networks illuminates gaps in both the Middle East studies literature and in the scholarship on transnational politics by demonstrating that transnational political advocacy has not only arrived but has made an impact on human rights policies in the Middle East. In addition, the project adds to our knowledge of the way transnational networks navigate in regimes that are neither fully authoritarian nor democratic. The Jordanian regime accepts democracy rhetorically but in fact restricts many of the freedoms usually enjoyed in such a system. Hence, the country is open enough for transnational networks to flourish. Yet human rights pressures in Jordan have led to mixed results. The research shows that semi-authoritarian regimes have a distinct impact on the work of transnational advocacy networks, as the state alters laws and institutions according to its own interests. Thus, transnational networks have a greater impact on promoting change with respect to issues that empower the state, even ones that appear at first to have little grounding in local norms. Because the ruling regime is not interested in moving from one governing system to another, networks that challenge the state's autonomy will have less power in achieving their goals of creating institutions that limit the state. In addition, research from the Jordanian cases demonstrates that the relationship between constituent actors within transnational networks is more important than previously thought. This study pays close attention to the effects of those relationships on human rights outcomes, specifically the establishment and maintenance of network linkages. By focusing on different types of networks, this dissertation shows that while transnational initiatives can be helpful, they are also potentially counterproductive. Much of the prior work on transnational activism argued that a state's incremental concessions in the face of human rights pressures eventually led to changes in human rights practices. In contrast, this dissertation argues that hybrid regimes are adept at balancing such pressures in order to retain their control. In addition to the importance the study places on analyzing the issue-area and organizational structure of the network, this project contributes a new variable, that of transnational networks, to the emerging research agenda on the persistence of nondemocratic regimes since the third wave of democratization in the 1990s.",305333656,,Dissertations & Theses," Lieberman, Jessica DumesLiebermanDumesJessicaLieberman, Jessica Dumes",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1051280221 , 32334051 , 66569 , 9780542464485 , 0542464489 , 3199922 , 3199922", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542464485 , 0542464489", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305333656?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Civil society , Human rights , Jordan , Networks , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+means%2C+local+ends%3F+A+case+study+of+transnational+human+rights+networks+in+Jordan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lieberman%2C+Jessica+Dumes&amp;isbn=9780542464485&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"51,"The South Korean mediascape: State, civil society and the implications of regional political economy for cultural transformation","Globalization now receives as much or more attention as any concept in the academic lexicon. While scholars and pundits struggle to grasp its complex and varied worldwide manifestations, few researchers have yet focused on the South Korean media and its relationships with state and civil society, situated as it is within a complex political economic terrain. The role of agencies and institutions, especially state involvement in the media sector and in culture more broadly, has been controversial for communication scholars. In the last two decades a dramatic upsurge of neoliberal thinking has glorified the virtues of unregulated markets, and so-called ""end-of-history"" discourse has ideologically championed incessant deregulation and economic and cultural privatization. Many neoliberalist scholars have argued that human nature and the structure of modern political, economic and cultural activities are such that the more constrained is the state, the better will be the quality and competitiveness of the more autonomous realms of enterprise and civil society. By contrast, my aim is to provide a fuller understanding of the political economy of a national/regional, as well as global mediascape , and to offer a more nuanced analysis of the role of the state and civil society in global and local cultural transformations, by careful attention to the case study of South Korea. Specifically, I examine interventions by the state and civil society in transforming the scene of national and global mediascapes, focusing on their various policies, regulations, movements and other initiatives. While it would be absurd to deny the pressures on semi-periphery by powerful international organizations (e.g., the IMF or WTO), these global constraints and pressures do not wholly dictate policy outcomes, whether economic or cultural, and globalization is not an inevitable nor omnipotent force that utterly deprives societies of their ability to maneuver when they must decide on policy. Hence development or social changes are negotiated in a manner more complex than typically acknowledged by globalization scholars (from the left or right), and in ways that aim to open up closed and inefficient institutions and reflect local social conditions and its needs, and sometimes succeed in doing so.",305336817,,Dissertations & Theses," Ryoo, WoongjaeRyooWoongjaeRyoo, Woongjae",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1155570531 , 33963991 , 66569 , 9780542679612 , 3218324 , 3218324", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542679612, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305336817?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science"," 0708 Mass media , 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science"," 0708 Mass media , 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science",," 0708 Mass media , 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science"," Mass media , Journalism , Political science"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Civil society , Cultural transformation , Korean , Mediascape , Regional political economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+South+Korean+mediascape%3A+State%2C+civil+society+and+the+implications+of+regional+political+economy+for+cultural+transformation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ryoo%2C+Woongjae&amp;isbn=9780542679612&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"52,"Catholic social thought, regional economic integration, and immigration policy: Reconstructing Catholic social thinking regarding the right to freedom of movement","This thesis discusses how modern Catholic social thought (CST) might incorporate the reality of regional economic integration, exemplified by accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), into its thinking regarding immigration policy. CST's writing on the ethics of immigration policies tries to be responsive to transnational interdependence. CST acknowledges the relationship between interdependence and increased transnational migration, but does not provide comprehensive guidance as to how the relationship between the right to emigrate and obligations to receive immigrants ought to be politically structured. This thesis makes a proposal that is meant to help CST expand the guidance it can give regarding the structuring of transnational rights to migrate and obligations to receive migrants. In dialogue with liberal thinking, this thesis suggests that CST can understand regional integration agreements as giving rise to special reciprocal rights to migrate and obligations to receive migrants. The works of several thinkers who have written on this topic are queried. First, the writings of CST are analyzed. The right to migrate in CST is understood as a geographic right of public access to goods. Second, the writing of Michael Walzer on membership is examined in light of his more recent work and statements. Walzer provides hints as to how non-citizens can end up being de facto incorporated into another country's political community. Subsequently, arguments for a robust global right to freedom of movement, put forth by Joseph Carens, are evaluated. Although these arguments are judged unsuccessful, Carens's focus on basic social institutions offers clues as to how CST might think about interdependence. These clues, with the help of Thomas W. Pogge's institutional conception of human rights, in which rights are understood as claims on institutional orders, are incorporated into CST's thinking. This incorporation gives CST a framework for understanding how and when regional integration agreements can lead to special rights to migrate across borders and corresponding obligations to receive migrants. The implications of this framework for state policy are briefly illustrated by examining transnational worker provisions under NAFTA and an immigration reform bill recently sponsored in the U.S. Senate.",305338239,,Dissertations & Theses," Llanos, Christopher G.LlanosG.ChristopherLlanos, Christopher G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251826571 , 34017921 , 66569 , 9780542935428 , 3239140 , 3239140", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542935428, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305338239?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Religion , Political science , International law"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Catholic , Freedom of movement , Human rights , Immigration policy , Public policy , Regional economic integration , Social thought",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Catholic+social+thought%2C+regional+economic+integration%2C+and+immigration+policy%3A+Reconstructing+Catholic+social+thinking+regarding+the+right+to+freedom+of+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Llanos%2C+Christopher+G.&amp;isbn=9780542935428&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"53,"Justice at the edge of the liberal state: Borderlands, transnational migration, and citizenship","In a world of interdependent states that exhibit increasingly overlapping memberships, states exert jurisdiction over citizens and non-citizens. Under these borderland conditions, constructing justice focuses on the border structure of the nation-state and the ways it distributes the benefits and burdens of social cooperation. My dissertation develops a critical perspective from within the borderlands, which depict changing conditions of social cooperation and membership within political communities as transnational contexts and relationships interact with the national state. Persons situated in borderland contexts exist between the domestic and the foreign, and negotiate their membership between alien and citizen. I focus on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, which have been patterned on transnational labor migration and historical interconnection across peoples, and argue that justice is a balance between the claims of those who are organized within domestic political communities, and those situated across them. Persons are potential transnational actors, who reconstitute ""peoples"" as they relocate across borders. I argue that justice frameworks are incomplete without an accurate understanding of borders as mediating institutions whose justice is to be assessed, not assumed. I develop the perspective of the borderlands to better approximate political communities, how they interact, and how this process conditions the choices available to persons. These constraints shape their reasonable claims, and therefore what constitutes fair terms. A borderland perspective includes the ""alien"" as a relevant social position within Rawlian justice frameworks and modifies them to include cross border movement between peoples. I argue for an alternate institutional scheme that provides localized ""borderland jurisdictions"" which enable fair conditions within and between liberal states that share systemic borderlands. A borderland jurisdiction allows localized crossings rights between spheres of governance. It recognizes a form of social association that challenges the liberal state and its integrative framework by arming smaller collective units which can challenge the legitimate use of coercive force. However, borderland jurisdictions also enable states to construct just borders that distinguish correctly between members and foreigners and determine a fair distribution of benefits and burdens by addressing the dynamics of dominance that emerge from the perennial problems states face when dealing with their borders.",305338624,,Dissertations & Theses," Gastelum, Yvonne AimeGastelumAimeYvonneGastelum, Yvonne Aime",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1253506221 , 33065791 , 66569 , 3245137 , 3245137", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305338624?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Borderlands , Citizenship , Justice , Liberal state , Mexico , Transnational migration , United States-Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Justice+at+the+edge+of+the+liberal+state%3A+Borderlands%2C+transnational+migration%2C+and+citizenship&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gastelum%2C+Yvonne+Aime&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"54,The Hypertext Solution: Digital media and contemporary international organization,"In this dissertation I develop a theory of international organization that I call ""The Hypertext Solution."" By using this term I mean to convey two basic arguments. Inspired by the so-called 'Toronto School' and its notion of medium theory, my first argument is that digital communication technology is transforming contemporary international politics by enabling the formation of what I refer to as a 'trans-national community'---a community comprised of individuals who are located in different nation-states but are more allegiant towards each other than to the nation-state which recognizes them as citizens. Building on the constructionist notion that the analyst is a social agent whose very practice of international theory can result in a reconstitution of the way international theory is perceived, my second argument is that the discipline's Three Debates can be recast as three interrelated problems, which I identify as substantive, ontological, and methodological in character. Each of these problems forms the basis of a chapter. In chapter one I argue that the contemporary era is marked by the presence of a trans-national community that is capable of imposing a modified version of audience costs. In chapter two I argue that the expanding use of digital communication technology represents an agential-inspired example of systemic change. And in chapter three I use public statements as a data-set and argue that it is possible to recover a government's strategic intentions for maintaining its governing viability by examining how it rationalizes its foreign policies. In the conclusion I outline a theory of foreign policy that promotes the establishment of an international institution comprised of liberal states, the free movement amongst G8 citizens, and a policy of economic engagement with non-liberal regimes.

Through blending and juxtaposing Moroccan musical genres and a variety of international and transnational genres, fusion musicians assert they are creating music that is simultaneously ""modern"" and rooted in Moroccan tradition. Fusion musicians are consciously attempting to redraw the boundaries of Moroccan popular music. Based on a consolidation of the research on Moroccan popular music and fieldwork in 2002, this work examines the emergence of fusion as a distinct genre. It looks at the cultural roots and influences from which it emerged, the social conditions that foster its growth (and/or hinder its progress), its coalescence as a musical movement, its musical characteristics, and the imagination that drives it. The dissertation also proposes a model for examining the emergence of musical genres that emphasizes the important and pivotal role of imagination. Imagination is an essential component of human existence: as Martin Heidegger pointed out, we live ""toward possibilities"", continually re-imagining what our lives might become. With art, these personal imaginings move into the social realm and become the imaginings of groups of artists, consumers, and fans. The imaginations that drive the creative work of popular musicians arise out of real historical situations. The habitus, life histories and social conditions create the possibilities and limitations within which popular musicians practice their craft. These possibilities and limitations also create the raw material with which popular musicians work as they try to articulate their own vision of the world.",305342526,,Dissertations & Theses," Callen, JeffreyCallenJeffreyCallen, Jeffrey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1216731701 , 34018781 , 66569 , 9780542796449 , 3226016 , 3226016", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542796449, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305342526?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0413 Music , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Music , Cultural anthropology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Fusion , Moroccan , Popular music",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=French+fries+in+the+Tagine%3A+Re-imagining+Moroccan%0Apopular+music&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Callen%2C+Jeffrey&amp;isbn=9780542796449&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"56,Popular education in Asia: A comparative study of Freirian legacies in popular education of the Philippines and South Korea,"The purpose of this study is to identify possibilities for democratic social transformation through popular education characterized by people's participation in the politics of everyday life. While recognizing Paulo Freire's crucial influences on popular education in Latin America, North America, Africa, Oceania, Europe, and partly in Asia, this study hopes to reveal the influences of Freirian pedagogy upon popular education during the 1970s-80s when the Philippines and South Korea struggled for democratization. Interviews with popular educators and social activists were conducted as the main method of data collection. Freirian pedagogy played a crucial role in popular education to promote social democratization in both countries. Comparing popular education in the Philippines and South Korea, I outline similarities and differences regarding characteristics, methods, and main fields. 'Church-related practices,' 'uniting with CO movements,' 'elite-led tendency,' 'failure to contextualize Freirian methods,' and 'disregards of the Left' occurred similarly in both countries. However, the importance of popular education has been relatively different in each region. In the Philippines, people's organizations initiated popular education more actively after 'the EDSA uprising' of 1986; however, popular education became sharply insignificant after the ""6.29 Democracy Declaration"" in 1987. South Korea, on the other hand, chose a different mode of social movement than the popular movement. Furthermore, Freirian legacies have been diffused to various socio-cultural domains such as school reform, social welfare, night schools (Yahak), labor struggles, and post literacy programs in Korea, while CO movements and organizations in the Philippines remain the main mediators of Freirian pedagogy. The differences come from very different demographic, cultural, historical, political, and economic situations between the two countries. Since its appropriation by intellectuals of the Philippines and South Korea, Freriean pedagogy in popular education has not properly been reflected in terms of how to re-create contextual theories and methods in each country. Therefore, it is more important to look for the implications of popular education inspired by Freirian legacies so as to understand Freire's ideal world, that is to say, humanization in the period of a global society. Having been influenced by Paulo Freire, the insistent struggles of popular education since the 1970s through the 80s will help to widen the room for critical pedagogy, to build peace relations through peace talks, and to promote the discourse of multiculturalism.",305343980,,Dissertations & Theses," Yoo, Sung-SangYooSung-SangYoo, Sung-Sang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1280147391 , 35961121 , 66569 , 3251509 , 3251509", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305343980?accountid=14496," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory"," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory"," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory",," 0534 Social studies education , 0998 Educational theory"," Social studies education , Educational theory"," Education , Democratization , Freire, Paulo , Korea , Paulo Freire , Philippines , Popular education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Popular+education+in+Asia%3A+A+comparative+study+of+Freirian+legacies+in+popular+education+of+the+Philippines+and+South+Korea&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yoo%2C+Sung-Sang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"57,"The politics of humanitarianism: States, reformers, and the international movement to combat the traffic in women, 1875–1960","In the late 1800s, the movement to combat the traffic in women brought together European and other countries throughout the world to address international prostitution. A concern of voluntary associations in Great Britain originally, the movement diffused as the associations internationalized and gained the interest of state officials around the world. Those involved developed international anti-trafficking accords that were incorporated into the humanitarian activities of the League of Nations (LON) and United Nations (UN) and signed by a variety of states. Which states cooperated to address the traffic in women and girls and why did they do so? Social science scholars interested in the formation of and adherence to international norms would view the diffusion of the anti-trafficking movement as the result of the successful creation of a global humanitarian ""moral order"" prohibiting the sexual exploitation of women. Through a comparative-historical analysis of archival materials from the involved international voluntary associations (IVAs) and the LON, however, I show that the issue of trafficking was initially raised as a humanitarian concern by one liberal feminist IVA that sought to fight the worldwide sexual exploitation of women and successfully usurped by another IVA that used a rhetoric of gender protection to frame prostitution in national terms. The latter approach appealed to states interested in increasing their power to define the boundaries of nation and empire. In addition to examining the overall construction of the movement, I also compare its diffusion in particular countries and the consequences for the implementation of anti-trafficking measures. The relative influence of the different IVAs and the varying importance of prostitution to specific state and nation-building projects in the Netherlands, France and Italy led to different applications of anti-trafficking measures in metropole and colony. Using the international movement as a case study by which to examine the politics of humanitarianism, this project shows that interests and ideology are not mutually exclusive in humanitarian efforts and that IVAs may in fact operate to increase rather than challenge state power. The anti-trafficking movement resonated precisely because it could be used politically to bolster territorial interests at a time of nation-state consolidation, imperial growth and rivalry, and the development of the interstate system.",305344190,,Dissertations & Theses," Limoncelli, Stephanie A.LimoncelliA.StephanieLimoncelli, Stephanie A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1196414821 , 34623381 , 66569 , 9780542768057 , 3224339 , 3224339", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542768057, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305344190?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Humanitarianism , International social movements , Politics , Prostitution , Reformers , Trafficking , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+humanitarianism%3A+States%2C+reformers%2C+and+the%0Ainternational+movement+to+combat+the+traffic+in+women%2C+1875%E2%80%931960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Limoncelli%2C+Stephanie+A.&amp;isbn=9780542768057&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"58,Japan noise: Global media circulation and the transpacific circuits of experimental music,"This dissertation is an ethnographic study of global media circulation that traces the transpacific exchange of ""Noise""--an emergent experimental music genre---between musicians and listeners in Japan and North America. Japanese Noise musicians have sold tens of thousands of recordings in the US, and helped to stimulate a significant American Noise subculture. Yet the dual reception of Noise as a ""Japanese"" music (sometimes labeled ""Japanoise""), but also as a universal avant-garde style relies as much on imaginary speculations as on actual exchange. But by its very name, Noise seems to question the transmission of meaning from one distinct cultural space to another: if ""Noise"" is ""Music,"" what, after all, is ""Culture?"" Listening to urban sound worlds connects us to circuits of technological change; to transnational media networks and the historical projects of the Western avant-garde, and to the representation of Japanese modernity in the multi-layered sonic experience of musical performance in its cities. Based in several years of fieldwork with participants both in Japan and the United States, my dissertation shows how separated individuals and sites of social production are linked together by recordings in cosmopolitan circulation. How do we expand modern frameworks of cultural politics, place, and expressive culture when we travel with recordings in their distribution? The movement of marginal and obscure experimental musical genres can reframe popular music's symbolic and social practices on many different planes. Through its translocal circulation, Noise becomes a mutable commodity, a cultural trope, an aesthetic tool, a force for social connection and an aspect of everyday life. This dissertation is a multi-sited study of this modern context of music circulation, which questions well-traveled concepts of art, culture, nation, and identity by working towards an interdisciplinary inquiry into the conditions of media's globalization.",305344785,,Dissertations & Theses," Novak, DavidNovakDavidNovak, David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251832091 , 32405901 , 66569 , 9780542916939 , 3237304 , 3237304", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542916939, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305344785?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0708 Mass media"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0708 Mass media"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0708 Mass media",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0708 Mass media"," Cultural anthropology , Music , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Circulation , Experimental music , Global , Japan , Media , Noise , Transpacific circuits",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Japan+noise%3A+Global+media+circulation+and+the+transpacific+circuits+of+experimental+music&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Novak%2C+David&amp;isbn=9780542916939&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"59,Transnational opposition and negotiation: Challenges to an oil pipeline in Ecuador,"The literature on transnational networks portrays transnational collaborations as advantageous to domestic stakeholders. Yet, the gains of transnational engagement may be accompanied by hardship for domestic groups. This dissertation examines how domestic stakeholders experienced the benefits and burdens of transnational collaboration in challenging the construction of the oil pipeline, the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados, in Ecuador. Four community cases along the pipeline's route were selected for analysis. Each case varied by the experienced externalities of the oil industry and distributive struggle with the industry and the state. Lago Agrio, an oil town on the edge of the Amazon, represented a community with 30 years of oil saturation that engaged the state to determine just compensation. The capital Quito represented the nation's environmental organizations that sought a role in directing oil-funded conservation efforts. The third site, the eco-tourism community of Mindo, mobilized to reject the pipeline's route near their private reserves and to promote eco-tourism as an economic alternative to oil extraction. The final site was Esmeraldas, a coastal community experienced in tanker loading and oil refining that achieved a collective dignity in pressing for community-determined compensation. To better understand the impacts of transnational activities, this dissertation synthesizes theories of social movements, environmental justice and development. In its longitudinal and case study design, the examination of one project at four sites of contention offers insight into how transnational mobilization drives or hinders environmental justice and how grassroots groups gain or lose a forum for participation. My findings indicate that transnational campaigns benefited locals by providing expert assessments, facilitating international access and influencing international financing policies. However, the unintended consequences included a focus on international concerns. Indeed, we see how some local issues (eradication of poverty) remain local, while others (environmental protection) are transformed into global concerns. The venue of dialogue, the target of contention, and community demands were experienced differently by case. Yet, the outcome of their engagement was quite similar. Challenges to the pipeline represented an opportunity for a diversity of domestic stakeholders to insert themselves into determining alternative uses for the nation's oil resources and advancing a more participatory democracy.",305345415,,Dissertations & Theses," Widener, PatriciaWidenerPatriciaWidener, Patricia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1273130681 , 34939431 , 66569 , 9780542830747 , 3227967 , 3227967", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542830747, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305345415?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure , 0791 Energy"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure , 0791 Energy"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure , 0791 Energy",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure , 0791 Energy"," International law , International relations , Social structure , Energy"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Ecuador , Environmental justice , Negotiation , Oil pipeline , Opposition , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+opposition+and+negotiation%3A+Challenges+to+an+oil+pipeline+in+Ecuador&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Widener%2C+Patricia&amp;isbn=9780542830747&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"60,"Transnational movements, human rights and democracy: Legal mobilization strategies and majoritarian constraints in Kenya, 1982–2002","What explains the emergence of human and democratic rights in historically authoritarian and dependent regimes? Based on interviews with movement leaders and participants, as well as longitudinal analysis of news media, and policy and movement documents, the study's central finding is that certain fundamental human and democratic rights became more widely recognized, practiced and protected in Kenya between December 1991 and December 2002 due to the political impact of a transnational social movement dedicated to these goals. This finding challenges central assumptions in dominant theories of human rights and democratization in political science. To explain the puzzles posed by the Kenyan case, the study puts forth a new theoretical framework that integrates state, societal and international levels of analysis, and builds on social movements and legal mobilization theories. Specifically the study argues for the analytical value of three social movements concepts---mobilizing structures, political opportunity structures and framing process---to explain movement emergence and development. To explain movement impact, the study examines how legal mobilization strategies enabled movement actors to: (1) sustain a common reform agenda and sense of collective identity among diverse movement actors; (2) increase citizen awareness of internationally and constitutionally recognized human and democratic rights, and the role of state institutions in protecting them; (3) facilitate institution-building at state, societal, and international levels to promote rights protections; and (4) ultimately force a resistant regime to concede important human and democratic rights reforms. Despite the impressive achievements of this transnational movement, the study also finds that at each stage of its development, majoritarian features of Kenya's Constitution constrained movement reform efforts. Particularly detrimental was Kenya's majoritarian electoral system. Not only did this system directly contribute to large-scale ethnic violence leading up to and following Kenya's 1992 and 1997 multiparty elections, but it also largely explains Kenya's protracted democratic transition. Based on evidence dating to Kenya's independence in 1963, the study concludes that the more closely Kenya's emerging democratic system approximates a liberal democracy with consensus, rather than majoritarian, institutions, the greater the likelihood that Kenyans' human and democratic rights will be promoted and protected by this system.",305346812,,Dissertations & Theses," Feeley, Maureen CatherineFeeleyCatherineMaureenFeeley, Maureen Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1176550791 , 33065761 , 66569 , 9780542720888 , 3220378 , 3220378", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542720888, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305346812?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Democracy , Human rights , Kenya , Legal mobilization , Majoritarian , Transnational movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+movements%2C+human+rights+and+democracy%3A+Legal+mobilization+strategies+and+majoritarian+constraints+in+Kenya%2C+1982%E2%80%932002&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feeley%2C+Maureen+Catherine&amp;isbn=9780542720888&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"61,Women weaving the dream of the Revolution in the American continent,"The U.S. third world women's movement proposes the Chicana new mestiza identity as a methodology of (post) modern social movements. García Canclini differentiates modern national identities from transnational citizens' identifications emerging from hybrid cultures' (post) modern consumption of cultural products. Drawing on the contributions and limitations of these two proposals, the dissertation examines the contrast between a masculinist and a womanist articulation of politics of mestiza community making in the Americas. This strategy bears relevance to the meaning of women's agency within the relationships between production and (re) production while providing visibility to the significance of sexuality politics if one wants to qualitatively change the notion and the practice of democracy. In the first part of this dissertation I examine the Mexican Revolution's politics of mestizaje through the study of anthropologist Manuel Gamio's inscription of the new Mexico. I introduce the Mexican Revolution politics of mestizaje as historical references both of Sandoval and García Canclini's mestizaje and hybridity frameworks, which these authors see as the methodological instruments of/for (post) modern social movements. In the second part of the dissertation, I conceive the framework that bridges the mestizaje that the Mexican Revolution consolidated and that the U.S-led. Pan-American project supported. I examine mestizaje politics as a common feature of Latin American politics of community making. At the middle of the twentieth century, when indigenist Pan-Americanism was projected to the entire continent, Venezuela consolidated the modern institutionalisation of its state and the oil production character of the nation. Mestizaje is again the center of this process of community making and is deeply related to the land that produces the resources of the nation state. After providing this historical and conceptual information about Venezuela, the third and last part of the dissertation focuses on the Venezuelan Wayuu Indigenous Women's movement. The study of this concrete social movement introduces new questions and answers on contemporary ethnic and women's politics in the Americas. These questions and answers re-introduce the importance of evaluating the political and epistemological consequences of sexuality and racial politics within social movements which become concrete revolutionary political projects. By studying the Wayuu indigenous women social movement within the Bolivarian Revolution's domestic as well as sub-continental community re-making efforts, the dissertation's objective is to provide evidence of the importance of sexuality politics within contemporary neo-decolonizing hemispheric political efforts.",305347034,,Dissertations & Theses," Angeleri, SandraAngeleriSandraAngeleri, Sandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1051281601 , 18222061 , 66569 , 9780542461194 , 0542461196 , 3200708 , 3200708", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542461194 , 0542461196", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305347034?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0344 Social research , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Womens studies , Social research , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , Mestizaje , Mexican Revolution , Mexico , Venezuela , Wayuu , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+weaving+the+dream+of+the+Revolution+in+the+American+continent&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Angeleri%2C+Sandra&amp;isbn=9780542461194&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"62,How to use sport as a tool to promote gender equity in Botswana,"Sport has the capacity to touch the lives of all people, regardless of gender, age, language, economic and social strata, geographic location, or cultural differences. The culture of sport has intersected with the women's movement to create an empowering environment for change. This particular research project is designed to examine and analyze what the international women's feminist sporting movement, in correlation with the Botswana national feminist sporting movement, has done in order to improve gender equity in Botswana through policy change and implementation. Secondly, this research project will recommend methods based on field research and study that can continue to improve gender equity through further policy change and implementation from the national level down to the grassroots level in Botswana by using sport as a tool. Although legislative and policy changes of the last three decades have effectively addressed some of the longstanding problems of gender inequity, many practices within female sport and recreation continue to mirror and entrench women's subordinate position in society. Discrimination on the basis of gender, race, culture and social class continues to persist in Botswana. There are and cannot be any short-term solutions.

Known as the Kunarac judgment, the ruling established precedence by prosecuting rape and enslavement as crimes against humanity for the first time in history. The ruling also marked the first time that rape had been prosecuted as a separate crime by an international criminal tribunal. This study investigates the context, timing and significance of Kunarac 2002 . It uses a constructionist approach to develop a comprehensive understanding of social forces that led to Kunarac 2002 . The study sheds light on processes of social problem construction that generated social change through legal policy reform and its enforcement in an international war crimes tribunal. Designed as a historical case study, it culls information from written documents, fieldwork, and interviews with eighteen journalists, legal experts, women rights advocates, and Tribunal staff. I propose that historical and legal context are key to understanding the significance of Kunarac 2002 . I demonstrate that despite legal restrictions, war rape has been committed with impunity throughout history. To explain prevalence, I suggest that rape serves reward, terror, and revenge purposes and can function as a component of ethnic cleansing and genocide policies. The study finds that news media coverage, global-wide feminist mobilization against gender violence, and the presence of women in senior-level positions at the Tribunal were important to the timing of Kunarac 2002 . These findings contribute to the constructionist literature on social problems and support political process models that recognize the importance of indigenous organizations and coalition networks in the development of social movements. The findings also support research on the contributions women have made to the development of international law on gender crimes.",305354480,,Dissertations & Theses," Zoltanski, Jennifer L.ZoltanskiL.JenniferZoltanski, Jennifer L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1105016561 , 33191791 , 66569 , 9780542574344 , 0542574349 , 3208676 , 3208676", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542574344 , 0542574349", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305354480?accountid=14496," 0627 Criminology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0453 Womens studies"," 0627 Criminology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0453 Womens studies"," 0627 Criminology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0453 Womens studies",," 0627 Criminology , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0453 Womens studies"," Criminology , International law , International relations , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Crime against humanity , Former Yugoslavia , International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , Kunarac 2002 , Prosecution , Rape",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+construction+of+rape+as+a+crime+against+humanity%3A+Recognition+and+prosecution+by+the+International+Criminal+Tribunal+for+the+Former+Yugoslavia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zoltanski%2C+Jennifer+L.&amp;isbn=9780542574344&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"64,The myth of the addicted army: Vietnam and the modern War on Drugs,"Drawing on a wide range of archival research, media, legal and cultural sources, as well as personal interviews with veterans and government officials, the ""Myth of the Addicted Army: Vietnam and the Modern War on Drugs"" focuses on the trans-national roots of U.S. narcotics policy during the Vietnam War era and its international implications. During the 1960s, an explosive public debate emerged in the U.S. surrounding the addiction of American soldiers in Vietnam, which media commentators, social activists and members of both major parties linked to a breakdown in fighting performance. These claims were often inflated for political reasons, particularly among members of the anti-war movement who pointed to the alliance between the Central Intelligence Agency and warlords in the Golden Triangle region implicated in the narcotics traffic. The lone dissent came from military psychiatrists closest to the situation. Under intense political pressure and seeking to deflect attention away from the failure of his foreign policy in Indo-China, President Richard M. Nixon initiated a major escalation of federal drug control efforts both in the domestic and international sphere. The legacy of Vietnam remained salient in fuelling the extension of the modern drug war during the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations, due in part to the influence of Hollywood films like Apocalypse Now in preserving the myth that rampant drug abuse had contributed to a decline in the military's fighting efficiency and the waning of American global power. The War on Drugs was accordingly embraced through the 1980s and beyond as a pivotal policy-measure capable of protecting vital American security interests and preserving the nation's superpower standing. ""The Myth of the Addicted Army"" provides an original perspective in analyzing the historical resonance of the drug issue in the United States, and its link to deeper social anxieties bred by the Vietnam War. Innovative in combining archival research with cultural and media analysis, the thesis further examines the unintended foreign implications of the War on Drugs, which often encountered intense localized opposition and resistance, while exacerbating internecine hostilities and conflict in countries like Colombia, Mexico, Burma (Myanmar) and Peru, in part by arming repressive state policing agents.",305355280,,Dissertations & Theses," Kuzmarov, JeremyKuzmarovJeremyKuzmarov, Jeremy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1095442461 , 33063441 , 66569 , 9780542563355 , 0542563355 , 3208225 , 3208225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542563355 , 0542563355", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305355280?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0627 Criminology"," 0337 American history , 0627 Criminology"," 0337 American history , 0627 Criminology",," 0337 American history , 0627 Criminology"," American history , Criminology"," Social sciences , Addiction , Army , Drugs , Vietnam , War on Drugs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+myth+of+the+addicted++army%3A++Vietnam+and+the+modern+War+on+Drugs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kuzmarov%2C+Jeremy&amp;isbn=9780542563355&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"65,Women on -lookers: Transnational feminist documentaries and the new women's diaspora,"This project is an analysis of the multi-vocality of images and voices presented by transnational feminist documentary filmmakers in their films about migrant women and the current women's diaspora that began in the late 20 th century. Using an interdisciplinary framework, this project fuses feminist theories and rhetorical analysis to analyze the director's visual rhetorics and cinefeminist practices in the following films: Ursula Biemann's Remote Sensing (2001); Nilita Vachani's When Mother Comes Home for Christmas... (1996); and Lourdes Portillo's Senorita Extraviada: Missing Young Woman (2001). There are two overlapping questions that inform this project. Considering the powerful operational global economic shifts and emerging social practices within the language of mass media images, how do women documentary filmmakers challenge the social practices of dominant visual rhetorics without reinscribing them? And how do they account for the global flow of women migrants as nannies, factory workers, and sex workers in a way that acknowledges both their agency and the influence of global capital on their movements and lifestyle? The transnational feminist directors in this study challenge nationalistic as well as international social policies that determine women's identities and also question shifting economic trends that create new but often dangerous and illicit opportunities for migrant women. These three films offer insight into the condition of women migrants and women workers in the last ten years and discuss trends in global economics that sexualize women's work. Informed by a nonessentialist feminist approach to their women subjects, the feminist documentarians here can be defined by their self-reflexivity, challenge to binary terms embedded in global capital, alternative aesthetic practices, participation in transnational feminist networks, and counters to victimization narratives. Ursula Biemann, Nilita Vachani, and Lourdes Portillo's work simultaneously critiques the gendering of both global capitalism and documentary, and challenges the disciplinary bounds of film practices by utilizing political filmmaking practices to visualize women subjectivities in opposition to the overdetermination of women's bodies in Western media. The framework for close readings presented here is mainly a film/art historical approach. The chosen elements analyzed are voice and sound, narrative, editing sequences, and cinematography. This project redresses how overmediation invisibilizes women subjects and demonstrates some of the complex meaning(s) of migrant women's lives.",305355300,,Dissertations & Theses," Greene, CherylGreeneCherylGreene, Cheryl",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1126793191 , 33442271 , 66569 , 9780542590054 , 0542590050 , 3210141 , 3210141", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542590054 , 0542590050", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305355300?accountid=14496," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0900 Motion pictures , 0453 Womens studies"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0900 Motion pictures , 0453 Womens studies"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0900 Motion pictures , 0453 Womens studies",," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0900 Motion pictures , 0453 Womens studies"," Rhetoric , Composition , Motion pictures , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Documentaries , Feminist , Transnational , Women's diaspora",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+on+-lookers%3A+Transnational+feminist+documentaries+and+the+new+women%27s+diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Greene%2C+Cheryl&amp;isbn=9780542590054&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"66,The World Social Forum vision: Radical democracy vs. neoliberal globalization,"The well known phrase ""There is no alternative"", attributed to Margaret Thatcher, suggests that there is no alternative to the liberal democratic, free market system. Against this position, activists at the World Social Forum (WSF) assert ""Another World is Possible"". The following research investigates the question: what alternative visions of development are proposed by the global justice movements at the World Social Forum? I argue that the WSF movements advance radical democracy as the main alternative to ""neoliberal globalization"". In discussing this argument, this thesis reviews the literature on prominent theories of globalization, development and social movements. I then look at the alternative documents presented at the 2002 World Social Forum. I argue that the documents present three basic versions of an alternative vision, which I have named Participatory Democratic Statism, the Southern Front and Autonomism. Despite their differences, I conclude all the alternatives converge in advocating that civil society movements, not the market or the state, should constitutively be the center of a new form of development. A civil society oriented development is one in which citizens, participating as peers, democratically deliberate on all major social decisions. Hence radical democracy is the essential alternative theory of development proposed by the movements at the World Social Forum.",305357371,,Dissertations & Theses," Ponniah, ThomasPonniahThomasPonniah, Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1127200011 , 32999911 , 66569 , 9780542578175 , 0542578174 , 3209389 , 3209389", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542578175 , 0542578174", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305357371?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology",," 0366 Geography , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," Geography , Cultural anthropology , Sociology"," Social sciences , Democracy , Globalization , International development , Neoliberal , Nongovernmental organizations , Social movements , World Social Forum",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+World+Social+Forum+vision%3A+Radical+democracy+vs.+neoliberal+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ponniah%2C+Thomas&amp;isbn=9780542578175&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"67,"Crossed paths to Eden: Transnational environmental politics and the Amazon Alliance, 1990–2004","This dissertation is an historical ethnography of the Amazon Alliance, a coalition that originated from a 1990 meeting between Amazonian indigenous groups and US environmental and human rights NGOs (non-governmental organizations). The author traces the development of this coalition from 1990 to 2004 through document analysis and archival review, participant observation, and over thirty in-depth interviews with key informants and coalition members. The study departs from others of its kind in that the focus does not rest exclusively on the local movement as it engages with other actors in a larger network, but on the northern advocacy base for a marginalized population in the South. The major aims of this research were to (1) understand the genesis of the Amazon Alliance, and (2) explain one of its major developments, that is, the departure of the major conservation groups from the coalition despite their early enthusiasm and participation. In pursuing these goals, the author draws a more complex picture of a transnational network in which larger cultural, economic and political contexts interact with the micro-politics of inter-personal ties and decision-making. The author highlights a series of institutional, personal and ideological mismatches among the US NGOs and between the NGO and indigenous members upon which the coalition was originally built, but which came to the fore under conditions of financial scarcity and organizational strain. The study contributes to recent geographical and anthropological theorization of scalar ""entanglements"" by applying the idea to transnational networks among northern environmental and human rights activists and their indigenous allies. The concept avoids the static binary between ""the local"" and ""the global"" and highlights the relational aspect of transnational politics. The research illustrates how transnational politics are informed by people's localized experiences and histories, by their relationships to other transnational and local agents, and by the larger structures and contexts that impact the opportunities available to environmental and indigenous rights activists. The transnational networks that so many social movements seek to access in order to expand their reach and demand redress are uneven, unstable, and thoroughly ""entangled"" social landscapes shaped by power and struggle.",305357482,,Dissertations & Theses," Pieck, Sonja KatharinaPieckKatharinaSonjaPieck, Sonja Katharina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1127200001 , 32999911 , 66569 , 9780542578168 , 0542578166 , 3209388 , 3209388", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542578168 , 0542578166", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305357482?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Amazon Alliance , Environmental politics , Indigenous peoples , Nongovernmental organizations , Social movements , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crossed+paths+to+Eden%3A+Transnational+environmental+politics+and+the+Amazon+Alliance%2C+1990%E2%80%932004&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pieck%2C+Sonja+Katharina&amp;isbn=9780542578168&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"68,Essays on the political economy of international financial crises,"The free flow of global capital has been accompanied by destabilizing international financial crises. The political economy of such crises remain a largely unexplored topic. The essays in this dissertation examine the circumstances surrounding crisis resolution and consequence. Chapter 1 provides an overview, drawing together some central themes that underlie the methodological approach and investigation strategy. Chapter 2 seeks to clarify the channels and factors that influence the formation of post-crisis redistributive policy. It develops a theoretical model that captures the influence of domestic special interest lobbying and international bilateral bargaining on equilibrium lending, bailout, and reallocation decisions. The main predictions are: That post-crisis consumption of groups in the economy is dependent on whether the group is politically organized; and that lending decisions take into consideration both special interest pressures and political capital. Chapter 3 takes the theoretical model developed in Chapter 2 to the data, testing two key predictions of the model using both micro- and macro-level datasets. First, using household survey data for Bulgaria and Indonesia, it finds that political organization influences changes in post-crisis consumption expenditure. Second, using IMF lending data, it finds that political economy considerations influence the determination of actual loan packages. Finally, implications for international financial reform are examined in light of the model's findings. Chapter 4 (coauthored with Thorsten Janus) develops a model of social movement emergence and political change that is not critically dependent on active elite support, but rather on strategic interactions among movement actors as they are impacted by exogenous shocks, such as those experienced during a financial crisis. It then considers extensions such as multiple contracting mechanisms, informational imperfections, and elite involvement. Finally, the historical validity of the model is examined with case studies of Indonesia during the Asian crisis and conflict in the Congo.",305357660,,Dissertations & Theses," Lim, Jamus JeromeLimJeromeJamusLim, Jamus Jerome",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1158519561 , 33064561 , 66569 , 9780542705922 , 3219638 , 3219638", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542705922, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305357660?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0501 Economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0501 Economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0501 Economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Economics , International law , International relations , Essays , International finance , Political economy , Lobbying , Bailouts , Loans , Models , Polls & surveys , Interest groups , Economic crisis , Studies , Indonesia , Bulgaria"," Social sciences , Financial crises , International financial crises , Political economy , Redistributive policy , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+the+political+economy+of+international+financial+crises&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lim%2C+Jamus+Jerome&amp;isbn=9780542705922&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"69,A tale of two Shi‘isms: Lebanese migrants and Senegalese converts in Dakar,"Based upon extensive ethnographic research and historical sources, this dissertation is an ethnography of global religious movements and the localization of transnational religious institutions in Dakar. I portray the lives of members of three distinct religious groups and their interconnectedness: Lebanese Shi'ite Muslims can only be understood in relation to both Lebanese Christians and Senegalese converts to Shi'ite Islam. The Lebanese in Senegal have constructed their identities in response to a series of historical manipulations by global powers and continuous tensions between religion, ethnicity, race and nationalism. Lebanese migrants who arrived in Senegal as a religiously divided community of Christians and Muslims gradually integrated by uniting to form a secular afro-libanais ethnic group in reaction to French anti-Lebanese campaigns and Senegal's postcolonial politics of Africanization. The Maronite church became a model of an apolitical Lebanese organization that is accepting of religious difference. However, another identity shift occurred in the 1970s, when the Iranian Revolution energized Shi'ite Muslims around the world and a Lebanese sheikh arrived in Senegal. Dakar's Lebanese Shi'a were ""re-Islamicized"" and ""re-Arabized,"" where being Shi'ite meant having origins in the south of Lebanon and sentiments for national Shi'ite politics. A small Senegalese minority also began to convert from Sunni to Shi'ite Islam. Although influenced by the maraja (Shi'ite references) of Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, Senegalese Shi'a emphasize that their Shi'ism is distinctly Senegalese. Only through keeping their feet in both Sunni and Shi'ite worlds are Senegalese converts able to find their place in Senegal's politics of religion. I suggest that religious accommodation has little to do with religion per se. Race, ethnicity, social class and country of origin are far more powerful identifiers than Islam. This research not only rethinks the meaning and function of Islam in Senegal, but also reconceptualizes the conventional definitions of ""migration"" and ""conversion."" Furthermore, by emphasizing forces that affect migrants' lives beyond the sending/receiving country dichotomy, this dissertation argues that studies of transnationalism are Western-centric and too narrowly focused. ""Traveling Islam,"" the movement of people, books and ideas, leads to myriad ways to be transnational global Muslims, which can then be multiply localized.",305357997,,Dissertations & Theses," Leichtman, Mara A.LeichtmanA.MaraLeichtman, Mara A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1216728171 , 34936011 , 66569 , 9780542820298 , 3227874 , 3227874", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542820298, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305357997?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0318 Religion"," Cultural anthropology , Religion"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Converts , Dakar , Islam , Lebanese , Migrants , Senegalese , Shi`ite",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+tale+of+two+Shi%E2%80%98isms%3A+Lebanese+migrants+and+Senegalese+converts+in+Dakar&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leichtman%2C+Mara+A.&amp;isbn=9780542820298&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"70,"Literature and politics in the age of nationalism: the progressive writers' movement in south asia, 1932-1956","This thesis provides an account of the development of the Progressive Writersâ�� Association (PWA) in South Asia.Â  This body set itself the ambitious goal of mobilising South Asian writers and advancing the movement for independence by infusing it with social content.Â  As such it was inspired by movements in Europe but was also inextricably linked to social and literary traditions that had already been developing in India.Â  In this sense the PWA was embarking on a project for cultural hegemony that was as much a political and social movement as a literary one.Â  Consequently, the movement was not solely concerned with the questions of literature in a narrow sense, but also with the public and political role of writers in society, with which language the nationalist movement should foster and the popularisation of its cultural and political aims through theatre and film. Previous studies of the movement have treated it far too narrowly as a simple front for communist aims.Â  This was an important dimension of the movement that I account for but I see it as an attempt by some of the foremost intellectuals in the India of my period to shape the freedom movement and to project its vision for a wider society post-independence.Â  This thesis argues that the PWA embarked upon a project of cultural and political hegemony whose aim was to transform the literary and wider cultural landscape of South Asia.Â  It aims to demonstrate that the trajectory of this literary project can only be understood as part of a wider process of the global politics that were impacting on the intelligentsia.Â  This thesis is an effort to understand the specific motivations and factors that influenced writers in one of the most turbulent periods of South Asian history.Â  In investigating the interplay between literature and politics there is an assessment of the success and limitations of a cultural movement that aspired to hegemony.",898730375,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahmed, TalatAhmedTalatAhmed, Talat",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2487995681 , 45116391 , 101309 , U526218 , U526218", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898730375?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0332 History, History," 497787 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Literature+and+politics+in+the+age+of+nationalism%3A+the+progressive+writers%27+movement+in+south+asia%2C+1932-1956&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Talat&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"71,Analyse of Enterprises Social Responsibility and Competitiveness,"In recent years,  social responsibility of corporations is getting more and more attentions of business people and scholars of management. Since the mid-1970s, with the accelerated globalization process  and the continuous growth of multinational corporations, Enterprises increasingly became more strong in economic strength and the wealth of our society .And they also play a more and more important role in the global economy, political social life, science , technology, education, culture, arts and other fields , These trends led to that corporate social responsibility movement is steadily rising. Against this backdrop, a growing number of academics, and business people tend to agree with the corporate social responsibility of modern economic standpoint, that the corporations should take more responsibilities under a certain condition. Therefore, from the practice or theory, public has set higher requirements on enterprises. This makes enterprise managers  face a dilemma : While on one hand corporations must take certain social responsibilities in the trend  ; the other hand, enterprises are ultimately economic organizations, the manager must make profit for the shareholders,therefore the point of view that managers take corporate social responsibility as ""investment"" emerged. The purpose of writing this paper is to describe the theory of corporate social responsibility on the basis of Discussion on how to promote mutual relations corporate social responsibility and competitiveness of enterprises , and point out that enterprises' taking social responsibilitise is very important to promote the competitiveness. At the end of this article. i'd like to analyze the reason that why chinese corporations lack taking social responsibilities and how to improve this situation to promote the competitiveness of chinese enterprises. With the joining into the WTO, the domestic enterprises will enter accelerately the process of integration into international enterprises.

I use two backgrounds of political science: comparative politics and world politics. International Society theory is the basis of my research. On the basis of criticizing the structural idea of neo-realism and absorbing that of neo-liberalism and constructivism, I established a macroscopic political and social structure where political parties act, that is the complex structure of world politics. To be different from traditional international politics, I took in interior analysis of a country and bridged the gap among various actors from local authority to central government, inside to outside of the boundary and inter-governmental to non-governmental field. The action of every actor will be decided not only by material distributive structure, but also ideal structure. European region is a miniature of the complex structure. It includes almost all the key elements as well as mature even superior pattern. To more concrete, it includes civil society, nation states and European Union, which compose the first complex structure. Furthermore, citizens in Europe have advanced wisdom. They begin modernization and nationalization ahead of the whole world whiles also the first to start post-modernization and de-nationalization. They exploit a new non-governmental and transnational field and let us see the power of civil society. Civil society has three levels. They are local, transnational and global, which composes the second complex structure. I regard political parties as both dependent and independent key variables. European traditional parties are put into the first complex structure whereas new political parties the second. The former involves challenge from civil society, integration and Europeanization, European parliament and transnational political parties, etc. The latter involves post-modern Europe and globalism, global civil movement, non-governmental organizations, new political parties, etc. These two parts are the nucleus of my thesis.",1026735728, 欧洲区域社会结构变动与政党变迁,Dissertations & Theses," Tan, XueTanXueTan, Xue谭雪",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713483141 , 70569622 , 189128 , H283422 , H283422", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, Chinese, Chinese, 欧洲区域社会结构变动与政党变迁,2007,PQDT - Global,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026735728?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAIH283422 , Social sciences , 公民社会 , 政党 , 欧洲化 , 欧洲议会 , 社会结构 , 跨国政党联盟",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Transformation+of+European+Social+Structure+and&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tan%2C+Xue&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"73,Specifying fevers: Positioning Malaya's health lobbies (1867-1941),"This dissertation explores the roles of interest groups in the provision of medical facilities and the shaping of public policies in colonial Malaya. Business associations, medical missionaries, temperance movements and international health organisations were instrumental in financing and establishing medical facilities, as well as promoting public health issues and particular infectious diseases as flagships to define and platform larger socio-political agendas. Among the organisations included were the local merchant and plantation bodies, Anti-Opium Societies and social hygiene based organisations, the League of Nations and the Rockefeller Foundation. Their activities were situated within the contexts of health in the urban centres, plantation estates and rural hinterlands. In addition, these groups were visible in addressing social problems manifested through opium addiction and venereal diseases, and the crisis during the 1918 influenza pandemic. Collectively, these lobbies served to broaden the appreciation of the multi-layered interactions between health and society. The appropriation of healing functions by these non-medical organisations revealed a more pluralistic discourse on medicine beyond that of the medical practitioners or public health officials. Operating simultaneously at the local, regional and international contexts, the transnational networks of these organisations open up the possibilities of a more globalised perspective of health and medicine. The doctoral thesis hopes to historicise the phenomenon of non-government organisations in colonial Malaya, and to present new insights of the medical and socio-political contexts in which they operated.",1430890780,,Dissertations & Theses," Khiun, Liew KaiKhiunKaiLiewKhiun, Liew Kai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3066509471 , 81254972 , 189128 , 9781303419607 , U594392 , U594392", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9781303419607, English, English,,2007,PQDT - Global,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430890780?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0630 Public policy , 0769 Health care management"," 0501 Economics , 0630 Public policy , 0769 Health care management"," 0501 Economics , 0630 Public policy , 0769 Health care management",," 0501 Economics , 0630 Public policy , 0769 Health care management"," Economics , Public policy , Health care management"," (UMI)AAIU594392 , Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , British Malaya , Business associations , International health organizations , Malaysia , Medical facilities , Medical missionaries , Temperance movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Specifying+fevers%3A+Positioning+Malaya%27s+health+lobbies+%281867-1941%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khiun%2C+Liew+Kai&amp;isbn=9781303419607&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"74,The production and consumption of make poverty history's communications: a case study,"This thesis focuses on the production and consumption of the communications of Make Poverty History , a major episode of social movement protest that took place in 2005 in the UK.  Using qualitative methods, it follows the campaign throughout its cycle, which, at its height, had 540 member organisations representing 15 million people and had widespread support from within the political and celebrity elite. This thesis builds a theory of communications from existing social movement scholarship, bringing together elements of resource mobilisation, social psychology, new social movement theory, and political process theory, as well as media and marketing theory.  It highlights the overlooked role of negotiation in the production of protest and focuses on the audience to understand the consumption of mass movement communications. I look at the branding of Make Poverty History , emphasising the importance of branding theory and practice in the marketing of the campaign.   I unpack the tensions that developed around this branding, particularly the conflict between campaigners and marketers over the content of messages.  I show how attitudes towards government and political opportunities - whether to adopt a radical, outsider strategy emphasising protest or a moderate, insider strategy focusing on dialogue - influenced the production of communications. I analyse how these communications were understood by the campaigns three audience segments: the mass public, the interesteds and the activists.  I look at the long-term collective beliefs on global poverty and study how much the campaign managed to modify them.  I map out the diagnostic and prognostic elements of Make Poverty History's collective action frame on economic justice and confront them with audience reactions.  I end by looking at the campaign's relationship with celebrities and how this was perceived by the public. Throughout, my key objective is to analyse the problems facing a large, multi-group social movement as it attempts to mobilise its different audiences through its mass communications.",301694326,,Dissertations & Theses," Sireau, Nicolas ThierrySireauThierryNicolasSireau, Nicolas Thierry",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Hearing and studying these stories, I set out to develop educational strategies that could move other Canadians from concern to action on international human rights. Given the relative privilege of Canadian Amnesty International activists, these educational strategies constitute a pedagogy for the privileged. This study included a review of the literature on adult learning and social movements, semi-structured interviews with 18 members of Amnesty International Canada, the collection of a small number of write-in responses, and draws from my own experience as an activist/educator with Amnesty International Canada. As a result, it is clear to me that individuals go through a process of learning about an issue (awareness) seeking a social movement and/or social movement organization that provides further information and opportunities for action (alignment), and then taking action (engagement). It is moving people from alignment to engagement that is the main challenge for fostering action on international human rights and the challenge this study addresses. Four educational strategy areas show the greatest promise: human rights education, film events, member learning, and international service learning.

The underlying assumption of this dissertation is that TSMOs face complex and dynamic internal and external pressures, which test their organizational viability over time. In order to maintain their viability, TSMOs have to build adaptive capacity , the ability to repeatedly and reliably develop strategic responses to change. I challenge the emerging consensus in the social movement and organizational literatures that a decentralized and informal structure provides an adaptive advantage for TSMOs. Instead, I propose that different structural configurations can result in distinct and equally viable approaches to building adaptive capacity. I focus on two TSMOs, Friends of the Earth International (FoEI) and Greenpeace. Whereas FoEI has a decentralized and informal structure, Greenpeace has a relatively more centralized and formalized structure. However, FoEI and Greenpeace both exhibit organizational viability based on evidence including their income level and membership. Therefore, I assume that FoEI and Greenpeace have built adaptive capacity, which can be analyzed by exploring their typical strategic responses to four key organizational challenges: (1)  tactical innovation , the challenge of creatively adjusting tactics to disrupt the status quo; (2)  managing external relations , the challenge of partnering with other actors or remaining independent; (3)  organizational maintenance , the challenge of securing resources in order to survive; and (4)  managing internal relations , the challenge of resolving internal conflict. FoEI, as a ' global grassroots movement ,' continuously expands its tactical repertoire; develops collaborative partnerships; depends on a mass voluntary base; and resolves conflict through participatory dialogue; which I label the Agility Model of building adaptive capacity. In contrast, Greenpeace, as a ' global campaigning organization ,' specializes in high profile, nonviolent, direct action tactics; predominately operates independently; secures financial support; and resolves conflict through managing for coherence; which I label the Resilience Model. I analyze these models, and conclude that FoEI and Greenpeace are hybrid systems and that other unique adaptive capacity models at the organizational and movement levels are possible.",304707013,,Dissertations & Theses," Timmer, VanessaTimmerVanessaTimmer, Vanessa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1335365251 , 36902851 , 66569 , 9780494268100 , NR26810 , NR26810", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494268100, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304707013?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory",," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," Social structure , Organizational behavior , Organization theory"," Social sciences , Adaptive capacity , Friends of the Earth International , Greenpeace , Transnational social movement organizations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Agility+and+resilience%3A++The+adaptive+capacity+of+Friends+of+the+Earth+International+and+Greenpeace&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Timmer%2C+Vanessa&amp;isbn=9780494268100&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"78,Le mouvement paradigmatique autour du phénomène des jeunes qui vivent des difficultés: L'exemple du programme Cirque du Monde,"The phenomenon of youth experiencing difficulties is an undeniable reality in the world's largest cities. It has given rise to numerous measures running the gamut from protective to repressive. This article thesis examines the phenomenon from an international and transdisciplinary viewpoint through a social action model offering circus workshops to these young people: the Cirque du Monde (CdM) program. An example of an emerging alternative current, CdM was chosen for this study because of its potential to shed light on the phenomenon of youth experiencing difficulties as well as on the paradigmatic universe that surrounds it, in an ever-changing context. An interpretive and comprehensive single case study-type qualitative approach was used. With respect to methodology participatory and direct observations and semi-directive interviews were favoured. The work was enriched through an ongoing search of the literature on the policies of youth-oriented international organizations (IO), measures developed for youth and documents written by or about CdM. Iteratively, the approach and the analysis framework were inspired by a wide and diverse body of work. To understand CdM's approach, its individual and societal impact and its role within the paradigmatic continuum, three dimensions of the paradigm (theoretical basis, social representations and acting ) were examined in the different environments (IOs and regions of the world) concerned with the phenomenon, and then within the CdM program through the Atikamekw Nation and Mexico projects, in a passage of the local to the global. The trandisciplinary examination of these three dimensions reveals the dominance of a classical paradigm, which is widespread and, in certain circumstances, imposed. At the same time, emerging approaches advocating ""another way"" (an autrement ) are part of a dynamic alternative current that is challenging the dominant paradigm, which shows signs of changing. The CdM program, through its two sites, reveals a message and a way of acting that stands out from classic perspectives and transcends cultural and disciplinary barriers. More holistic than fragmented, this way of acting is guided simultaneously by the individual, the social and the pedagogy of the circus. The circus model reveals itself as not only a program targeting change, but as a transformation site stricto sensu , able to reconcile, through young people, opposing ideas: marginal-normal; particular-universal, prescriptive-emancipating. From this viewpoint, CdM, in addition to being one of the expressions of an emerging alternative current, is also a part and parcel of a more general paradigmatic movement evolving around the phenomenon of youth experiencing difficulties.

The attitudes of Roman Catholics toward these problems are explored through secondary analysis of Canadian statistical data and qualitative interviews. Chapter IV provides a typology of six North American Roman Catholic theological attitudes based on a review of major doctrinal disputes within the Church and personal interviews performed by the author in 2006. Participants were asked questions concerning the shortage of priests, ordination for women, priestly celibacy, homosexuality and reproductive rights. Their answers could be categorised according to their theological views and by their involvement within Roman Catholic lay movements. All respondents believed it is their responsibility to instruct the hierarchy on social issues. Chapter V discusses the internal debate within the Roman Catholic women's ordination movements. Some ordination activists seek to protect the hierarchical form of church governance, while others call for deconstruction of that hierarchy. Furthermore, the sensational ""River Ordination Movement"" has caused further strain due to the resulting excommunications and Vatican pressure on progressive lay movements. As debate intensifies, the focus of the women's ordination movement is evolving from a liberal feminist movement to a radical feminist movement as prescribed by theologians Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza and Rosemary Radford Reuther at the 2005 Women's Ordination Worldwide international conference in Ottawa, Canada.",304716269,,Dissertations & Theses," Baumann, BrittBaumannBrittBaumann, Britt",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1375508191 , 37354831 , 66569 , 9780494286685 , MR28668 , MR28668", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494286685, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304716269?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory",," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," Religion , Womens studies , Organizational behavior , Organization theory"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+women%27s+ordination+movement+and+related+disputes+within+the+Roman+Catholic+Church&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baumann%2C+Britt&amp;isbn=9780494286685&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"80,From monologue to dialogue: The Internet and the changing face of Iranian identity,"This study demonstrates the role of the internet in creating new political and social spaces which are circumventing the repressive Iranian regime.

The current repressive policies employed by Iran's conservative establishment are radical deviations from international standards on freedom of expression. Thus, this study will show how mass innovation under the auspices of the open source movement is bridging social and cultural gaps between those in Iran and abroad, alleviating the censorship apparatus, introducing democratic principles to the Iranian culture, changing the socio-political culture of Iranians, and remobilizing the debate on Iranian identity politics.",304719551,,Dissertations & Theses," Motahari, SalarMotahariSalarMotahari, Salar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1335365241 , 35857891 , 66569 , 9780494272268 , MR27226 , MR27226", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494272268, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304719551?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass media"," 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass media"," 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass media",," 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass media"," Social structure , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+monologue+to+dialogue%3A++The+Internet+and+the+changing+face+of+Iranian+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Motahari%2C+Salar&amp;isbn=9780494272268&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"81,Against the new enclosures: Communicational insurgencies as practices of anti-fear,"This dissertation examines the communicational dimensions of fear in neoliberal globalization, focusing on the problem of democracy when fear becomes the major lexicon and practice of politics. This study seeks to demonstrate how socio-cultural fear not only produces both fearful people and terrifying forms of political repression but also vital practices of anti-fear. The refusal of top down political fear, I argue, became increasingly significant in oppositional cultural practices in the context of the new enclosures of neoliberal globalization. Situated in the ""long 1990s"", between the enormous social upheavals following 1989 and the launching of the ""War on Terror"" in 2001, my dissertation proposes two lines of theoretical and methodological renovation. The first is based on a critique of the tendency to analyze communication processes as a problem of technology and argues for the importance of looking at communication from the perspective of the protagonists of culture. The second renovation tackles the totalizing, top-down tendency that predominates in much of the fear scholarship where fear itself is treated as a complete cultural project. This problem is exemplified in the fear literature's neglect of social agency—the diverse strategies of contestation and insubordination that have always confronted the politics of fear. I argue that this inadvertently reproduces the dominant political use of fear because people, in this view, are not the protagonists of culture but receptacles of it. To think about practices of anti-fear from the perspective of the protagonists of culture, I develop the concept of ""communicational insurgencies"" to theorize the role of communication politics in contemporary anti-enclosure movements. Drawing on examples from Vancouver, Los Angeles, New York and Ciudad Juarez, I use a grounded approach to analyze some of the ways in which the circulation of fear is contested and how this refusal is also an affirmation of dignity, democracy and social justice.

In many cases, industrialized agriculture produces negative social and ecological effects. In response to the exploitive practices of industrialized agriculture, a number of counter movements emerged in the mid twentieth century, including the organic farming movement. The principles and practices of organic agriculture presented an alternative form of food production, distribution and consumption that accounted for the social and ecological costs associated with feeding mass populations. Over the last twenty years, the organic food sector has seen phenomenal growth, that challenges organic's status as a counter-movement. Food safety issues have emerged the industrialized, globalized food system prompting concerned consumers to seek alternatives, contributing to organic food's rapid market expansion. As a result of its remarkable market growth, new actors have entered the organic food sector and organic food is now part of policies and regulatory frameworks of many OECD countries. Changes in both the structure of the organic food sector and the actors involved in it have challenged organic's standing as a counter-movement to the industrialized food system, and what it means for a food to be defined as 'organic'. This thesis examines the changing political economy of the organic food sector in Canada and the US over the past twenty years. It looks at the corporatization of the organic food sector and the insertion of organic into various levels of governance, including national policy-making agendas and global trade agreements. As a result of these changes it is argued that organic has fundamentally moved away from its original status as a challenge to the status quo, and is now part of the global food regime that it once so adamantly opposed and sought to replace. By examining the pressures for changing the social and ecological principles of the organic movement, it is shown that it has effectively shifted from a social movement to an advocacy network.

Since the 1980s this struggle has taken the form of a conflict over the privatization of water resources. Access to and control of water supplies are issues defined by the prevailing private property relations that comprise the global economy–those characterized by the preeminence of transnational corporate private property. Neoliberal policies, introduced throughout the world, have facilitated transnational corporate control over all aspects of economic and social reproduction, thus subordinating all forms of rights to the corporate form. This change in regulating power has led to significant questions arising from the implications of the commodification and privatization of fresh water. In reaction to these changes an increasingly organized movement is growing to resist this latest example of the enclosure of the commons.

Since the FARC-EP is such a significant power within the global context, it is important to analyze whether the methods and activities employed by the FARC-EP have the potential to create conditions for a genuinely emancipatory transformation of Colombia. Compared to other Latin American countries, little sociopolitical analysis has been given to Colombia by Latin American specialists. Virtually no in-depth scholarship has been offered concerning the FARC-EP as a contemporary social movement. The dissertation therefore evaluates the theoretical composition of the insurgency as a unique movement merging two seemingly different models toward social change; social movement theory and Marxism-Leninism. While being described as a revolutionary social movement—a label that has a historic connection to post-Marxism for it does not reflect a traditional view of the industrial proletariat as the exclusive strata that will eliminate capitalism—the FARC-EP maintains attributes distinctly connected to the classical Marxist tradition. Clearly not an urban working-class movement, the FARC-EP does concede that taking state power is an essential tactic in creating social change. Like many Latin American social movements, the FARC-EP is primarily peasant-based but, unlike social movement theory, the insurgency sustains a position that the ‘Party’ is essential in creating a new socialist society. Rather than characterizing the FARC-EP as belonging to one specific ‘camp,’ the dissertation illustrates how the insurgency movement uniquely amalgamates characteristics of both Marxism-Leninism and social movement theory. The dissertation then raises the question of whether the FARC-EP can assist in the creation of a social and political revolution of, by, and for the majority of Colombians. The study examined the southwestern region of Colombia, where the FARC-EP not only arose but has been present for several decades. Since this part of the country has the greatest historic and contemporary attachment to the FARC-EP, it is believed that examining the southwest best measured the insurgency's true intentions.",304730116,,Dissertations & Theses," Brittain, James J.BrittainJ.JamesBrittain, James J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1967054351 , 48299541 , 66569 , 9780494565483 , NR56548 , NR56548", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494565483, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304730116?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure," Social structure , Social change , Rural areas , Colombia"," Social sciences , Colombia , FARC , Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas , Revolutionary , Rural communities , Social change",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Change+in+the+countryside%3A++An+examination+of+pre+-revolutionary+and+revolutionary+social+change+within+southwestern+%28rural%29+Colombia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brittain%2C+James+J.&amp;isbn=9780494565483&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"85,It wasn't just bowling on Wednesdays: Ins and outs of engagement in radical activism,"This thesis is an analysis of the experiences of young women living in North America who have been involved in radical anti-capitalist social movements. It is a reflection on how our political perspectives have formed, and what experiences in our lives have inspired or enraged us to act. This thesis explores these questions in relation to movements for social change, by examining the ways in which local struggles for social change mediate the dialogic relationship between a person's identity and larger global and historical forces. The research first focuses on their individual stories of questioning imposed or expected identities, and coming to have a different sense of who they are and what they want. It then moves away from biographical narrative to reflect on reproduction of systems of domination and dynamics of inclusion and exclusion within movements, and how these dynamics influenced participants' continued participation or decisions to disengage.",304757326,,Dissertations & Theses," Thorndycraft, Joni BrookThorndycraftBrookJoniThorndycraft, Joni Brook",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1566663301 , 36961091 , 66569 , 9780494400296 , MR40029 , MR40029", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494400296, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304757326?accountid=14496," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0615 Political science , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0615 Political science , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0615 Political science , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0615 Political science , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Adult education , Continuing education , Political science , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology"," Social sciences , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=It+wasn%27t+just+bowling+on+Wednesdays%3A+Ins+and+outs+of+engagement+in+radical+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thorndycraft%2C+Joni+Brook&amp;isbn=9780494400296&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"86,An organizational theory of social movement success in a transnational context,"This dissertation proposes an organizational theory to explain the success of social movements. Coherent organizational structures within the movement, integrated organizing strategies to recruit new members, and autonomy from transnational networks lead to successful social movements. The theory develops through an extended comparison of a religious nationalist and a feminist movement in India. This model explains variation in success over time as it draws attention to organizational aspects of social movements. The major finding is that the success of a social movement depends on mundane community activism rather than networks of transnational activists or framing of ideas. Social movements that have clear channels of communication and cooperation among the various organizations that constitute the movement are more likely to be successful at developing a public agenda. Movements that invest time and money in local communities are better able to recruit new supporters. Their cooperative organizational structure enables them to match new recruits with appropriate organizations and activities so as to sustain commitment through engagement. Transnational networks are most important as sources of financial aid for Southern social movements. Fundraising based on individual contributions allows organizations to remain flexible and responsive to local communities. Fundraising through institutional donors runs the risk of agenda capture by transnational networks and fragmentation within the movement as a result of competition for funds. The data are drawn from fieldwork in South Asia and the United States of America. Interviews, primary documents of social movement organizations, and participant observation techniques are used. This study provides a framework to study social movements in comparative, historical perspective and addresses the more general question of successful social transformation. The study also provides practical implications for the management of civic associations that are part of a social movement.",304773220,,Dissertations & Theses," Deo, NandiniDeoNandiniDeo, Nandini",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1445049211 , 37531251 , 66569 , 9780549373582 , 3293404 , 3293404", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549373582, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304773220?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory , 0733 Gender"," 0615 Political science , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory , 0733 Gender"," 0615 Political science , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory , 0733 Gender",," 0615 Political science , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory , 0733 Gender"," Political science , Organizational behavior , Organization theory , Gender"," Social sciences , Feminism , India , Organizing , Sangh Parivar , Social movements , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+organizational+theory+of+social+movement+success+in+a+transnational+context&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deo%2C+Nandini&amp;isbn=9780549373582&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"87,Unclear path: Explosive remnants of war in Vietnam,"Much of the research on war and peace focuses on the consequences of war in wartime. My research merges the framework used to study war, feminist critiques of militarism, and social movement theory to understand the problem of explosive remnants of war (ERW) in the Quang Tri Province, Vietnam. I argue that the presence of landmines and other unexploded ordnance (ERW) blurs the boundary between war and peace for the individuals living in areas littered with these weapons. Specifically, I show the consequences of ERW on the civilian population and the response to the problem 30 years after the U.S.-Vietnam War was declared over. In my dissertation, I conducted in-depth interviews with ten ERW victims to investigate the consequences of the presence of ERW. Analysis of the interviews revealed individuals are affected physically, occupationally, economically, socially, and psychologically or mentally. To understand a response to the ERW problem, I use participant observation of and in-depth interviewing with the staff of Clear Path International. Investigation of Clear Path shows how victim assistance is conducted and the coping strategies developed by individuals engaged in this type of work. I also locate the work of victim assistance through the lens of the work of Clear Path in the larger social movement to eradicate ERW. ERW are a novel problem because unlike other social problems with plausible solutions, the ERW problem will exist as long as there are military conflicts. There are a few international laws regarding the use, development, and manufacture of these weapons and a strong social movement advocating for the elimination of ERW, however a permanent solution remains elusive.",304774126,,Dissertations & Theses," Smits, Sara ElizabethSmitsElizabethSaraSmits, Sara Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1407689641 , 38014171 , 66569 , 9780549243380 , 3281735 , 3281735", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549243380, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304774126?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Clear Path International , Explosive remnants of war , Land mines , Social movements , Vietnam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unclear+path%3A+Explosive+remnants+of+war+in+Vietnam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smits%2C+Sara+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780549243380&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"88,Figures in the May 1998 riots: Imagining the state in post -new order Indonesia,"Indonesia witnessed explosions of unprecedented urban riots in Jakarta and Solo from May 13 to May 15, 1998. The riots eventually led to a historic political transformation when the authoritarian regime of President Soeharto crumbled a week later. This dissertation attempts to understand how people use stories of the riots to imagine the state. It argues that the discourses of the riots extend beyond accounts of the violent event. They signify modalities of imagining the forces and limits of state power, depicting the state as a fantasized entity continuously feared and desired in post-authoritarian Indonesia. The dissertation elaborates three modalities of social imagination, embodied in three social figures found in the stories of the May 1998 riots. The first one rests on the figure of "" provokator "" (agent provocateur). In the stories of the riots, the figure emerges as a reminder of the state's authoritarian power which works on the border of legality and illegality. The second one presents the figure of ""ethnic Chinese."" The discourse of anti-Chinese riot proliferating in the transnational space of media and advocacy work draws on this figure to expose the fracture and limit of state power. The third one constructs the figure of ""victim."" The growing advocacy movement in post-Soeharto Indonesia to strengthen social justice and demand more accountability of the state over past violence has allowed the discourse about riot victim to emerge. This discourse mediates the desire among NGO activists to recuperate the sovereign role of the state to uphold law. I argue in this dissertation that the stories of the May 1998 riots found in media reports of the violence, in investigative documents of state-sponsored and NGO-sponsored fact-finding bodies, and in eyewitness accounts tell more than descriptive narratives of the event. Social actors work through the representational forms to illuminate ideas of the state with its imagined and fantasized power and presence.",304776640,,Dissertations & Theses," Thufail, Fadjar IbnuThufailIbnuFadjarThufail, Fadjar Ibnu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1404340861 , 36828741 , 66569 , 9780549198239 , 3278897 , 3278897", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549198239, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304776640?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Indonesia , May 1998 riots , Social conflict , Solo , Urban riots",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Figures+in+the+May+1998+riots%3A+Imagining+the+state+in+post+-new+order+Indonesia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thufail%2C+Fadjar+Ibnu&amp;isbn=9780549198239&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"89,"Crafting culture, fabricating identity: Gender and textiles in Limerick Lace, Clare Embroidery and the Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework","My thesis examines how identity was constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century amidst the growing possibilities of the cross-cultural transfer of ideas and products by analysing case studies of women-owned and -operated craft organisations: Limerick Lace and Clare Embroidery (Ireland) and the Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework (United States). I contend that the increased accessibility of print culture, travel and tourism, and World’s Fairs enabled the women responsible for these craft organisations to integrate a pastiche of artistic influences—those recognised as international, national, and local—in order to create a specific and distinct style of craft. The Arts and Crafts movement, with its ideas about art, craft, design, and display, provided a supra-national language of social and artistic reform that sought to address the harshness of industrialisation and to elevate the status of craft and design. The national framework of revival movements—the Celtic Revival in Ireland and Colonial Revival in the United States—promoted the notion that Folk and peasant culture was fundamental to each country’s heritage, and its preservation and renewal was essential to fostering and legitimising a strong national identity. I critically access the way these case studies, which were geographically separate yet linked through chronology, gender, and craft, operated within these international and national movements, yet they negotiated these larger ideologies to construct identities that also reflected their local circumstances. My intention is to unite social history with material culture in order to investigate the ways in which the discussion and display of the crafts, and the artistic components of the textiles themselves operated as a vehicle for establishing identity.",304777819,,Dissertations & Theses," Cahill, Susan ElizabethCahillElizabethSusanCahill, Susan Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1500088271 , 36647131 , 66569 , 9780494372647 , MR37264 , MR37264", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494372647, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304777819?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Ireland , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crafting+culture%2C+fabricating+identity%3A+Gender+and+textiles+in+Limerick+Lace%2C+Clare+Embroidery+and+the+Deerfield+Society+of+Blue+and+White+Needlework&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cahill%2C+Susan+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780494372647&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"90,"Genes out of place: Science, activism, and the politics of biotechnology","This dissertation examines the contentious politics of ""transgene flow""—the cross-pollination of genetically engineered (GE) crops with their unmodified crop relatives—by comparing struggles over GE corn in Mexico and GE canola in Canada. At stake are not simply questions of risk and safety. Battles over transgene flow expose fundamental tensions about economic transformations in the global food system, the ability of small farmers to protect their livelihoods and cultural values, and the freedom to choose what to eat and how it is produced. A transnational network of activists with roots in environmental movements, international genetic resources politics, anti-globalization struggles and indigenous rights movements have found common ground in their outrage over these examples of genetic ""contamination"" and their defense of non-GE agriculture and food. A central contribution of this study is the incorporation of insights about science and expertise into existing theories of social movements. For instance, experts have a key role in the ""boomerang pattern"" of transnational activism, not only as part of an epistemic community but also as mediators between citizens and national states. ""Citizen science,"" an activist-initiated process of data collection and analysis, plays an important part in the formation of activist networks and in the subjective assessment of political opportunity structure. Finally, legal mobilization affects the closure of scientific disputes, as judges use their authority to recognize or sideline activist challenges to scientific authority. Anti-GE activists simultaneously confront political and scientific authority, as regulatory decision making regarding biotechnology is increasingly ""scientized."" They respond to the scientization of state decision making in three main ways: (1) using scientific argumentation and forming alliances with scientific experts that support their arguments against GE crops; (2) claiming scientific expertise themselves, either through their direct experience as farmers or through activist-initiated scientific studies; and (3) seeking institutional venues in which it is possible to insert social, economic and cultural bases for decision making into the mainstream debate about biotechnology.",304780957,,Dissertations & Theses," Kinchy, Abby J.KinchyJ.AbbyKinchy, Abby J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1404354131 , 36831951 , 66569 , 9780549196518 , 3278785 , 3278785", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549196518, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304780957?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology," Sociology , Biotechnology industry , Genetically altered foods , Corn , Agricultural production , Canola , International , Food products , Farmers , Social activism , Regulation , Decision making , Scientists , Alliances , Studies"," Social sciences , Activism , Biotechnology , Canada , Genetically engineered , Maize , Mexico , Politics , Science",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Genes+out+of+place%3A+Science%2C+activism%2C+and+the+politics+of+biotechnology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kinchy%2C+Abby+J.&amp;isbn=9780549196518&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"91,Diasporic moments: Practicing clan in the Somali diaspora,"Studies of Somali kinship have predominated ethnographic research in Somalia. Remarkably, such studies among diasporic Somalis are conspicuously absent. This dissertation intends to fill this gap in the literature. This dissertation is an ethnography of everyday life in the Somali diaspora depicted through the lives of Somalis in Finland. My aim is to understand clan in the diaspora and to sort out why clan is an ever-present component of Somalis' daily lives. Somalis abroad and scholars in Somali studies tend to insist that clan is no longer relevant to Somalis abroad. Indeed, Somalis outwardly contest the notion that clan influences their lives. Somalis abroad are embarrassed by clan. They consider clan in Herzfeld's (1997) terms, culturally intimate. Somalis themselves blame clannism as the cause of the war and the continued civil unrest in Somalia. Perhaps because clan seems antithetical to modernity, diasporic Somalis deny significance of their clan affiliations even as they point out their own clans and those of their associates. I argue that scholarship on the Somali diaspora has been inhibited by the cultural intimacy of clan. An investigation into everyday life reveals Somalis' seemingly habitual efforts to cultivate clan networks. Given the role of clan in social networks, Pierre Bourdieu's (1986) concept of social capital provides an apt foundation to sort out why clan is ubiquitous in daily life. Diasporic Somalis manage transnational capital through clan networks: they use local and global clan networks in the moments of telling, movement, celebration, and crisis. Bourdieu's (1986) economy of practices is a framework that sees all of the forms of capital in place: economic, cultural, social, and symbolic. Clan's usefulness is what makes these seemingly habitual everyday practices become a durable pattern that resembles structure--over time and as the result of constant effort. Although clan networks offer Somalis prospects to build capital among kin, these networks also limit individualism. In the diaspora, Somalis encounter differing ideologies that compete with clan obligations and a hierarchical clan ideology. In Finland, Somalis consider their rights and obligations toward family and clan alongside Finnish autonomy and gender equality. Nevertheless, the diaspora offers Somalis unlimited opportunities to use clan in modern ways.",304781564,,Dissertations & Theses," Bjork, Stephanie R.BjorkR.StephanieBjork, Stephanie R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1394659311 , 37778711 , 66569 , 9780549208525 , 3279078 , 3279078", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549208525, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304781564?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Clan , Diaspora , Finland , Refugees , Social capital , Somali",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Diasporic+moments%3A+Practicing+clan+in+the+Somali+diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bjork%2C+Stephanie+R.&amp;isbn=9780549208525&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"92,"[E]motions, moments, and transnational connections: The lived experiences of two labour migrants in Canada's Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Program","Labour migrants have been routinely categorised within social scientific thought as either abstracted economic entities or as victims of global processes beyond their understanding. A striking majority of attempts to understand processes of migration, especially in regards to ""unskilled"" Mexican migrant workers, have been informed primarily by macro-level economic approaches, while the social and individual factors at play have been largely pushed to the side. As such, the social lives and individual diversities of these migrants have received meagre academic attention. In acknowledgment of this gap, this current thesis focuses on the lived experiences of Hector-Alberto and Durango, two individuals engaged in a cycle of migration as participants in Canada's managed migration program, the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Program. Through an ethnographic description of the everyday experiences of Hector and Durango, three relevant themes are explored: their individual relations to their work, their family, and their co-workers. As such, the present work aims to explore the varied experiences of migration and frame labour migrants as significant social actors rather than abstracted units or victims of social forces. The author encourages an engagement in a broader investigation of the ""migrant experience""; to look beyond the idea of transnational migration as simply physical movements across national boundaries, but rather as groupings of processes with profound and diverse meanings to those involved. Perhaps such a perspective would play a role in revealing the complex myriad of interacting processes which combine under the umbrella term of ""migration"".",304782546,,Dissertations & Theses," Ferguson, NelsonFergusonNelsonFerguson, Nelson",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1441257161 , 37704691 , 66569 , 9780494346228 , MR34622 , MR34622", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494346228, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304782546?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , Sociology", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=motions%2C+moments%2C+and+transnational+connections%3A+The+lived+experiences+of+two+labour+migrants+in+Canada%27s+Seasonal+Agricultural+Workers%27+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ferguson%2C+Nelson&amp;isbn=9780494346228&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"93,Internet use among social and political activists: A Kingston case study,"There has been much debate between enthusiastic and sceptical scholars about the role of the internet in traditional and non-traditional political organizations. The former argue that this medium benefits smaller, resource-poor and non-traditional organizations more than powerful, resource-rich traditional political parties. The latter hold that the internet, instead of levelling the playing field between traditional and non-traditional political players, reinforces the power of the existing, dominant political elites. Both perspectives by and large assume that the effects of internet technology are self-actualizing. To address this debate, this dissertation examines how the internet deployment affects political participation of social and political activists. It focuses on political party executives from constituency-level party organizations as well as social activists from several social movements in Kingston. More specifically, this work analyzes the fashion in which internet technology contributes to activists' political engagement and their attempts to widen the influence of their organizations. In addition, the thesis looks at the extent to which the net prompted activists' political initiation. The social movements on which this work concentrates are: Amnesty International (Kingston and Queen's chapters), Pesticide Reduction Kingston (PRK), the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG), and Queen's Project for International Development (QPID). The following political parties are analyzed here: the Liberal Party (federal and provincial constituency-level organizations), the Progressive Conservative Party (federal and provincial constituency-level organizations), the Canadian Alliance, the New Democratic Party (NDP), and the Green Party (Kingston Greens). The thesis maintains that internet technology does not have its own momentum and logic in shaping political outcomes. The study advances the argument that outcomes depend more decisively upon the use of this technology than on properties inherent in it. It argues that, to the extent to which the internet is enabling, it is conditioned by human choices, organizational context and culture. The study demonstrates that, while the centralized nature and the organizational culture of the political parties examined tend to restrict certain types of internet applications, it is the decentralized and networked culture of Kingston social movements which incites social activists to invest more effort in specific online strategies; namely, maintaining their websites, building activist networks, and generating participants' empowerment.",304784127,,Dissertations & Theses," Zizic, BojanaZizicBojanaZizic, Bojana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1335364851 , 36587141 , 66569 , 9780494266649 , NR26664 , NR26664", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494266649, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304784127?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media"," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media"," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media",," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media"," Political science , Mass media , Internet , Social change , Activists , Case studies , Kingston Ontario Canada"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Internet , Kingston , Ontario , Political activism , Social activists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Internet+use+among+social+and+political+activists%3A+A+Kingston+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zizic%2C+Bojana&amp;isbn=9780494266649&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"94,"The politics of Third World water privatization: Neoliberal reform and popular resistance in Cochabamba and El Alto, Bolivia","This dissertation is about the political economy of Third World water privatization and the dynamics of resistance to privatization in the water and sanitation sector in Bolivia. The study uses the tools of political sociology to examine how changing state-market relations affected the water sector over the past century, arguing that the development of the Third World ""water problem"" has been fundamentally related to the politics of international debt and the contradictions of capitalist development. It hypothesizes that the intervention of international financial institutions in the water sector during the neoliberal period has exacerbated social conflict because it has heightened the perception amongst social movement actors that water has been converted into a ""commodity."" These arguments are probed through an in-depth analysis of two case studies of failed water privatization in Cochabamba and El Alto, Bolivia. Based upon fieldwork in Bolivia between July 2004 and August 2005, the social struggles against water privatization are analyzed as exemplars of the processes that David Harvey identifies as ""accumulation by dispossession."" While most scholars have tended to portray the water wars as the reaction of ""new social movements,"" this study argues that contemporary struggles for water justice in Bolivia must be understood in the context of a long history of worker and peasant mobilization. United by a common desire for ""social control"" over the use of water resources, formal and informal workers and peasants built coalitions to defend a basic necessity of human life. After the water war, however, the coalition that once united diverse social actors in Cochabamba broke down due to a tension that emerged between the producers and the consumers of water services over the terms of public utility reform, as the consumers sought to cheapen wage goods and workers who produce these services sought to defend their wages and working conditions. Similar dynamics were observed in El Alto. In sum, this dissertation explains how different social movement actors, confronted with the government's neoliberal policies and the conditional lending practices of international financial institutions, have sought to resist the privatization of water and build democratic alternatives at the local level.",304785833,,Dissertations & Theses," Spronk, Susan JaneSpronkJaneSusanSpronk, Susan Jane",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1394678921 , 37710071 , 66569 , 9780494293430 , NR29343 , NR29343", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494293430, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304785833?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Bolivia , Cochabamba , El Alto , Neoliberal , Popular resistance , Third World , Water privatization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+Third+World+water+privatization%3A+Neoliberal+reform+and+popular+resistance+in+Cochabamba+and+El+Alto%2C+Bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Spronk%2C+Susan+Jane&amp;isbn=9780494293430&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"95,"Circulating commodities: The role of George Robertson, Edward Petherick, George P. Brett, and other publishers and distributors in the late nineteenth-century expansion of the international book trade","My study examines the development of the international book trade in English-language books between 1870 and 1895 and traces the business transactions of a number of publishers, booksellers, and distributors whose businesses spanned the globe. While an international book trade existed before the late nineteenth century, during this period a combination of different social, cultural, political, and economic factors forced publishers and booksellers in the Western world to look for and enter into new markets. Whereas previously international book sales were not a necessary component of success, colonial booksellers, distributors, and publishers, such as George Robertson and Edward Petherick, and British publishing firms, such as Richard Bentley and Son and Macmillan, sought to establish direct relations with each other in order to promote not only the sale of British books in the colonies but also the creation of editions specifically for the colonial market. Moreover, British, European, and American publishing firms had to negotiate with Robertson and Petherick in order to gain entrance into the burgeoning Australasian, colonial, and foreign markets for English-language books. The late-nineteenth century is a period of negotiation, collaboration, and competition as publishers, distributors, and authors increasingly looked beyond their own national borders for solutions to problems with book piracy and copyright that plagued the trade, as well as for opportunities to enlarge the sales of their publications. I analyze the theory and methodology traditionally used in Print Culture and argue that existing theory, such as Robert Darnton's communications circuit, often forces the history of print to fit into a national and synthetic mould. I argue that Pierre Bourdieu's field of cultural production offers a more contextual theory of book production and circulation; he examines the field of cultural production as the product of practices of fluid social networks and relationships. While Bourdieu offers a contextualized framework for the study of the international book trade, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari provide a vocabulary for clarifying the power dynamics of the trade that complements the unpredictable movement of books and people on the international stage.",304790829,,Dissertations & Theses," Rukavina, Alison JaneRukavinaJaneAlisonRukavina, Alison Jane",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1397899971 , 37830671 , 66569 , 9780494297315 , NR29731 , NR29731", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494297315, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304790829?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0509 Economic history , 0582 History"," 0298 Literature , 0509 Economic history , 0582 History"," 0298 Literature , 0509 Economic history , 0582 History",," 0298 Literature , 0509 Economic history , 0582 History"," Literature , Economic history , History , International , Books , English language , Market entry , Negotiations , Collaboration , Competition , Social networks , Studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Book trade , Brett, George P. , Commodities , Distributors , England , International book trade , Nineteenth century , Petherick, Edward , Publishers , Robertson, George",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Circulating+commodities%3A+The+role+of+George+Robertson%2C+Edward+Petherick%2C+George+P.+Brett%2C+and+other+publishers+and+distributors+in+the+late+nineteenth-century+expansion+of+the+international+book+trade&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rukavina%2C+Alison+Jane&amp;isbn=9780494297315&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"96,&lt;i&gt;Desde abajo y a la Izquierda:&lt;/i&gt; An ethnography of transnational activism,"Autonomist movements are unified across context through shared discourses of autonomy, direct action and radical democracy. Decentralized networks of autonomist collectives are responsible for the transnational activism often referred to as ""grassroots globalization"". This has largely fallen outside academic purview, however, as both marxist and liberal theoretical perspectives on social movements honour state-centric politics. Mobilizing the concepts of ""autonomy"" and ""counterpower"", this experimental, multisited ethnography (Marcus 1999; 2006) introduces autonomist politics and investigates how commonality is built upon asymmetry (Moore 2006: 447) and conversation across difference (Tsing 2005: 2) in transnational activism by concentrating on collaboration among autonomist collectives, anarchist movements, and indigenous movements at four ""moments of conjuncture"" (Tsing 2005: 272): (1) cooperation among anarchists and indigenous ecologists in Venezuela; (2) the transnational solidarity movement surrounding the Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca ; (3) solidarity activism with the Six Nations land reclamation in Canada; (4) the solidarity network of transnational Zapatismo. By tracing the practices of collaboration and listening to the palabra of participants for overlapping discourse and practices, the research exposes and analyses congruency and disjuncture among movements as well as among principles and practice therein. Findings highlight the intersection of race, class and gender in participation dynamics as well as emergent discourses. The conclusion argues that anarchoindigenism and related solidarity projects constitute an important ""conversation"" in the global anticapitalist movement; however, the secular and ""public"" nature of politics as constructed within political economy (i.e. anarchism) precludes radical solidarity with indigenous peoples and women most generally.",304795921,,Dissertations & Theses," Lagalisse, EricaLagalisseEricaLagalisse, Erica",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1441257201 , 37704691 , 66569 , 9780494347034 , MR34703 , MR34703", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494347034, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304795921?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0626 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , Sociology"," Social sciences , Venezuela",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Desde+abajo+y+a+la+Izquierda%3A+An+ethnography%0Aof+transnational+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lagalisse%2C+Erica&amp;isbn=9780494347034&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"97,"Investigating the impact of standards, high -stakes testing, and accountability on progressive social studies teaching","This dissertation focuses on examining the impact of the standards movement, high-stakes testing, and accountability on progressive social studies teaching. Specifically, this dissertation will address the following research questions: How do standards and high-stakes testing influence the development of the social studies curriculum in an innovative high school? How does the tenth grade Global History and Geography Regents Examination influence one teacher's practice in this school? What are the effects of standards and high-stakes testing on students? Since 1990, the standards movement and high-stakes testing have dictated educational reform in the United States. Evidence of this reform can be seen in New York State, in 1996, when newly appointed New York State Education Commissioner, Richard Mills, and the Board of Regents voted to overhaul the Regents testing system. As a result of this overhaul, new high-stakes Regents graduation exams would be required for all public high school students. By 2003, all New York State public high school students would be required to pass 5 high-stakes Regents exams to graduate. This dissertation will examine how one urban innovation high school grappled with the new requirements, and how it impacted the curriculum, teaching and learning of Global History and Geography. The theoretical framework for this study is progressive education as influenced and defined by John Dewey. The data collected for this study were collected through a twenty-week (one semester) qualitative, interpretive study in one progressive social studies teacher's classroom. A coding scheme was developed based upon grounded theory methods which indicated how the high-stakes Global History and Geography Regents Examination influenced curriculum, teaching, and impacted students. Analysis of the data revealed teachers, school administration, and students all shared a common view of progressive social studies, but found that the mandated Global History and Regents Examination compromised this practice and consequently compromised the mission of the school. From this study, it is clear that progressive social studies may not be able to co-exist comfortably with standardization, high-stakes testing, and accountability.",304801809,,Dissertations & Theses," Pearson, Marijo PhillipsPearsonPhillipsMarijoPearson, Marijo Phillips",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1273144801 , 35857201 , 66569 , 3245856 , 3245856", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304801809?accountid=14496," 0533 Secondary education , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching"," 0533 Secondary education , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching"," 0533 Secondary education , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching",," 0533 Secondary education , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curricula , 0727 Teaching"," Secondary education , Social studies education , Curricula , Teaching"," Education , Accountability , High-stakes testing , Progressive education , Social studies , Standards , Teaching",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Investigating+the+impact+of+standards%2C+high+-stakes+testing%2C+and+accountability+on+progressive+social+studies+teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pearson%2C+Marijo+Phillips&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"98,From servitude to dignity: Belonging in the ‘new’ Europe,"On November 19, 2002, the Prestige, a Bahamian oil tanker, sank some seventy-five kilometers off the Galician coast of Spain in the Atlantic Ocean with just over 77,000 tons of fuel oil in its tanks. The ensuing environmental disaster touched deep-seated anxiety about the status of Galicia in relation to the Spanish state and the region's economic vulnerability within Spain and the European Union more generally. This event sparked intense public debate about belonging and social justice in Galicia in the context of a social movement called Nunca Máis (Never Again). I argue that the environmental disaster as a ""critical event"" (from Das 1995) opened a public space in Galicia for claims to a shared community identity and debate about communal autonomy. Specifically, I examine the popular discourse of activists in Nunca Máis that predicted a cultural shift in the character of the regional community from ""servitude to dignity"". I focus on Nunca Máis activists' dominant interpretation of this cultural transformation, their interpretations of the environmental disaster, and their frustration with the governing Partido Popular in Galicia and Spain. My analysis of the popular interpretation of a community in transition from ""servitude to dignity"" shows that struggles are shaped by place-based and global action and these are envisioned in ways that are specific to local cultural traditions. While the devastating ecological catastrophe certainly played a role in helping to incite widespread popular mobilization, I analyse Nunca Máis in its historical context, that is, as one episode in a long-term struggle characterised by a vision of the need for change in the economic and political futures of the region. I demonstrate that the desire for a different figure in Galicia became possible through the Nunca Máis movement even though it used and perpetuated old social divisions and rhetoric to highlight the need for change.",304806107,,Dissertations & Theses," White, Amanda L.WhiteL.AmandaWhite, Amanda L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1467887601 , 38883111 , 66569 , 9780494361627 , NR36162 , NR36162", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494361627, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304806107?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Activists , Environmental disaster , Europe , Galicia , Nunca Mais , Social movements , Spain",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+servitude+to+dignity%3A++Belonging+in+the+%E2%80%98new%E2%80%99+Europe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=White%2C+Amanda+L.&amp;isbn=9780494361627&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"99,Social insurance in twentieth-century China: A global historical perspective,"This study analyzes China's social insurance movement in the twentieth century in global historical perspective. Social insurance is defined as an employment-related income maintenance system for old-age, sickness, unemployment, maternity, and work injury, but also viewed as the ""historical core"" of the welfare state. The global perspective of the analysis is a creative synthesis of Meyer's theory of world society, diffusion theories, and theories of the welfare state based on the experience of Western industrial democracies (modernization theory, neo-Marxism, and state-centered theories). The study argues that China's social insurance movement partially resulted from diffusion of competing world models of social insurance - the capitalist and socialist models - through interactions of global forces (such as the International Labor Organization, international advisors, and national polities) with Chinese national forces, for most of the twentieth century. In the 1980s, however, China switched to the mainstream world model provided by the ILO, and then in the 1990s to the neo-liberal model of individual accounts advocated by such global neo-liberal forces as the World Bank. While global forces provided the basic intellectual framework, national and local forces determined the timing and specifics of the adoption of social insurance programs. During this process, Chinese national forces contributed in turn to the development of world models of social insurance. Through the entire twentieth century, various Chinese governments stressed ""Chinese situations"" and ""Chinese characteristics"" whose essence was regarded as the Confucian heritage. These terms, however, were defined increasingly in terms of the competing global norms and principles. This study not only fills a major gap in Chinese studies, but also extends the theory of social diffusion and the study of the welfare state. It is based on research at China's Number Two National Archives at Nanjing, the Guangdong Provincial Archives at Guangzhou, and major libraries in the United States, Hong Kong and mainland China.",304815012,,Dissertations & Theses," Hu, AiqunHuAiqunHu, Aiqun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1432775611 , 38417641 , 66569 , 9780549333883 , 3289999 , 3289999", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549333883, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304815012?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0630 Welfare"," 0332 History , 0630 Welfare"," 0332 History , 0630 Welfare",," 0332 History , 0630 Welfare"," History , Welfare"," Social sciences , China , Income maintenance , Social insurance , Welfare state",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+insurance+in+twentieth-century+China%3A+A+global+historical+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hu%2C+Aiqun&amp;isbn=9780549333883&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"100,"Solving migration problems: Trans-Atlantic and trans -Indian Ocean approaches, 1890–1930","Since the late nineteenth century, the ""problem"" of long-distance migration has made migrants, their social networks, and institutions which promote or constrain mobility subjects of fact-finding missions and social science theorization. More recently, perceived disconnects between the ""global"" and the ""local"" in world history and between ""macro"" and ""micro"" level explanations of population movements in migration studies have led these two discourses to a similar conceptual position: ""mesolevel"" theories identifying social structures which connect parts of the world by channeling information, people, capital, and policy-making styles among them. Yet such calls for meso-level analysis have obscured the fact that a desire to investigate the relationship between migrants and transimperial, transoceanic, or transnational social institutions that may shape their possibilities, is not a new phenomenon. Using migrant travel narratives, shipping company promotional literature, immigration inspectors reports, colonial labor board archives, and early twentieth-century studies of the ""problems"" caused by international migrations, this dissertation illustrates how the complex interactions of migrants, non-migrants, former migrants, and possible future migrants have shaped directions and conditions of emigration and return across the Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins. In the early twentieth century national and imperial governments, as well as profit-minded transportation companies, sought ways to investigate, infiltrate, and alter existing migration-promoting socioeconomic structures that present-day analysts would label ""migration systems,"" ""networks,"" or ""migrant family economies."" Within an Atlantic-centered migration system, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Immigration dispatched immigration inspectors from Washington D.C. to Central European cities to investigate the relationships between migrants and the non-migrating individuals employed by transportation companies; while the transportation companies, including Hamburg Germany's HAPAG, attempted to increase their profits while alleviating public fears about the emigrants they were transporting. Across the Indian Ocean the bureaucratic structure of the British Empire cast migrant laborers and their living conditions as a source of debate and negotiation between native Indian politicians and labor recruiters, and the Office of the Protector of Labour in Singapore. Throughout, the dissertation argues that such transoceanic processes of intervention, expansion, and negotiation illustrate why the phenomenon of long-distance migration requires a mesolevel analytical approach.",304815365,,Dissertations & Theses," Trimmer, Tiffany A.TrimmerA.TiffanyTrimmer, Tiffany A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1372029691 , 37417511 , 66569 , 9780549079149 , 3270213 , 3270213", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549079149, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304815365?accountid=14496, 0582 History, 0582 History, 0582 History,, 0582 History, History," Social sciences , British Empire , Migration , Trans-Indian Ocean , Transatlantic",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solving+migration+problems%3A++Trans-Atlantic+and+trans+-Indian+Ocean+approaches%2C+1890%E2%80%931930&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Trimmer%2C+Tiffany+A.&amp;isbn=9780549079149&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"101,Local strategies in a global network: Disability rights advocacy in Jamaica,"The declaration of the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981 and the international activism of persons with disabilities resulted in the globalization of disability, which involved a new framework for the treatment of PWDs. Although disability activism was being played out globally, it has been about PWDs gaining equality and full participation in their local societies. Therefore, at the heart of an international movement was the strategic organization of PWDs, most of who live in the developing world. This dissertation is based on a case study of activism for disability rights in one particular developing society, Jamaica. The Jamaican movement is spearheaded by the Combined Disabilities Association (CDA), which has been at the forefront of disability rights activism locally and regionally. The primary research question: how does CDA organize strategically to meet the needs of the broader disabled population of Jamaica is broken down into the following four sub-questions: (1) how is “disability” constructed in the context of Jamaican culture, (2) how did CDA members negotiate their original involvement and level of participation with the organization, (3) what is the nature of the linkage between the CDA and Disabled People International, and how does this relationship affect CDA's policies and procedures, and (4) what strategies does CDA employ to mobilize PWDs in Jamaica to participate in advocacy activities? These questions are explored using participant observation, semi-structured interviews, survey, and document review. Findings reveal a complex construction of disability as Jamaicans negotiate between various beliefs and ideas to understand the meaning of disability.

Activists who take part in an NGO’s campaigns encounter a system of genres that aligns their human rights literacies and discourse with the NGO’s ideological and organizational structure. The genres that activists use thus play a powerful socializing role, placing the discourse of activists within a complex context of organizational discourse that not only embodies specific human rights exigencies, but also specific organizational rationales for addressing those exigencies. Human rights NGOs, while often reflecting an ideology of a common, unified voice for human rights, are in fact heterogeneous networks of discursive agents that are linked together through complex interdiscursive exchanges. I argue that these rhetorical exchanges reflect a set of mediating rhetorical strategies that NGOs employ to translate their professional advocacy into terms and genres accessible to their membership and to their public activists. This analysis is developed from a case study of the organizational structure and discursive communities of Amnesty International (AI) and the influence of Amnesty‘s advocacy structures and techniques on the NGOs and social movements that lobby for human rights. Chapters one and two analyze the problem of discursive agency in discussions of global and transnational civil society, aligning critical discussions of the development of global public opinion with critiques of the growing professionalism of human rights NGOs. In chapter three, I trace the relationship of AI’s professional genres to the international institutions of human rights policy and law. Chapter four examines the activist genre system of Amnesty International and the role of professional discourse plays in framing opportunities for the activism of Amnesty’s members. I then turn in chapter five to an analysis of the multi-modal genres and web genres that AI has utilized to construct public awareness of its campaigns. Chapter six concludes the study by tracing out the implications of this analysis for theories of the public sphere and global civil society. I argue that genre analysis provides a means for understanding the social contexts, discursive agencies, and embodied literacies of contemporary public discourse.",304828733,,Dissertations & Theses," Minnix, Christopher ToddMinnixToddChristopherMinnix, Christopher Todd",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1417815231 , 38188801 , 66569 , 9780549298878 , 3286941 , 3286941", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549298878, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304828733?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," International law , International relations , Rhetoric , Composition"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Amnesty International , Discursive activism , Genre theory , Human rights , Nongovernmental organizations , Rhetoric and composition , Transnational activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Professional+publics%2Fprivate+citizens%3A+Human+rights+NGOs+and+the+sponsoring+of+public+discursive+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Minnix%2C+Christopher+Todd&amp;isbn=9780549298878&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"103,The burden of witnessing: Media and mobilization in the age of genocide,"The 1948 UN Convention on Genocide signaled an international commitment to the protection of imperiled communities. However, the lack of operative treaty bodies assigned to monitor global compliance has undermined the effectiveness of this law rendering it little but an abstract promise, as evidenced by such cases as Bosnia, Rwanda, and the crisis in Sudan. In the place of effective international law, monitoring and response duties have fallen to media actors including journalists and human rights organizations from international NGOs to local grassroots social movements, who use cameras to document abuses and appeal to action. Embedded in these uses is the Enlightenment conviction that exposure, the making public of these situations, will engender the logical response of action. However, global inaction in response to the crises of the 1990s generated multiple interrogations into the presumed failure of visual media. Blame has been placed on the media saturation that contributes to ""compassion fatigue,"" and desensitization; or, conversely, to the commercial and entertainment aspects that transform distant suffering into pornography of pain, and thereby generate ""inappropriate"" affect. This dissertation examines these questions by conducting a media history from select cases through the 20 th century and into the 21 st where media actors have sought to fill a political vacuum by visualizing distant crimes and producing ethical and political claims in order to mobilize global publics. In doing so, I clarify how technological innovation, strategic use of formal elements, and material practices play key roles in the formation of transnational ethical communities and the channeling of sentiment into action. In the process, the study calls attention to the significant role of media and media actors in political and legal processes, and elucidates the ways in which these media formations have never been explicitly political or legal, but from their inception intertwined in the entertainment media practices that generate so much suspicion in popular and scholarly discourses.",304830044,,Dissertations & Theses," Torchin, LeshuTorchinLeshuTorchin, Leshu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1267234581 , 35766841 , 66569 , 3247396 , 3247396", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304830044?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0708 Mass media , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0708 Mass media , 0900 Motion pictures",," 0708 Mass media , 0900 Motion pictures"," Mass media , Motion pictures"," Communication and the arts , Activism , Advocacy , Film , Genocide , Human rights , Media , Mobilization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+burden+of+witnessing%3A+Media+and+mobilization+in+the+age+of+genocide&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Torchin%2C+Leshu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"104,The visibility of sexual minority movement organizations in Namibia and South Africa,"The South African state has responded favorably to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) social movement organizations’ (SMOs) efforts to protect and extend sexual and gender minority rights, whereas Namibian state leaders have verbally attacked LGBT organizing and threatened to arrest sexual and gender minorities. In these countries, LGBT persons have organized themselves into publicly visible social movement organizations (SMOs) over the last ten years. Amid such different official responses to LGBT organizing, how, when, and why do Namibian and South African LGBT social movement organizations become publicly visible or retreat from visibility? To answer this question, I turn to sociologist James M. Jasper’s (2004, 2006) concept of “strategic dilemma.” LGBT social movement organizations encountered strategic dilemmas of visibility or invisibility when they decide whether and how to become visible, modify their public profile, or forgo political opportunities. To understand the micropolitical dynamics of how LGBT social movement organizations negotiated such strategic dilemmas of visibility and invisibility, I engaged in intensive, continuous ethnographic observation of four Namibian and South African LGBT social movement organizations for approximately 800 hours and analyzed my ethnographic fieldnotes. I also analyzed more than 2,100 newspaper articles and LGBT SMO documents and conducted 56 in-depth interviews with staff, members, and leaders of LGBT SMOs. In this dissertation, I explore the varied strategic dilemmas of visibility and invisibility that Namibian and South African LGBT SMOs faced. My findings advance social movement theorizing by demonstrating the importance of studying social movements in the global South. In addition, my findings contribute to postcolonial feminist and queer theorizing by showing how marginalized sexual and gender minorities in post-apartheid Namibia and South Africa used public visibility as a strategy to argue for their democratic inclusion.",304835029,,Dissertations & Theses," Currier, Ashley McAllisterCurrierMcAllisterAshleyCurrier, Ashley McAllister",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1407497541 , 37416171 , 66569 , 9780549258520 , 3284544 , 3284544", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549258520, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304835029?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Welfare , 0733 Gender"," 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Welfare , 0733 Gender"," 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Welfare , 0733 Gender",," 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Welfare , 0733 Gender"," Womens studies , Welfare , Gender"," Social sciences , LBGT , Namibia , Sexual minority , Social movements , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+visibility+of+sexual+minority+movement+organizations+in+Namibia+and+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Currier%2C+Ashley+McAllister&amp;isbn=9780549258520&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"105,"The transnational origin, diffusion, and transformation of “organic” agriculture: A study in social movement framing and outcomes","Social movements are dynamic processes that are important to study because of their positive and negative impacts on individuals, governments, nations, and the world. They are at once socially, politically, and rhetorically complex. Scholars have studied social movements from a variety of perspectives and disciplinary approaches including historical, sociological, political, and rhetorical. Although no single theoretical approach can encompass the entirety of social movements, interdisciplinary approaches allow for broader scope and richer theoretical explanatory power. The overall goal of this study is to develop a new theoretical approach to understanding social movements and apply it to the transnational organic agriculture movement to better understand leadership framing processes and outcomes. This study bridges sociological and rhetorical theory to better understand strategic framing processes, social movement leadership, and movement outcomes. To date, no research has chronicled and theoretically explained the movements of the organic frame and organic rhetoric from India to Europe to the United States and from embedded cultural practices to contested national legislation by keying in on the rhetorical agency of primary leadership figures and organized political petitioning. This study examines the transnational diffusion of the organic frame from India to England to the United States and analyzes the transformation of the organic frame as it was imported to different sociopolitical and sociocultural contexts. It does so by focusing on three critical framing events in the history of the organic agriculture movement. First, the study examines the origins of the organic frame as it emerged in India and was imported to England in the early twentieth century by Sir Albert Howard. Next, the study analyzes the diffusion and transformation of the organic frame as J.I. Rodale framed an organic program for the United States in the mid-twentieth century. Then, the study analyzes a third critical framing event involving a frame dispute between the USDA and a coalition of organic agriculture movement organizations in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The study concludes that Howard's seminal text on organic agriculture was an exemplar of social movement leadership framing because it included the dual purpose of creating a new way of approaching agriculture and serving as a manual for action. Sir Albert Howard successfully led the transnational diffusion of organic agriculture by blending eastern and western beliefs and practices, his committed cross-cultural promoting of a holistic agriculture, and attacking processes and forces rather than individuals or institutions. J. I. Rodale met rhetorical problems strategically by transforming the organic frame in ways that functioned to help transform American attitudes toward the soil and health. The study also revealed that in the late twentieth century the U.S. organic agriculture movement was politically-savvy, able to influence the national legislative agenda as well as its content. This study demonstrates the useful linkages between sociological frame analysis and the rhetorical theory of functional social movement persuasion by discovering that the core framing tasks of diagnosis and prognosis are largely composed of praise and blame as well as transforming individuals' perceptions of reality and that motivational framing and Burke's theory of identification provide another useful conceptual hybrid between sociological and rhetorical social movement theory.",304835352,,Dissertations & Theses," Frye, Joshua J.FryeJ.JoshuaFrye, Joshua J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1445041261 , 38246311 , 66569 , 9780549359821 , 3291223 , 3291223", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549359821, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304835352?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0473 Agriculture , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0459 Communication , 0473 Agriculture , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0459 Communication , 0473 Agriculture , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory",," 0459 Communication , 0473 Agriculture , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," Communication , Agriculture , Organizational behavior , Organization theory"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agriculture , Framing , Leadership , Organic agriculture , Social movement , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+transnational+origin%2C+diffusion%2C+and+transformation+of+%E2%80%9Corganic%E2%80%9D+agriculture%3A+A+study+in+social+movement+framing+and+outcomes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Frye%2C+Joshua+J.&amp;isbn=9780549359821&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"106,Jammin' with resistant music and popular culture in Bob Marley's “Jah -Public”,"Any discussion of reggae music and its value in investigating the intersections of popular music, resistant action, mass production, and global consumption must take into account Bob Marley. He is often cited as one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 20 th century. Although his style of ""roots reggae"" emerges from a specific postcolonial Jamaican context, Marley's music appears at the site of many political and social movements throughout the world in places far from this local. In the 21 st century and over 20 years after his death, Marley's popularity continues to grow through processes of consumption and globalization. Marley and his music represent both the entertainment value of popular music and the critical capacity found in acts of resistance. When Marley's name, image and music are situated within discussions of resistance, human rights, and social justice, the following questions arise: what is the significance of his role? What exactly is Marley's contribution to resistance struggles for social justice? Chapter One identifies elements in Marley's postcolonial messages that are linked to resistant acts. There is theoretical consideration of three kinds of resistance: cultural resistance, structural resistance, and ideological resistance. Chapter Two is divided into three sections organized in such a way to reveal the multiple levels that Marley's music and lyrics are interpreted in the processes of resistance. Chapter Three draws the significance of Marley's music in social movements into contemporary discussions in public sphere theory. There is attention to how themes in Marley's music can be understood as key elements of rational-critical debate in transnational public spheres.",304837112,,Dissertations & Theses," Nordine, ManishaNordineManishaNordine, Manisha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1407496291 , 36647601 , 66569 , 9780549218562 , 3280722 , 3280722", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549218562, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304837112?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0413 Music , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0413 Music , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0413 Music , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Music , British and Irish literature"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Jah-Public , Jamaica , Marley, Bob , Music , Popular culture , Reggae , Resistance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jammin%27+with+resistant+music+and+popular+culture+in+Bob+Marley%27s+%E2%80%9CJah+-Public%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nordine%2C+Manisha&amp;isbn=9780549218562&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"107,"The interaction of frames, culture and resources in the Ukrainian women's movement: An analysis of Kyiv, Kharkiv and L'viv","This dissertation examines the emerging Ukrainian women's movement in 2002 and 2003 in three regionally distinct Ukrainian cities; Kyiv, Kharkiv, and L'viv. Using social movement theory this study focuses on the dominant frames being used by Ukrainian women activists as they voice their concerns and solutions to local Ukrainian women, foreign donors and the broader public while seeking to acquire material resources from foreign and domestic sources. This research helps to answer the following questions. To what extent is the success of women's groups and groups generally constrained by culture? Can groups that represent women outside of the dominant cultural perspective succeed in bringing about their desired social changes? To what extent do the three different local cultural contexts act as resources and constraints for social movement actors in their framing activities and attempts to bring about change? What are the influences of large amounts of international funding and severely limited domestic resources on a women's movement in a post-Soviet context? The effects of local culture and context, resources, both domestic and international, and elite allies are examined for their influence on the construction of frames used by Ukrainian women activists. In addition, the influences of frames, local cultural contexts, domestic and foreign material resources, and elite allies on social movement outcomes are examined. In-depth interviews with women's activists from representative samples of women's non-governmental organizations in Kyiv, Kharkiv and L'viv, observation of movement activities and movement produced literature are the data used in this research. The findings depict a Ukrainian women's movement using frames which both resonate with local contexts and also critique them as activists struggle to reach local Ukrainian women while simultaneously negotiating changing foreign donor priorities. Local cultures and contexts along with foreign funding influenced the construction of frames and progress toward desired outcomes. Domestic material resources had no observable impact on frame construction and often the opposite than expected relationship to outcomes. The ability of women's activists to make progress toward their desired goals within their cities was varied as each local cultural context presented different opportunities and constraints.",304837865,,Dissertations & Theses," Morford, Nicole EdgarMorfordEdgarNicoleMorford, Nicole Edgar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1464119981 , 37474551 , 66569 , 9780549430070 , 3299029 , 3299029", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549430070, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304837865?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," Womens studies , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Culture , Frames , Kharkiv , Kyiv , L'viv , Resources , Social movements , Ukraine , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+interaction+of+frames%2C+culture+and+resources+in+the+Ukrainian+women%27s+movement%3A+An+analysis+of+Kyiv%2C+Kharkiv+and+L%27viv&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morford%2C+Nicole+Edgar&amp;isbn=9780549430070&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"108,Emergent socialities: Networks of biodiversity and anti -globalization,"There are a number of distinguishing features that mark globalization as a historically significant period.

Do norms become ingrained in the practices of intergovernmental organizations to such an extent that they hinder a movement with different norms or help a movement that conforms to them? In studying the UN and especially UN global conferences on issues of social significance, it has been argued that the norms stemming from classic Lockean liberalism, such as emphasis on individual liberties, a rights-based framework for developing policy, and progress through science and reason, are embodied in the procedures and frameworks of UN global conferences. I compare the strategies and influence of the abortion-rights and anti-abortion movements over time at the UN, particularly through the International Conferences on Population and Development, and trace how each movement has adjusted its strategies to accommodate the normative context it has encountered at the UN. I use a combined structural and agency-oriented framework that identifies the concrete mechanisms and processes through which the interplay of movement ideology and institutional-normative context may constrain or facilitate a social movement's actions within the UN system. What I've found in my research is that the abortion-rights network has had more success in actually influencing the debate and changing the language of population policy to reflect their goals, whereas the influence of the anti-abortion network can really only be measured by the language that they have blocked. But it is important to note that both the abortion-rights network and the anti-abortion network have adjusted over time to the UN in terms of their strategies, which is interesting because of the more progressive character of one, and the conservative character of the other. However, the progressive and conservative characters of the two movements still affected how easily each movement adapted to these norms at the UN, and the success of their strategies in that forum.",304838121,,Dissertations & Theses," Samuel, JuneSamuelJuneSamuel, June",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1490073751 , 36774401 , 66569 , 9780549451051 , 3297256 , 3297256", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549451051, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304838121?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Abortion , Abortion rights network , Antiabortion network , Networks , Norms , Social movements , Transnational activism , United Nations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Adapting+to+norms+at+the+United+Nations%3A+The+abortion-rights+and+anti-abortion+networks&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Samuel%2C+June&amp;isbn=9780549451051&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"110,"Social protest, freedom, and play as rebellion","This dissertation explores historical notions of resistance alongside contemporary playful forms of rebellion. This analysis is centered on the relationship of play to social protest encompassing why we play, how we play, and what this can mean to academics studying social movements, as well as specific contributions for engagement as activists and artists. I propose the need to re-invest in the possibilities of social protest given the absurd nature of certain contemporary political situations and the negative exposure of “somber street protest” by the mainstream media. I rely on play research, performance studies, folktales of tricksters and clowns, sociological research on dissent, analysis of consumerism and identity, and activist publications. This examination includes the work of Erich Fromm, Albert Camus, the Situationist International, Victor Turner, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Social protest needs to be dynamic to attract participants, inviting participation and enjoyment. My dissertation develops a philosophical structure furthering how we can conceive of dissent within the current political and cultural framework in the United States and investigates actual sites of innovative social movements, including the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army, the Ministry of Reshelving, Tape Babies, Detroit Demolition, guerrilla gardening, and the Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping.",304839313,,Dissertations & Theses," McClish, Carmen L.McClishL.CarmenMcClish, Carmen L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1390296641 , 37707261 , 66569 , 9780549171652 , 3275782 , 3275782", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549171652, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304839313?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass media"," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass media"," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass media",," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass media"," Communication , Mass media"," Communication and the arts , Freedom , Play , Rebellion , Social protest",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+protest%2C+freedom%2C+and+play+as+rebellion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McClish%2C+Carmen+L.&amp;isbn=9780549171652&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"111,Building cosmopolitical solidarity from the “Antigone”: A return to the chorus,"""Building Cosmopolitical Solidarity from the Antigone,"" takes an in-depth look at how the Antigone by Sophocles has been used by social movements and social/politically concerned playwrights, theorists and activists as either a tool for discursive and performative resistance, or as a way to reinforce status-quo state rule since at least the Enlightenment to present day. I argue that Sophocles' characters Creon and Antigone are not ideal images for social movements who seek a cosmopolitical democracy. Rather it is to Sophocles' Chorus and the Watchman that we must turn when proposing democratic cosmopolitanism. Thus, a new communication approach is proposed: a choral dialogue driven by pragmatic logic and employing an aesthetic, often comedic, improvisational experience. Further, this work strives to unite theories from social science, social movement theory, rhetoric, philosophy and theatre. Its aim is to offer practical tools for social movements who wish to gain international, cosmopolitical, stature and to encourage a progressive democratic space. Core study groups include the Project for a New American Century, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping, ACT-UP, and the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army.",304839982,,Dissertations & Theses," McCarthy, Rebecca L.McCarthyL.RebeccaMcCarthy, Rebecca L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1317328211 , 36585251 , 66569 , 3256895 , 3256895", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304839982?accountid=14496," 0422 Philosophy , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0422 Philosophy , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0422 Philosophy , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0422 Philosophy , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Philosophy , Sociology , Rhetoric , Composition"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Antigone , Burke, Kenneth , Framing theory , Pragmatism , Social movements , Sophocles",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+cosmopolitical+solidarity+from+the+%E2%80%9CAntigone%E2%80%9D%3A++A+return+to+the+chorus&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCarthy%2C+Rebecca+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"112,"Transnational media imaginaries: Cinema, digital technology and uneven globalization","This dissertation analyzes different modalities of movement in the current cinematic arena. Through an analysis of the multiple media platforms through which films circulate, I conceptualize a theoretical framework to understand the variety of encounters between historical events, ideological discourses, film texts and spectators. This project attempts to mobilize a transnational paradigm in the analysis of film practices with the purpose of mapping some of the fundamental ways in which the producers and consumers of culture encounter each other. It embarks thus on a discussion of a series of physical and cultural bodies meeting in the cross-fertilizing spaces between the cinematic and the social. The dissertation specifically focuses on the movement of bodies across geopolitical and media spaces. This entails the exploration of four kinds of migration. First, it engages in a critical analysis of the role of film trailers in the digital age. It maps the manners in which media circulates in the different ""windows"" of the film market while specifically evaluating the different forms of spectatorship that Web navigation constructs. Second, it studies films that draw competing cartographies of the millennium global cityscape. It explores the manners in which filmmakers represent the constitution of the megalopolis' multicultural fabric to give an account of the contending forces at play in shaping its economic and social structures. Third, it analyzes the works of directors that have followed diverse cross-cultural migration trajectories: John Woo—from the arena of Hong Kong commercial film to Hollywood—Alejandro Amenábar—appropriating several Hollywood genres to conquer a share of the Spanish national film market and project his work internationally—and Quentin Tarantino—who has rearticulated other, non-U.S., cinematic traditions to move from American independent film into the wider arena of the mainstream. Fourth, this project examines films that deal specifically with the physical migration of bodies from economically disfavored countries into the West. In addition, it analyzes films that narrativize the mediation of corporate and mass consumption in the configuration of human subjectivity.",304840123,,Dissertations & Theses," Rodriguez Ortega, VicenteRodriguez OrtegaVicenteRodriguez Ortega, Vicente",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472131351 , 35766791 , 66569 , 9780549425984 , 3296853 , 3296853", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549425984, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304840123?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0615 Political science , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0615 Political science , 0900 Motion pictures",," 0615 Political science , 0900 Motion pictures"," Political science , Motion picture industry , Globalization , Digital electronics , Technology , Motion pictures"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Cinema , Digital technology , Global city , Globalization , Media imaginaries , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+media+imaginaries%3A+Cinema%2C+digital+technology+and+uneven+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rodriguez+Ortega%2C+Vicente&amp;isbn=9780549425984&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"113,Reconciliation contested: Understandings of reconciliation by NGOs in South Africa,"The purpose of this study was to determine how staff at NGOs involved primarily with reconciliation work in South Africa understand the term reconciliation, and how their understandings of this term inform their reconciliation work. The study addresses: How NGOs' understandings of this term differ from those of their clients, and whose definitions matter most when addressing reconciliation needs of individuals within a larger project of national healing; how the work of reconciliation NGOs contributes to the balance between remembering the past while forging ahead with development; why, despite all of the reconciliation rhetoric do certain groups and individuals continue to be marginalized so many years after institutionalized liberation; and how the work of South African reconciliation NGOs constitutes a social movement. Chapter one outlines the research design, providing an introduction to the significance of reconciliation work in South Africa. Chapter two is a multidisciplinary literature review, providing projected contributions to the fields of peace and conflict studies, communication, and international education. Chapter three, ""Making National Reconciliation Personal,"" differentiates between South Africa's national project of reconciliation and the quests for intrapersonal, interpersonal, interracial, and intercultural healing. Chapter four, ""Balancing Reconciling the Past with Moving On, "" argues that reconciliation is a balancing act (Bhargava, 2000), discussing how individuals' reconciliation needs must not be sacrificed for the sake of development and democratization. Chapter five, ""Reconciling Formerly Marginalized Identities in the Rainbow Nation, "" explores the work of reconciliation NGO staff and their programs, focusing on marginalized identity as a result of gender, class, race, HIV and AIDS, and sexual orientation. Chapter six, ""Reconciliation as a Social Movement,"" discusses the ways reconciliation NGOs, their staff, and their clients may be construed as primary agents of change in a South African reconciliation movement.

Building upon recent work in Native American history, critical geographies of capital and the nation, and critical race studies, it argues that the Black Hawk War represents a largely unacknowledged turning point in the history of early industrial capitalism, racial formation, and American imperialism. Focusing upon social relations in the upper Mississippi River valley, it argues that everyday struggles between Native peoples and white settlers—over land, over gender roles, over law and its interpretation—occurred within the context of rapidly shifting global market forces, and that the strategies adopted by those who were party to these struggles represented attempts at intervening in global political and economic processes. At times, the social tensions born of new economic imperatives erupted into violent conflicts. These conflicts became the pretense for federal intervention in the region, as local elites represented isolated incidents and disinterested Native movements as part of a coordinated military campaign, an ""Indian war"" that could only be put down with support from the federal government. Indeed, in the summer of 1832, President Andrew Jackson ordered nearly half of all federal troops to the region in an effort to head off Indian aggression. Through the militarization everyday social relations, local white elites were able to consolidate their control over the regional lead trade and to banish Native economic competitors beyond the Mississippi River. As an effect of its immediate bodily impact, military control significantly altered the ways in which people perceived their relationships to one another, giving rise to a sense of both racial distinctiveness and economic individuality. Ultimately, the ""Midwestern"" lead trade that emerged in the aftermath of the Black Hawk War allowed for the accelerated development of northeastern industry.",304841181,,Dissertations & Theses," Waterman, Adam JohnWatermanJohnAdamWaterman, Adam John",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1555621721 , 35766191 , 66569 , 9780549583035 , 3310577 , 3310577", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549583035, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304841181?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," American studies , American history , Native Americans , Native studies"," Social sciences , Black Hawk War , Colonization , Corn , Industrialism , Law , Lead , Mercantilism , Mississippi Valley",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+price+of+the+purchase%3A+Black+Hawk%27s+War+and+the+colonization+of+the+upper+Mississippi+River+valley&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Waterman%2C+Adam+John&amp;isbn=9780549583035&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"115,The hidden wounds of Vieques: A political ecology of disease and collective actions in a militarized landscape,"Infant mortality rates have decreased in all industrialized countries, including Puerto Rico. Yet in Vieques' municipality this rate has increased by 12 percent. This and other dramatic changes in public health have taken place within the last 20 years. Recently, the inhabitants of Vieques have massively organized around issues of health, mobilizing collective actions unheard of in Puerto Rico. This social movement, which has captured international attention, has cut across religious and political lines never before traversed within Puerto Rican history. What are the factors triggering this social movement? How do the people of Vieques experience and make sense of these changes in public health? How have these changes affected people's perceptions of health, illness and self? I suspect that by exploring the interplay between (1) changing perceptions of health risks and (2) shifting notions of self as (3) experienced by being and dwelling-in-a-world of environment crises, we can get insights into these questions. By situating at the center of the analysis the relationship between illness and identity we can gain insights into the emergence of environmental movements as processes of identity formation. This project explores how shared experience of illness can generate new questions, knowledge and understandings within communities experiencing critical health problems. I sustain that peoples embodied understandings of the relationships between environment and disease trigger—within militarized or industrialized landscapes—powerful cultural critiques that offer insights into both modernitys failures and the emergence of social movements.",304843554,,Dissertations & Theses," Torres-Velez, Victor M.Torres-VelezM.VictorTorres-Velez, Victor M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1417804551 , 37161001 , 66569 , 9780549241614 , 3282206 , 3282206", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549241614, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304843554?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology"," Cultural anthropology , Forensic anthropology"," Social sciences , Collective actions , Environmental justice , Militarized , Political ecology , Puerto Rico , Social movements , Vieques",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+hidden+wounds+of+Vieques%3A++A+political+ecology+of+disease+and+collective+actions+in+a+militarized+landscape&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Torres-Velez%2C+Victor+M.&amp;isbn=9780549241614&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"116,"Protests without tear gas: Portrayals of campus activism in the print media, 1996–2004","This study examines how student activists were portrayed by the campus daily newspaper during the time period 1996-2004. Duke University in Durham, North Carolina is the subject of this qualitative case study, which uses the dramaturgical theory of sociologist Erving Goffman as its framework. The issues taken on by student activists at Duke during this time period include the anti-sweatshop movement, race relations on campus, identity issues of African Americans, Asian Americans, women and political conservatives, and the Sudanese civil war. The Chronicle, Duke’s daily campus newspaper, portrays the student activists in a number of roles that are categorized as campus/education roles, political roles, and social roles. The campus/education roles have been identified as educator, campus leader, object of ridicule and satire (as viewed by their fellow students), partner in university governance, and change agent or catalyst. The political roles are concerned citizen (both on campus and in the larger community), policy maker (for campus policy as well as local/national/international policy), representative/diplomat/spokesperson, idealist (someone who acts beyond or above politics), political agent, person with power and consumer advocate. The social roles identified by the study are moral conscience or compass, moral bully, social critic, champion of the underdog, social support network, and symbol maker.

This study analyzes how social movements in low-income communities engage in framing—the articulation of grievances—in response to gentrification. In examining mobilization efforts in the Mission District and West Oakland, two neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area, I found that while the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition (MAC) employed a frame of communitarian global class struggle, the West Oakland movement articulated a rights-based discourse of classical liberal values. These frames also reflect these communities' social histories. In showing how these frames pervaded the practices, policies, and tactics of each of these movements, I illustrate how each frame carries both liabilities and advantages that the other lacks. While the communitarian frame was more effective in mobilizing MAC's base constituents, it was exclusionary and alienated outsiders, particularly the media and political elites. The liberalist frame was more inclusive, but emphasized market approaches such as homeownership that discouraged grassroots political organizing for systemic structural change. These outcomes emerged in the qualitative analysis of field notes, newspaper articles, and interviews, as well as the quantitative analysis of newspaper coverage of these movements. While the MAC movement was able to mobilize hundreds of neighborhood residents and supporters to testify against development projects, the West Oakland movement was not able to mobilize residents to participate in redevelopment. The MAC movement generated more media publicity; however, its media coverage was more polarized, and the West Oakland movement was better able to get core objectives of affordable housing and equitable development into media coverage because it was less controversial. Poor people's movements face a paradox. Frames that amplify the grievances of the discontented masses are more likely to alienate movement outsiders and cost the movement the support of elites and the general public. Frames that resonate better with mainstream values are more likely to secure elite support and win public opinion, but may not be sufficiently challenging to stimulate grassroots protest against material conditions.",304846024,,Dissertations & Theses," Gin, June LeeGinLeeJuneGin, June Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1404354271 , 37953001 , 66569 , 9780549173991 , 3276165 , 3276165", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549173991, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304846024?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Environmental science , Urban planning , Area planning & development"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , California , Community , Framing , Gentrification , Political history , San Francisco Bay Area",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CWe%27re+here+and+we%27re+not+leaving%E2%80%9D%3A++Framing%2C+political+history%2C+and+community+response+to+gentrification+in+the+San+Francisco+Bay+Area&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gin%2C+June+Lee&amp;isbn=9780549173991&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"118,Art and revolution in West Germany: The cultural origins of 1968,"This dissertation situates the mythic year of 1968 in the framework of the long 1960s, the period from 1957 to 1970. I investigate the folk heroes as well as the lesser-known protagonists of the radical extra-parliamentary left in West Germany and show how these groups fit within an intergenerational and international context that gradually built a movement around demands for social reform and anti-imperialist and anti-Cold War policies. By working within the framework of the long sixties, I challenge two standard models used to explain the political unrest of the late-1960s. First, I reconsider the common depiction of the 1960s as a cultural and political departure from the conformist 1950s. Until recently, scholars have typically attributed the rise of the student movement to generational conflicts. I argue that although generational differences were integral to the way the New Left framed its political goals, the origins of 1968 must be placed within a broader intergenerational and transnational project. Indeed, the radical avant-garde groups of the late-1950s and early-1960s salvaged turn-of-the-century and interwar political utopias and adapted them to their postwar, post-Fordist consumer society. In addition, my use of unconventional sources allows me to complicate the narrative of continuity versus rupture. For example, I turn to women's memoirs as well as personal interviews to examine the uneven application of revolutionary ideas in everyday life. These sources allow me to contrast teleological narratives of the 1950s and 1960s that reductively end in the student protests of 1968 with a more complex story of how these groups remained embedded in the cultural assumptions, especially sexist positions, of their time. Finally, this dissertation follows the trajectory of utopia as a concept and goal. After the Second World War, the notion of utopia seemed completely discredited until the late-1950s when the groups under examination revived the concept in new social and cultural frameworks. In my research, I follow the subsequent rise and fall of these utopian projects.",304849146,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Mia ChingLeeChingMiaLee, Mia Ching",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1404341341 , 37950581 , 66569 , 9780549175414 , 3276225 , 3276225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549175414, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304849146?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History",," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," European history , History"," Social sciences , Art , Avant-garde , Germany , Revolution , Student movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Art+and+revolution+in+West+Germany%3A+The+cultural+origins+of+1968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Mia+Ching&amp;isbn=9780549175414&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"119,Imagining “el pueblo”: Pan-Latin American subaltern solidarity and the music of &lt;i&gt;nueva canción&lt;/i&gt;,"This thesis is an examination of the origin and diffusion of the Pan-Latin American song movement nueva canción . It argues that the nueva canción movement represents a cultural process, through which members of the middle and lower classes in Latin America, in order to more effectively challenge the hegemonic presence of a globally interconnected elite, have ""imagined"" themselves to be part of a singular transnational subaltern community, signified in music through folkloric and historical references, and commonly referred to as ""el pueblo"" (the people). This discussion includes an analysis of the concatenated sense of aesthetics through which nueva canción artists have attempted to simultaneously reflect their ""subaltern"" social and political solidarity at both the national and international levels. It also argues that the lyrical themes included in many nueva canción compositions often function as a traditionalizing process through which the artists and aficionados connected to the genre symbolize their social condition and identity in the present by associating themselves with events and personalities in the past. Throughout this thesis the Chilean manifestation of the nueva canción movement is highlighted as it represents an adequate local reflection of the entire transnational community.",304849679,,Dissertations & Theses," Bodiford, James RyanBodifordRyanJamesBodiford, James Ryan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1459904001 , 37161001 , 66569 , 9780549418856 , 1451548 , 1451548", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549418856, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304849679?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+%E2%80%9Cel+pueblo%E2%80%9D%3A+Pan-Latin+American+subaltern+solidarity+and+the+music+of+nueva+canci%C3%B3n&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bodiford%2C+James+Ryan&amp;isbn=9780549418856&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"120,Bastards of utopia: An ethnography of radical politics after Yugoslav socialism,"Once-socialist Europe has played a significant role in the global ascendancy of neoliberalism, both in dismantling capitalism's primary rival and embracing a market economy. In the former Yugoslavia, official Marxism was dismantled with a particular fury. In this dissertation I examine the emergent neoliberal order—and social movement resistance to it—in the Republic of Croatia since the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. In contrast to the nationalism that dominated the region, the anticapitalist movements I studied, illegitimate offspring of the contemporary and socialist systems, practiced a politics that was both transnational and antinationalist. In this dissertation I draw on forty months of fieldwork completed between 1996 and 2006. While based primarily in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, I also traveled with activists to conferences, trainings, and protests throughout Europe. The majority of activists with whom I collaborated described themselves as anarchists and identified with militant mobilizations against neoliberalism in Chiapas, Seattle, Prague, and Genoa. Anarchists proved to be particularly compelling collocutors in thinking ethnographically about neoliberalism because anarchists, like anthropologists, understand the political not as a separate sphere, but as permeating every aspect of social life. In this spirit, I am attentive to activists' daily efforts at squatting, scavenging, self-education, and the organization of an ""autonomous"" social and cultural existence. Activists also participated in what they called the ""movement of movements,"" which consisted of transnational networks of collaborative production that included new media and communications, circuits of travel and reciprocal hospitality, subcultural goods, the exchange of modular tactics, and collectively organized confrontations with the state. Activist efforts to put their politics into action in the specific conditions of contemporary Croatia provide this dissertation's zone of critical analysis, the product of interaction between activist practices and the field of opportunity and restraint they encountered in urban Zagreb. A richly textured account of the social and economic order in Croatia emerges—what might be called really existing neoliberalism—marked by a three-fold transition of marketization, democratization, and nation-state formation.",304849942,,Dissertations & Theses," Razsa, Maple JohnRazsaJohnMapleRazsa, Maple John",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1342728631 , 36224411 , 66569 , 9780549036852 , 3265065 , 3265065", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549036852, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304849942?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Anarchism , Neoliberalism , Radical politics , Socialism , Yugoslav",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bastards+of+utopia%3A++An+ethnography+of+radical+politics+after+Yugoslav+socialism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Razsa%2C+Maple+John&amp;isbn=9780549036852&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"121,Bolivia in the age of reckoning: The peasant-indigenous struggle for sustainable rural communities,"The 2002 presidential elections marked a turning point in Bolivia's history. In a country with a large subsistent rural population, a social movement of peasant and indigenous peoples came within a mere one and a half percentage points of wresting control of the political power that had eluded them for over five hundred years. Three years later, Evo Morales was elected president, becoming the first indigenous leader of a rural social movement to govern in Latin America. From the political ecology perspective known as liberation ecology, this thesis examines how a social movement based largely in marginalized rural communities achieved a political victory unprecedented in the Americas. The research reveals that the development of a political ""instrument"", known by its acronym MAS, originated in the peasant organizations and reflects a fusion of threats and opportunities related to the ""agrarian question"", livelihood options and ethnic identity, all of these deepened by a neoliberal economic model that exacerbated the crisis of rural communities. Leaders of the MAS successfully mobilized peasant and indigenous organizations by reaching back to elements of their 'long' history—a history in which resilience, reciprocity, and resistance to a worldview not of their making figure prominently. Events in Bolivia provide evidence of the potential to launch a democratic, counter-hegemonic offensive to an unsustainable global system that disproportionately assigns human and environmental costs and benefits, between and within nations. A Sustainable Rural Communities (SRC) framework, because of its explicit incorporation of the social instrumentality implied by ""community"", and the possibility of constructing a counter-hegemonic meaning for ""rural sustainability"", provides an ideal conceptual lens through which to explore the potential for a shift toward alternative sustainable development. By building on Sumner's (2005) theoretical model of sustainability and introducing the dimension of political agency, this research provides a means for linking the theory and praxis of social movements with alternative perspectives on sustainability. In doing so, it represents a step toward further developing the theoretical foundation of liberation ecology, and political ecology more generally.",304851478,,Dissertations & Theses," Healey, Susan E.HealeyE.SusanHealey, Susan E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1320969661 , 36649941 , 66569 , 9780494245675 , NR24567 , NR24567", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494245675, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304851478?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Bolivia , Indigenous , Liberation ecology , Peasant-indigenous , Rural communities , Sustainable communities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bolivia+in+the+age+of+reckoning%3A+The+peasant-indigenous+struggle+for+sustainable+rural+communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Healey%2C+Susan+E.&amp;isbn=9780494245675&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"122,Transnational mobilization to empower local activism: A comparison of the Korean human rights and environmental movements,"To highlight the significant role of the transnational impact on local activism neglected by previous research on the Korean social movements, I use the broad concept of transnational mobilization, which includes three kinds of transnational activism strategies: transnational advocacy networks, transnational coalitions, and transnational social movements. To map out such a dynamic development in the Korean social movements in the 1990s, I develop a model, 'empowering process model' by focusing on the convergence between social movement and international relation theories. This model includes two exogenous variables: historical contexts and triggering events which exogenously exist and then facilitate or constrain the transnational mobilization process. It also highlights the core process which includes a trilateral mechanism that connects framing, networks, and political opportunity structure (POS). This model I develop here aims to maintain a balance between the top-down and bottom-up processes on transnational activism. Based on this model, this dissertation analyzes the movement activities and conditions underlying the transnational mobilization of' Korean social movement groups from 1970s and 1990s. I intend to examine the three main questions including the reason of rapid emergence of transnational mobilization strategy; the five-coupled mechanisms of empowering process model; different patterns between the two movement sectors: human rights and environment. Given the analyses, I find out that three major factors such as democratization, globalization, and complex trilateral relationships have been playing a crucial role in empowering local activism and that the two movement sectors show contrasting patterns in implementing international norms and ideas because of complying with counter actors such as government agencies and business groups. Clearly, despite similar external conditions, different degree of trilateral reinforcement among framing, networks and POS at multi-levels makes human rights sector have more difficulty in implementing international norms and ideas than environment sector throughout the long-term process of transnational mobilization.",304851635,,Dissertations & Theses," Kong, Suk KiKongKiSukKong, Suk Ki",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1288668451 , 36106901 , 66569 , 3251288 , 3251288", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304851635?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," International law , International relations , Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Environmental movements , Human rights , Korean , Local activism , Networks , Transnational mobilization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+mobilization+to+empower+local+activism%3A++A+comparison+of+the+Korean+human+rights+and+environmental+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kong%2C+Suk+Ki&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"123,"Renegotiating peasant ecology: Responses to relocation from Celaque National Park, Honduras","National parks are not islands, but are tied to their surroundings ecologically, politically, socially, economically, and culturally. Acknowledging these relationships, this dissertation researches the impacts Celaque National Park in western Honduras has had on the Lenca populations relocated from within the boundary of the park. By situating the results within a peasant ecology theoretical framework, it is argued that the global model of exclusionary nature conservation has had social and ecological ramifications inimical to both the conservation of nature and the welfare of local populations. In the face of growing pressures on the natural systems of the earth, the conservation of natural landscapes is indeed essential; yet the realized impacts on local human populations are often treated as collateral concerns. The regulations imposed on local populations can have negative impacts including limited access to natural resources and even physical relocation of local communities. Further, the creation of protected areas can serve as a magnet for increased development activities that threaten conservation goals. Celaque National Park, Honduras serves as a representative case as park regulations and policies have led to resident relocations, altered livelihood and land-use strategies, and resultant expansion of commercial agricultural activities encroaching within the park itself. As the global conservation movement and its practice of exclusionary nature v protection becomes increasingly connected to the global political economy, it serves as a powerful vehicle for a new round of primitive accumulation. The result is the creation of land scarcity, semi-proletarianization of the peasantry, and the expansion of capitalist social relations of production in marginal peripheries of the world. Further, the practice of exclusionary protected areas disrupts the ecological relations of production of the peasantry, creating ecopolitical conflicts antithetical to the proffered goals of protected areas. Utilizing a peasant ecology framework, the broad objective of this study is to determine the alteration in the social and ecological relations of production for affected indigenous Lenca peasant communities relocated from Celaque National Park, Honduras.",304852126,,Dissertations & Theses," Timms, Benjamin F.TimmsF.BenjaminTimms, Benjamin F.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1383470131 , 36023201 , 66569 , 9780549151012 , 3274242 , 3274242", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549151012, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304852126?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography"," Cultural anthropology , Geography"," Social sciences , Celaque National Park , Coffee , Honduras , Peasant ecology , Political ecology , Relocation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Renegotiating+peasant+ecology%3A+Responses+to+relocation+from+Celaque+National+Park%2C+Honduras&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Timms%2C+Benjamin+F.&amp;isbn=9780549151012&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"124,Political dispatches with personal twists: How Iranian blogs discuss social movements,"This project examines the ways in which blogs discuss social movements and especially focuses on how the absence of journalistic norms and pressure from editors, subscribers, and advertisers increases the autonomy bloggers have to produce and publish content.

The absence of influences that dictate the ways in which traditional journalists create content allows bloggers to place social and political issues within personalized contexts, thus allowing readers to relate to them on personal levels.

Within the framework of the independent theatre movement, young dramatists are creating a new avant-garde which expands upon canonical genres by incorporating visual media, freely adapting translations, and borrowing techniques from the international experimental theatre festival held annually in Cairo since 1988. Their eclectic genres for refracting everyday discourse through performance have produced narratives, characters and speech genres that resonate with young audiences and have even won the approval of older critics and administrators seeking a revival in avant-garde theatre. However, the new generation of avant-garde dramatists is unwilling to assimilate into state theatre. Located at the margins of state institutions and of new transnational media that stage trans-Arab identity, the independent dramatists carve a space for avant-garde culture critical of both state cultural ideologies and the notion of seamless integration into a global society. The research is based on fieldwork in Cairo among dramatists who espoused the socialist-era notion of theatre as a means of cultural modernization in Egypt, acted as amateurs in university troupes or the state cultural centres called Cultural Palaces, and then decided to work independently. I examined their individual reasons for making time for theatre alongside jobs and families, and the collective aims for their avant-garde movement articulated in manifestoes, festivals and a new co-operative. Next I turn to focuses analyses of five successful plays by leading troupes. Through attendance at rehearsals and performances, studies of scripts and videotapes, I examined how troupes mobilized discourse in performance to cast new light on social roles inscribed in authoritative discourses. By counterposing the reconfiguration of place and role in these performances with more conventional dramatic genres at Cairo's state and commercial theatres, I ask how they stage the difference of identity formation for a new generation.",304858612,,Dissertations & Theses," Pahwa, SonaliPahwaSonaliPahwa, Sonali",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1417803091 , 38185021 , 66569 , 9780549268314 , 3285144 , 3285144", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549268314, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304858612?accountid=14496," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0465 Theater"," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0465 Theater"," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0465 Theater",," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0465 Theater"," Middle Eastern literature , Cultural anthropology , Theater"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Anthropology , Arab countries , Egypt , Performance studies , Sociolinguistics , Staging , Theater",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Staging+difference%3A++An+ethnography+of+new-generation+Egyptian+theatre&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pahwa%2C+Sonali&amp;isbn=9780549268314&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"126,"Communities of discourse and networks of action: Protestantism and the making of democratic movement leaders in modern Japan, 1868–1930","My dissertation examines why and how: (1) Protestantism - an alien religion - was able to take root in the hostile environment of post-feudal Japan; (2) Protestants became involved in democratic reforms, activism and movements; and (3) disproportionately became activist leaders. It shows that the making of religio-cultural policies involved more than elite manipulation. Contingencies of geopolitical competition and state formation also came into play: state elites had to balance international affairs with domestic social control agendas. Protestant development was, in large part, an unintended consequence of state politics. The essentialized understanding of Protestantism often claims that it is innately radical and supports democratic activism. However, I compare three early Protestant bands that produced most leaders, showing that member actions varied from contentiousness to conformity. The different, but mostly conformist tendencies helped Protestantism avoid targeting for state repression, abetting its survival. Protestantism's role in recruitment and mobilization was more complex than cultural determinists suggest. Although discourses of the bands diverged, they shared a broad Christian faith/identity and a similar form of nationalism. This shared culture aided the formation of a multi-organizational field across band lines. I use two movement cases (freedom of religion and anti-public prostitution movements) to show that some Protestants participated not only because of ideals but also because they could access networks emerging in the Protestant field to support specific democratic causes. Finally, I show that: (1) the ex-samurai status of most early Protestant leaders; and (2) bridge mechanisms linking young elites in the state's elite educational system to Protestant leaders and activists, contributed to the influential roles of Protestants in democratic activism. My study affirms synthetic trends in the social movement literature treating both structure and culture as causal mechanisms. It contributes to this literature by explaining: (1) how informal and emergent networks based on religion aided mobilization; (2) how non-instrumental aspects of religion facilitated movement emergence; and (3) how overlapping of the movement, Protestant and state higher education fields abetted leader production.",304863727,,Dissertations & Theses," Indergaard, Fumiko FukaseIndergaardFukaseFumikoIndergaard, Fumiko Fukase",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1686560131 , 42666611 , 66569 , 9781109041903 , 3348416 , 3348416", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9781109041903, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304863727?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure",," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," Religious history , History , Modern history , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Action networks , Democracy , Democratic movement , Historical-comparative , Japan , Leaders , Protestantism , Social mov ements , Sociology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communities+of+discourse+and+networks+of+action%3A+Protestantism+and+the+making+of+democratic+movement+leaders+in+modern+Japan%2C+1868%E2%80%931930&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Indergaard%2C+Fumiko+Fukase&amp;isbn=9781109041903&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"127,"“Kobushi ageroo! (=Pump ya fist!)”: Blackness, “race” and politics in Japanese Hiphop","This project examines how specific communities of Japanese Hiphop cultural workers translate their political identities within a black diasporic imaginary. Performances of “blackness” through the use of African American English, Hiphop language ideology, and other related operationalizations of Hiphop aesthetics are examined in a manner that considers the intersectionality of racialized, gendered and sexualized identifications. This research analyzes narratives and representations in transnational Hiphop culture in an effort to document and elucidate social realities as described by cultural workers in a transnational Japanese Hiphop community. Using Hiphop cultural production and its purported social movement as a point of entry as well as a site of inquiry, the analysis presented contributes to understandings of how “race,” gender, sexuality, class, and transnational location affect cultural workers in their everyday lived experiences and resistance strategies, such as efforts to build a social movement. This research is also necessarily about rethinking how engagements in aesthetic practices and language ideology that cannot be fully “excavated” as originating from the community in question are ethnographically interpreted as inauthentic or as mimicry. In an effort to call attention to this analytic crisis in ethnography, the objective of this project is to understand the discursive qualities of “race”—as an organizing principle of social order—when its status cannot be reduced to “origins” histories or biological classifications. The analysis addresses central questions such as how are current popular cultural productions in conversation with transnational social movement mobilizing and organization, and how are these popular cultural productions contesting historical governmental policy and identification practice? Are identifications such as “race” central to modern movement building strategies that resist governmental practice which limits and fixes identity?

The dissertation answers this question by unpacking the ""black box"" of the liberal democratic state and testing three alternative hypotheses. The chief reason why some states violate law beyond the nationstate more than others is a function of the degree to which a country's legal tradition codifies social and economic reality. As more of social and economic reality is codified into national law, the more likely a state will commit an infraction of European Union law. This argument is tested through the rigorous application of both qualitative and quantitative methods against two chief alternative explanations. Using a dataset of over 1,200 violations of the Treaty of the European Communities and its associated regulations, the statistical analysis shows that levels of codification, measured by a country's regulatory quality, is the primary explanatory factor for both why some EU member states violate the Treaty more than others and why the ECJ is more likely to settle these legal disputes when they occur. Furthermore, even though the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany have very different legal traditions and parliamentary systems, comparing the process of compliance in each of these countries in the area of the free movement of goods shows that the degree to which basic principles of law are codified determines why they have similar proportions of infringements settled by the European Court of Justice. These findings have important implications for how we understand compliance with international law and the role domestic institutions play in the compliance process, both for the member states of the European Union and for all other states in the international system. While compliance with international law can be a normatively beneficial activity at times, it can also lead to a diminishing role for national parliaments in governing society. Most importantly, the rich diversity that democratic governance produces as it codifies social reality can be lost as international institutions homogenize national legal systems in hopes of achieving other policy goals.",304865960,,Dissertations & Theses," Siegel, Scott NicholasSiegelNicholasScottSiegel, Scott Nicholas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1320969431 , 35789771 , 66569 , 3255499 , 3255499", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304865960?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Codification , Compliance , European Union , International law , Law",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Law+and+order+in+the+European+Union%3A+The+comparative+politics+of+compliance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Siegel%2C+Scott+Nicholas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"129,"Down with the embargo: Social movements, contentious politics and United States Cuba policy, (1960–2006)","Ever since the imposition of a partial embargo on Cuba by the Eisenhower administration in 1960, more than one hundred organizations in the United States have been challenging the state on U.S. Cuba policy. Collectively, these organizations constitute a dynamic social movement which represents the crucible of a new contentious ferment triggered by an intriguing blend of international, national and sub-national impulses, ironically sparking intensified relations between the two nations, particularly in the post-Cold War era. Over time, the movement has invariably re-energized, reinvented, redefined and reconstituted itself to persistently reject and attempt to reform this state policy which restricts tourist, family, cultural and academic travel, limits remittances and prohibits free trade with Cuba. This dissertation presents the first comprehensive analysis of the anti-embargo movement. It seeks to address the central research puzzle of why the movement has persisted in attempting to change U.S. Cuba policy when it has met with such limited success over time. Undertaking the analysis from the levels of both a single social movement and multiple interest groups, it describes and analyzes the network of organizations which constitute the movement. First, it recounts the story of the organizations from birth to the present: their history, goals, organizational structure, resources, size, leadership, strategies, tactics and activism. Second, it employs a social movements theoretical framework to explain the impulses prompting individuals to join the movement and the impetus accounting for its sustained activism over the last three decades. Drawing on the popular resource mobilization literature, it contends that the rational, utilitarian model is inadequate to understand the multifarious attributes of the movement. Hence, it turns to alternative views on tactical frames, solidarity networks, co-option, social capital, commitment theory, moral incentives and psychological benefits for possible answers. However, the resource mobilization perspective fails to capture the political impetus and the new contentious ferment sparked by the end of the Cold War in 1989. This necessitates encapsulating the discourse within the theoretical framework of political opportunity structures prompting an analysis of the systemic, national and sub-national impulses propelling increased collective action in the post-Cold War era.",304869156,,Dissertations & Theses," Rampersad, IndiraRampersadIndiraRampersad, Indira",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1400967271 , 37476501 , 66569 , 9780549237402 , 3281589 , 3281589", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549237402, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304869156?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Contentious politics , Cuba , Embargo , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Down+with+the+embargo%3A+Social+movements%2C+contentious+politics%0Aand+United+States+Cuba+policy%2C+%281960%E2%80%932006%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rampersad%2C+Indira&amp;isbn=9780549237402&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"130,The freedom of difference: Decolonization in Chiapas and the Niger River Delta,"This dissertation studies how globalization creates the context for violence and resistance in diverse locales around the world. The focus here is on how freedom struggles in the Niger River Delta and Chiapas, in the southern regions of Nigeria and Mexico, respectively, emerge from the historical structures of racialized control and exploitation in each area that together suture the global space. It develops a two-fold argument. First, that by looking at the historical context and present contours of the freedom struggles in Chiapas and the Niger Delta, we can understand that the process popularly (and loosely) termed ""globalization"" is driven by a concerted assault on social reproduction in both locations. The historical structure—material and symbolic—of the current globalizing moment imposes a condition of social death on these two sites. Secondly, I claim that the patina of universal suffering under the global economy crumbles once we closely interrogate how the specific histories of racial development impact globalization in different regions. The diverse histories of racial subjection lead to distinct experiences with the violence of globalization. I analyze four dimensions of the relationship: the historical development of imperialism in both locations; the effects of developmentalism in the post-war period; how neo-liberal structural adjustment policies in the current period affect social reproduction and effect control over gender and sexuality; and how the global energy industry (particularly oil) is produced through and impacts each of these forces. I will pay attention throughout to how various groups in Chiapas (primarily the Zapatista Army for National Liberation) and the Niger Delta (such as the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, among others) organize their communities to confront state power and the criminalization of their lives. Employing what I call an archive-based relational case study analysis, this comparative study of how globalization operates through different forms of racial subjection in different locations may reveal consequential limits to global solidarity, and thus perhaps some of the intrinsic barriers to profound social change.",304874568,,Dissertations & Theses," Woods, Tryon PippittWoodsPippittTryonWoods, Tryon Pippitt",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1390310541 , 37417861 , 66569 , 9780549149057 , 3274356 , 3274356", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549149057, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304874568?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Sociology , Minority & ethnic groups"," Social sciences , Chiapas , Decolonization , Freedom , Mexico , Niger River Delta , Nigeria , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+freedom+of+difference%3A++Decolonization+in+Chiapas+and+the+Niger+River+Delta&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Woods%2C+Tryon+Pippitt&amp;isbn=9780549149057&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"131,"Youth groups and youth savers: Gangs, crews, and the rise of Filipino American youth culture in Los Angeles","Extensive field ethnography of youth groups in Los Angeles (as well as previous work in the Philippines) has shown me that the ""gang"" framework and the ""gang/non-gang"" dichotomy, widely held by both law enforcement and influential researchers cannot adequately explain the rise and creation of a violence-rejecting, fun-seeking Filipino American youth culture in Los Angeles. Rather than search for defects in the mental and social backgrounds of immigrant youths and explain gangs as a response to difficult acculturation, I bring attention to pre-immigration American cultural influences (Hollywood and the college fraternity system) that provide models for aggressive masculinity and group bonding. An examination of youth formations like the transplanted ""barkada,"" gang, Filipino American fraternity, the more recent ""crew"" and the linkages among them illustrates the relative complexity of the phenomenon and challenges dominant images and representations of Filipino American gangs and youth. This socio-historical, transnational approach enables me to examine the phenomenon across multiple geographic locations, rather than the single location analysis that results from a more traditional acculturation framework. It considerably expands the historical context, reveals a circular, trans-Pacific movement rather than one-way linearity and draws attention to the strength and persistence of the ""barkada,"" the third most important social unit in Philippine society. This study rests on data generated from ethnographic field research, individual and group interviews, and content analysis of news reports, articles from both conventional library as well as internet sources, and other Filipiniana materials. Field research was not confined to the social spaces of youth groups; of great significance is data gathered from my work at SIPA, the social service agency and my observations of interactions between counselors and youth clients. The activities of youth saving social workers, community activists, students, media, as well as law enforcement agents draw attention to the controlling and normalizing functions of the therapeutic state and the perpetuation of dominant images of ""gang.""",304875735,,Dissertations & Theses," Alsaybar, Bangele DeguzmanAlsaybarDeguzmanBangeleAlsaybar, Bangele Deguzman",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1481660211 , 37597041 , 66569 , 9780549485322 , 3302589 , 3302589", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549485322, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304875735?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American studies , Cultural anthropology , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Asian hip-hop , California , Crews , Filipino-American , Filipino-American history , Filipino-American youth , Gangs , Los Angeles , Transnationality of youth , Youth culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Youth+groups+and+youth+savers%3A++Gangs%2C+crews%2C+and+the+rise+of+Filipino+American+youth+culture+in+Los+Angeles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alsaybar%2C+Bangele+Deguzman&amp;isbn=9780549485322&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"132,&lt;i&gt;La Marianne Noire&lt;/i&gt;: How gender and race in the twentieth century Atlantic world reshaped the debate about human rights,"The story begins at the close of WWI when world leaders met at the Paris Peace Conference to reconfigure how nations interacted. The rhetoric produced during this period of self-determination encouraged groups around the globe to seize this unique moment in history and organize for a more just and humane world. However, the ideal of universal rights proved difficult to legislate as nations categorized racial and gendered inequality as matters to be dealt with locally rather than in the global arena. Repeatedly, groups that sought international solutions to ameliorate the condition of oppressed people were turned away. The Nardal sisters of Martinique were among the first black women to be educated in the French colonial system. Arriving in the métropole of Paris just after the Paris Peace Conference, these sisters were central in shaping a new international black consciousness through their literary salons, publications, and social networks. Moreover, they helped to usher in a new phase of French intellectualism that was inclusive, forging networks among women and men, Africans and Americans, Jews and Catholics. Strong Catholics and French assimilationists themselves, the Nardal sisters illustrate the tensions that arose when ideological factors such as the growth of the Communist Party, the rise of fascism, and movements for decolonization threatened to destabilize the transnational common ground forged in the 1920s. The trauma of World War II, German occupation of France, and the resulting scattering of the Park-based intelligentsia replanted the cosmopolitan consciousness developed in interwar Paris into the local communities of these colonial elites. In particular, the struggles for racial meeting and networking with each other—an experience that shifted how they viewed and related to the world around them. Ultimately, I argue that the intellectual processes that shaped a generation of transnational intellectuals between the two world wars created new social and political movements that served as countercurrents to the dominant powers of the twentieth century.",304875961,,Dissertations & Theses," McTighe Musil, Emily KirklandMcTighe MusilKirklandEmilyMcTighe Musil, Emily Kirkland",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1495959421 , 39472421 , 66569 , 9780549511847 , 3304790 , 3304790", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549511847, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304875961?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0582 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0733 Gender"," 0328 Black history , 0582 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0733 Gender"," 0328 Black history , 0582 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0733 Gender",," 0328 Black history , 0582 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0733 Gender"," Black history , History , International law , International relations , Gender"," Social sciences , Atlantic world , Gender , Human rights , Race , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=La+Marianne+Noire%3A+How+gender+and+race+in+the+twentieth+century+Atlantic+world+reshaped+the+debate+about+human+rights&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McTighe+Musil%2C+Emily+Kirkland&amp;isbn=9780549511847&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"133,The space for race: The minority demographics of United States modernism,"The Space for Race reconsiders American modernist culture by focusing on the complex relationship between racial identity and spatial experience at the start of the twentieth century. Supplementing formalist approaches to modernism, this dissertation envisions American modernist literature and culture in relation to broader conceptual problems that arise with interracial contact and the global movement of peoples to the United States. To view U.S. modernism in multi-racial, transcultural contexts is to understand that minority subjects have never taken for granted the task of orienting themselves within a social landscape often hostile to their presence. Along with the project of recontextualizing American modernism, the dissertation intervenes in the field of postmodern spatial theory by putting it in dialogue with theories of racial identity. Fredric Jameson's concept of cognitive mapping provides the starting point for my theoretical argument: I claim that the chaotic experience of urban life during the late-nineteenth/early-twentieth century illuminates how cognitive mapping might be reconceived. The introductory chapter frames the historical background and the theoretical project of the dissertation, examining modernism as a cultural practice that imagines relationships between agents in social space. The chapters of my dissertation compare narrative accounts of ethnic European assimilation, Chinese transnationalism, and an African American global imagination. Chapter one interrogates the biopolitics of Jacob Riis's How the Other Half Lives , exploring how racial difference is coded and materialized in the urban geographies he imagines and depicts. Chapter two offers a new perspective on critical debates over the identity politics of Sui Sin Far's writing by shifting the discussion to transnationalism. Within this historical context, Sui's figuration of Chinese merchants translates transnational power dynamics into U.S. racial hierarchies. Chapter three traces the transition W.E.B. Du Bois makes from a national perspective on race to a global one in Darkwater , marking his move from romantic racialism to a social constructionist view. Chapter four examines the relationship between race and space in Nella Larsen's Quicksand by casting the novel's protagonist Helga Crane as a flâneuse, which foregrounds how race, gender, sexuality, and class shape the urban experience of African American women.",304878532,,Dissertations & Theses," Pan, Arnold Ling-ChuangPanLing-ChuangArnoldPan, Arnold Ling-Chuang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251899051 , 35509731 , 66569 , 9780542991646 , 3243272 , 3243272", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780542991646, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304878532?accountid=14496," 0325 African Americans , 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0325 African Americans , 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0325 African Americans , 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0325 African Americans , 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," African Americans , American literature , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Du Bois, W.

In the case of the Philippines and Puerto Rico, the U.S. relied on U.S. styled education systems established during the colonial period, to function as ""technologies of forgetting"" and suppress memories that counter the narrative of U.S. imperial benevolence. This dissertation explores how Los Angeles Filipino American and New York Puerto Rican performance poets remember U.S. imperialism in the Philippines and Puerto Rico in the face of institutionalized efforts and social pressure that encourage systematic forgetting. These performance poets educate their communities about forgotten and current histories of U.S. imperialism to organize for social change but these histories are not institutionally recognized. My analysis relies on Foucauldian conceptualizations of the power of institutionalizing knowledge and the disqualified or subjugated knowledges that institutionalizing processes such as language policies, public education and assimilationist paradigms produce. Despite the U.S. nation state's resources for reproducing institutionalized histories, neither resistance to the narrative of U.S. colonial benevolence nor the histories this narrative omits can be completely eradicated. Instead, the reproduction of these subjugated knowledges takes place in alternative spaces and through alternative pedagogical practices. Examining the spaces and transnational practices that enable Los Angeles Filipino American and New York Puerto Rican performance poets to construct and reproduce historical narratives challenging institutionalized U.S. history, I argue that these performance poets trace a genealogy of global power that engages the politics of remembering U.S. imperialism to enable social change. Put simply, these poets reconstruct the past to imagine and work towards a different future. Making History from U.S. Colonial Amnesia acknowledges both how Filipino American and U.S. Puerto Rican performance poets make history by intervening in a politics of remembering U.S. imperialism and make history by actively participating in local and transnational social movements.",304878690,,Dissertations & Theses," Caronan, Faye ChristineCaronanChristineFayeCaronan, Faye Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1310423761 , 36465891 , 66569 , 3259634 , 3259634", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304878690?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans",," 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," American literature , Hispanic Americans"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Colonial , Filipino-American , Performance poetry , Poetic genealogies , Puerto Rican , Social activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+history+from+United+States+colonial+amnesia%3A+Filipino+American+and+United+States+Puerto+Rican+poetic+genealogies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Caronan%2C+Faye+Christine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"135,Fair trade and global justice: The radical possibilities of reform,"Fair trade has emerged in the context of various struggles, collectively termed the global justice movement, that challenge neoliberal efforts to deregulate international markets in the name of free trade. Although often characterized simply as an isolated reform initiative, the fair trade system exhibits radical possibilities when considered in the context of these struggles. With attention focused on a case study of fair trade banana production, as well as the literature on coffee, fair trade is itself treated here not as fixed in form, but as a site of struggle. Informed by a Polanyian perspective, moreover, the thesis argues that fair trade opposes reliance on the free market and presents an alternative that tends to re-embed the economy in social relations.

Long an important aspect of West African social, cultural, and political life, mobility in the region continues, although now mobile people cross the borders of what are relatively newly-defined nation-states. Most migration research in this region sees international boundaries as merely theoretical and unimportant to the lives of migrants, and empirical research on borders focuses on the ethnic groups living in border zones. This study explores everyday enforcement of international and internal mobility control, and the ways in which mobile Africans respond to and resist the actions of security agents. It incorporates an emphasis on the historical-structural aspects of African societies, while simultaneously retaining a focus on social relations that values individuals’ voices as they relate their lived-experiences. Drawing on theories of migrant networks, borders, and clientelism, I argue that important social interactions take place at internal and international mobility control checkpoints in Africa. I develop this argument using ethnographic evidence gathered when traveling over 10,000 miles in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, and Côte d’Ivoire over a period of nine months. Data come from participant observation at 23 international borders in West Africa, and 175 security control checkpoints in total. This evidence is supplemented by twenty-nine interviews with transportation workers across the four countries studied. I posit that borders are socio-economic, cultural, and political formations that affect individuals differently based on their social positions and transportation workers act to assist migrants in negotiating border crossings by engaging with security agents in ritualized and scripted interactions. Transportation workers play an essential, institutionalized role in mobility control in West Africa and the ties between security agents, transportation workers, and passengers are multi-level patron-client relationships based on the ideals of reciprocity, protection, and symbiosis. This analysis contributes to the social scientific understanding of African borders and the social process of crossing these borders, and they help to refine the current theorization of migrant networks. The findings have important policy implications for the movement of people in the region as well.",304883784,,Dissertations & Theses," Mechlinski, Timothy MarkMechlinskiMarkTimothyMechlinski, Timothy Mark",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1390310981 , 37710791 , 66569 , 9780549152774 , 3274435 , 3274435", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549152774, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304883784?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure," Social sciences , Burkina Faso , Cote d'Ivoire , Cultural interactions , Ghana , Mali , Mobility control , Negotiation , Political interactions , Social interaction , Supplication",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Negotiation+and+supplication%3A+The+social%2C+cultural%2C+and+political+interactions+of+West+African+mobility+control&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mechlinski%2C+Timothy+Mark&amp;isbn=9780549152774&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"137,Contemporary ruralities: Contrasting visions of food and agriculture,"This dissertation examines two contrasting visions of 'sustainable agriculture.' On the one hand, there is a 'global vision' for sustainable agriculture described in influential academic, policy and corporate circles. This vision finds that only industrial-scale agriculture is capable of meeting global demand for food, but it also recognizes the need to mitigate the negative ecological impacts of previous agricultural practices. It calls for a new 'green revolution' that would increase aggregate production while reducing the ecological impact of that production. In clear contrast to this global vision are the livelihood-centered, or 'local,' visions of two rural social organizations, the Italy-based Slow Food network and the international agrarian Via Campesina, the largest social movement in the world. Slow Food and Via Campesina visions of sustainable agriculture emphasize the place-based economic, social, and cultural production of smaller-scale agriculturalists. The organizations stress the landscape effects of heterogeneous production systems and ecologies. They seek place-specific, or endogenous, rural social and economic development, what could be called 'contemporary rurality.' Dissertation research was guided by the broad questions: how do these internationalist social movements envision development for rural places, and how do these visions differ from the dominant model of agricultural development? A second order of questions follows: what are the immediate goals of agrarian movements in relation to dominant patterns of agricultural development to date, how do movements attempt to achieve these goals, and what, at base, are their proposals for the countryside? These questions are addressed in three principal chapters. Chapter one is divided into two parts: the first describes the conventional arguments regarding 'sustainable agriculture' as they frame much of the debate of global food production; the second part offers critique of the FAO estimates and projections of demand that often underlie the argument for continued adoption of the corporate, industrialized model of food provision. Chapter two traces the history of post-WWII 'agrifood' systems and the rise of alternative agrarian movements in relation to these systems. Chapter three examines the politics embedded within specific projects for 'alternative' development, and the relation of these projects to the vision for a contemporary rurality.",304884198,,Dissertations & Theses," Niles, DanielNilesDanielNiles, Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1317326551 , 36584661 , 66569 , 3255019 , 3255019", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304884198?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0700 Social structure",," 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0700 Social structure"," Geography , Agriculture , Social structure"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agriculture , Food , Social movements , Sustainable agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contemporary+ruralities%3A+Contrasting+visions+of+food+and+agriculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Niles%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"138,"When the empire falls: The World Social Forum, between protest and political organization","Within the last decade, a new generation of activists has emerged to protest the increasing power of supranational financial institutions, such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and the World Economic Forum, and the accompanying deterioration of democratic structures and institutions in various regions of the world. The World Social Forum (WSF) was founded as a site in which these new social and political actors are attempting to move beyond protest and toward the construction of alternative, radically democratic social and political institutions and advocacy networks. This dissertation is a study of the WSF from the perspective of political organization, which problematizes the decades-old issue of the fragmentation of left-wing activism and corresponding debates over centralization and autonomy. It looks at the three most prominent groups in the WSF---anarchist and autonomist social movements, NGOs and other ""civil society"" actors and left political parties---in terms of their respective theories of social change and democratic praxis. It understands each of these groups as contemporary political organizational forms---with political assumptions, functions and power resources---that share a common opposition to neoliberal globalization, yet operate in contention with each other over issues of agency and social change. In addition, the text analyzes the WSF itself as a political organizational form, identified as an ""open space"" rather than an organization. It provides a theoretical discussion of the WSF's open space paradigm, both in terms of the way the space is theorized and produced, as well as the various concepts of openness its constituents employ. It argues that current conceptions and practice of the WSF open space tend to reiterate liberal democratic political forms rather than contest them. Given the WSF's objective to oppose neoliberalism, it recommends that the WSF adopt the alternative view of the open space conceived by autonomist social movement actors under the rubric of ""horizontalism.""",304889111,,Dissertations & Theses," Gautney, Heather DeniseGautneyDeniseHeatherGautney, Heather Denise",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1260822791 , 35659781 , 66569 , 3245034 , 3245034", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304889111?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory",," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0703 Organization theory"," Political science , Social structure , Organizational behavior , Organization theory"," Social sciences , Anarchism , Globalization , Political organization , Protest , World Social Forum",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+the+empire+falls%3A+The+World+Social+Forum%2C+between+protest+and+political+organization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gautney%2C+Heather+Denise&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"139,The alternative path to dignity and justice: Rethinking political opportunity structure,"This dissertation explores the political trajectory of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN), known as the Zapatista movement. The Zapatistas captured worldwide attention on January 1, 1994 when it seized four towns in Southern Mexico over the deteriorating economic conditions for indigenous people in the state of Chiapas. Peace talks began in 1994, but failed after the government rejected the 1996 San Andrés Accords. The conflict reached an impasse until 2001, when the Mexican government adopted the Indigenous Rights and Culture Law that effectively co-opted the movement's grievances. Usually, once a government adopts the movement's language, this leads to the movement's eventual disbanding. Yet, this does not appear to be so for the Zapatistas, which persist after thirteen years. This study examines the political, social, and economic environment that shaped this movement by revisiting the political opportunity structure (POS) model to clarify how the altered POS affects the strategies social movements employ. The methodology implemented in this study is qualitative in nature, with heavy emphasis on archival newspaper clippings, interviews with indigenous groups and organizations in Mexico, and anthropological studies. I reconfigure the concept ""political opportunity structure"" (POS) to account for the global influences and decipher how they have changed the domestic POS environment that movements operate under. This dissertation identifies several reasons behind the longevity of the Zapatista movement: a changed political opportunity structure in Mexico, a stronger civil society, and the EZLN's capacity to foster a solidarity network of transnational advocacy networks and develop connections at the domestic and international level. These new resources have led to the creation and maintenance of autonomous municipalities where schools have been constructed, medical clinics built, and other opportunities like trade via coffee cooperatives have flourished. This strategic shift is atypical and speaks to a larger trend we are witnessing in this global political opportunity structure. Thus far, these factors all demonstrate how the EZLN has carved out significant local autonomy for itself. The decision to practice autonomy is a sign that global forces in domestic POS are able to bypass domestic politics and offer movements another course of political action.",304889611,,Dissertations & Theses," Acevedo, EmilyAcevedoEmilyAcevedo, Emily",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1453192811 , 35659791 , 66569 , 9780549385981 , 3294587 , 3294587", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549385981, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304889611?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Dignity , Justice , Mexico , Political opportunity structure , Social movements , Zapatista movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+alternative+path+to+dignity+and+justice%3A+Rethinking+political+opportunity+structure&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Acevedo%2C+Emily&amp;isbn=9780549385981&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"140,The impact of changes in United States immigration policy on pre and post 9-11 international graduate students,"The horrific events of September 11, 2001 have been used as justification to transform through substantially more restrictive changes, the policy and law affecting the movement of persons, e.g., international graduate students, across U.S. international borders. This study is an interpretive policy analysis of the impact of those changes on pre and post 9-11 international graduate students. These policies are analyzed from the framework of a theory of immigration policy as social policy. Eventually, the focus of this study shifted to place the main focus on the students rather than the policy. Qualitative research methodologies were used to analyze official and related policy documents, newspaper, magazine, and journal articles, and data collected from interviews with international graduate student participants. Through a framework which focuses on values, beliefs, and feelings as meanings, or perceptions, these perceptions represent the students' sense-making values. Their values weighed heavily in their responses to the interview questions. The findings reveal that the ""picture"" of the United States presented by U.S. Consulates and the visa interview officers leaves a lasting impression on international graduate students who represent our future good will ambassadors.

Research in public health has shown the extent to which the social, political and physical environment affects human health. Structural violence exemplifies the way through which an oppressive and discriminatory environment is embodied as bad health outcomes. In most African countries where social structures shape the risk of disease and patterns of poverty, reflection on structural violence becomes part of bioethics and the search for social equity becomes the core of bioethics. Theological equality provides us with the religious foundation of equity and the option for the poor serves as the theological and practical warrant for equity. Bringing this social vision of bioethics into the universe of Christian churches forces us to challenge their social vision and public practices. It also forces us to question the Roman Catholic Church's polarization on individual morality in bioethics. As transnational institutions, Christian churches can play an important role in mobilizing those who, inside or outside the institutional boundaries of the churches, can bring this vision of bioethics into the realm of reality. The implementation of such a vision requires from the churches a sense of creativity that leads to the development of a social activism grounded in socio-political strategies and religious practices that address policy-makers and grassroots movements. The achievement of such a goal can only be done if local churches pay attention to what goes on their setting. Hence, it is important to re-define the Christian identity in connection to the challenges with which ordinary people are confronted and the ideologies that shape public decision making. The churches need to be at the crossroads of ideologies, that is, in places where important decisions that shape the well-being of masses of people and determine patterns of infection and morbidity are taken. In the other hand, the churches cannot stir up the implementation of such a vision if grass-root movements from African local churches are not empowered to effect changes in their neighborhoods and people trained to take care of their own health.",304897002,,Dissertations & Theses," Azetsop, JacquineauAzetsopJacquineauAzetsop, Jacquineau",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1514005981 , 36585581 , 66569 , 9780549473718 , 3301784 , 3301784", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549473718, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304897002?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology,, 0469 Theology, Theology," Philosophy, religion and theology , Africa , Bioethics , Community organizing for health , Health and human rights , Health and the common good , Health inequality , Preferential option for the poor , Structural violence , The future of an Afican bioethics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Preferential+option+for+the+poor+and+health+equity+in+Africa%3A+A+theological+approach+to+population+-level+bioethics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Azetsop%2C+Jacquineau&amp;isbn=9780549473718&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"142,Youth without sanctuary: The new ethics of humanitarianism in post -war Guatemala,"This dissertation concerns a movement for social reform, for and by children, that promotes reconciliation in the aftermath of the genocide (1960-1996). I explore how the peace process has reshaped indigenous rights, public accountability, and the politics of difference in the lives of young people. Specifically my dissertation examines the tensions between increased international support to end wars in negotiated settlements, the practices of peace workers, and the direct involvement of children in reconstruction efforts. Drawing upon two years of ethnographic research in the rural Ixil field office of a non-governmental organization Apoyo y Autosuficiencia in Guatemala and at a major philanthropic venture, the de Tong Foundation, in The Hague this research explores a campaign for social renewal that targets young people in an effort to secure peace. Paramount here is the prevention of death and the protection, management, and improvement of life. The emergent category of childhood in a pious highland town, notorious for its fragile peace, becomes a forceful means of cultivating citizens and fostering community in a post-war world. My dissertation begins by documenting how childhood emerges in Guatemala, through international intervention, as a category of law, popular imagination, and social policy stemming from the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. It highlights a shift that occurred in 1996 when young people became a focal point for local, national, and international policy makers in the struggle for security during peace processes. Contemporary discourses on childhood as a refuge for well-being preserved in youth resound with peacemaking efforts that aim to prevent further killing and protect human life. For many Guatemalans who continue to live with death as a part of their ordinary life, this sort of peace is simply unimaginable. My work describes life, without sanctuary, where parents wish their children would “learn to suffer well,” in an idiom of belonging and identity. This dissertation is part of a wider inquiry into the ambivalent promise and practice of peace. With this work I intend to generate an interdisciplinary dialogue about post-war reconstruction between anthropologists, policy-makers, political scientists, economists, and legal scholars that impacts the comprehensive reform of international peacekeeping missions. My contribution is a critical anthropology of violence that demonstrates the impossibility of separating social reform movements for peace from human experiences of war.",304900983,,Dissertations &

research of middle class have become domestic and international sphere of learning with the problem that highly paid attention to, and arouse the universal solicitude of the scholars such as politics, sociology as well as economics- Paper researching the major problem that will be discussed is the relationship between western middle class and social order in the modern course of social political, economic and ideological cultural changes- Paper research has adopted the theory of modernization in political sociology for background, and social stratified theory for analysis frame- It is in historical materialism and dialectics materialism as the foundation to study, and specific research technique are method of comparison, class analysis method, system method as well as the case method- Theory of the western research of middle class set up in advance is: Middle class experienced from industrial and commercial development and civil society is the social stratum and group with similar to self appraises, worth orientation, way of life and psychological feature as well， therefore, takes important affection in market orientation, stability and development of society- Paper major theoretical orientation is different from theoretical viewpoint of the ""stabilizer""， "" balanced ship "" , and "" buffer "" the etc- in western theoretical research of middle class- Paper theoretical starting point and the basic assumption that sustains are: Since modern social transition middle class has broken up, made up and developed that makes itself filling with contradictoriness, different quality and complexity, it is not one for class- From the visual angle of social systematic variable to analyze dialectically, in the diversity of market economy of the course of the modern development, promoting the diversity of benefit subject and diversity of value orientation, middle class not only behavior orientation and the group consciousness in realistic society is a complex variable, and is also an important variable in the relation of development and stability of society- In the countries of different political and cultural background, each still has different intension and feature- Therefore relation between middle class and stability of social order not only lies in middle class’ market ability, still depend on them whether have to win extensive cooperation and support of other social strata, mutually depend on it whether has the ability of participating in and promoting political democracy with the system background of country and society- This paper contains six chapters, which are outlined as follows: Introduction focuses on the reason and significance of the research, and summarizes the documents related to western middle class- At the same time, introduces the configuration of theory, basic concepts, research technique and major innovation- The first chapter discusses the theories of social stability and structural feature- This paper from the field of political sociology, thinks society stability be a complex systematic project of multidimensional degrees, its subsystems are depended on, interacted, restricted and affected mutually with dialectically unified relation- It is the comprehensive results of each subsystem developing to the stability of society- And middle class is variable and an essential factor in this systematic project only- Society stabilizes and develops should be the results of expressing benefits from each class and stratum of society in mutual competition, cooperation, compromise and balance, middle class can only is one of common winner in this kind of game- So the theoretical stabilizer that sets up in advance is not enough, merely a kind of static theoretical idea and unidirectional thought relatively- The second chapter is about the relation of western middle class and social changes from historical investigation- The paper relies on classical theory of Marxism as ideological guidance, does not think stability be the inherent feature or inevitable property of middle class, ""balanced ship"" and ""safe valve"" also do not be its congenital social function, commonplace, mild and conservative more do not be the social nature, and middle class has no fixed pattern in the course of social development- On the one hand, in the various stratum strengthens to pressure for political order, the middle class with benefit diversity and diversity of value orientation is often a kind of instability factor probably, on the other hand, each class in a society (include middle class) if can not get deserved social resource and system arrangement, it is the reason that it may form social order and normal to lose- Therefore how to guide, hold and develop the social function of middle class are still the important social program to the capitalist countries with different developing route- The third chapter focuses on the western middle class in class theory, it is the main part of this essay- This paper thinks the middle class with developing and changing, and then analyses from social systematic variance, though middle class in games of society with contradictory nature, it is a development variance of social development all along- Middle class regardless of opts what kind of role appeared in social political stage on, is compared by stratum strength and the expectation tension, as well as is political, economic, cultural background decided- They oppose and compromise, struggle and cooperation with each stratum, and insist to be subject of utility and interests in the choice of society politics, adjust goal with utility and interests to "" reasonably "" opt friend or competitor, middle class is hard to become leading class- Regardless of Theory of ""management revolution"" or Theory of ""revolution of science and technology"", the meaning is a kind of regulation in the field of private ownership only- Its limit is not destructive to bourgeois with controlling for enterprise efficiently as the watershed, it cannot be exceeded power boundary between the middle class and the class of upper levels- The fourth chapter thinks deeply from present situation about the relation of middle class and social order with the principle of Integration of theory with practice- This paper investigates the economic position、cultural life and social political attitude of middle class in the present western society，and thinks it has filled with multiplicity, contradictoriness and complexity- At the same time explains the pattern of middle class in language environment of western culture cannot be“clone”（only refer to，not copy to apply mechanically）with comparison, because economic and political positions of middle class are not firm, it is in course of breaking up and constructing continuously- So its intension that not only has difference in different ideology and the cultural background, also has different social attitude under different social stage and situation- Middle class should be the correspondingly developed concept in social historical development, is a concept of cultural and social space-time with discrepancy- Therefore the research for middle class cannot be static, especially for the country of ""post-development form"" can not ""consume theoretically"", otherwise will be impossible to understand the developing feature of society really- The fifth chapter is from the viewpoint of analysis of system to discuss the system, organization and mechanism for stability of social politics in western developed countries- It emphasizes mutually positive exchange between country and society, and to promote and regulate and maintenance the relation between country and society with mutually positive exchange should be political system, arrangement of system as well as orientation- At the same time, this paper tries to combine the tendency of diversity in present western society, to discuss political running form of present western society, it is not the pattern of class or stratum, and appears mainly with the forms of benefit group and social organization- Because of class, the ability of engagement in political action has been weakened by social diversity, the built-in benefit of class is nearly impossible, and the development of related the profession, occupation with more close benefit has replaced the organization role of class gradually- Different groups of middle class are playing their social political roles in the benefit groups with background of profession and occupation- Under the restraint of social order and system, benefit group or social organization as the political participator become the effective mechanism of benefit expression and balance, makes social tension keeping in controlled and helpful for society to stabilize- Finally, though political systems in western developed countries have drawback and are faced with problem and challenge, the essay considers that developed countries do not go through coup and the revolution from long-term, the public holds certain political identification for system, institution and policy, and has reflected the legality of regime and authoritativeness of government- On the other hand, capitalist to be not enclosed, rigid system, it is a kind of civilization impacted, adjusted, transformed and developed continuously by socialist criticism and lash- Presently capitalism is still developing continuously, it is explained that the system and institution arrangement have certain reasonability and meet foundation and development of social politics, economy and culture- Though western society movements to ebb and flow, can be controlled with various means in the scope that public order allows in, and various incidents can be also dissolved in the scope of system configuration and legal system- The channel of public leading off, benefit expression and politics participation is unblocked, it makes one-side social problem do not be gather and become comprehensive social problem，and local social conflict or upheaval、riot will not be brew and develop to social crisis with overall situation- Consequently, from the viewpoint of political sociology, stability of social politics in western developed countries relies on function of stability that political system and institutions have with，and can not be divided with the function of the political structure and system that maintain the balance and stability of various power relations, and this is not only relying on middle class or market power-",1024943127, 西方中产阶级与社会稳定研究,Dissertations & Theses," Shen, Ying RuiShenRuiYingShen, Ying Rui沈瑞英",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

People are in the aspects of theories the important reason that creation perplexity can return knot as roughly then as follows what time: 1.The extreme complexity of the social economic activities. 2.The saved economy, social theoretical are not perfect. 3.Put forward the fit social economic theoretical are difficult.

There are two outstanding issues: one is knowledge economy, and it is also called information economy, new economy; the other is economic globalization. Economic globalization is an unchangeable developing trend of the contemporary economy of this world and its influence has been taken great consideration by international society gradually. In recent years, anti-globalization movement has also occurred in the world. wherever there are meetings of economic globalization, thousands and thousands of people or more coming from all parts of the world will protest against it. To some extent, anti-globalization has become another kind of globalization. Economic globalization has existed for a long time, the globalization that occurred in the late twentieth century is another round of globalization. Anti-globalization is a new problem that occurred with globalization between the twentieth and twenty-first century. We must say that they have the same root. Although economists have already had common sense that economic globalization is an inevitable trend of development of social productive forces，they still have different opinions about anti-globalization. This paper is to study why people protest against globalization, what kinds of influences economic globalization has actually brought to developing countries, how developing countries should face economic globalization, what China’s strategies are and so on. There are altogether four chapters in this paper. Chapter One mainly expounds the general understanding of economic globalization. It introduces the definition and process of economic globalization, why economic globalization has occurred and the main characteristics and substance of economic globalization respectively. Chapter Two is the analysis and thinking of anti-globalization. It includes the general review of anti-globalization, the main body and causes of anti-globalization and the characteristics of anti-globalization. Chapter Three expounds the influences of economic globalization upon developing countries. It discusses the opportunities and challenges which economic globalization has brought to developing countries and how developing countries should face economic globalization respectively. Chapter Four is China’s strategies. It contains that China should adapt itself to historical trend and greet economic globalization actively, defend state economic sovereignty and guarantee economic security, push on adjustment of internal industrial structure considerably, make sure to carry out the strategy of developing China vigorously with science and education and take an active part in international economic cooperation. Nowadays world economy has been connected closely very quickly, and it has never been so quickly before. All countries of the world has never truly felt that they depend on each other so much like now. Especially in the economic field, their connection is so close that economic problem of one country will immediately affect the general operation of world economy. Economic globalization is an unavoidable trend. To analyze it carefully and make proper choice is a vital subject of the times. As a practical trend, economic globalization belongs to economic category in nature. After analyzing it carefully, we can find that it has close relation with development process of transnational economy, market enlargement of economic development and motive to chase profit of microeconomic bodies. The characteristics of economic globalization mainly includes globalization of market economy, globalization of trade, globalization of production, globalization of enterprises and globalization of finance. In view of the nature of economic globalization, it is a complicated social economic phenomenon which has many sides and meanings. In view of the development of productive forces, it has close relation with the development of science and technology revolution, information industry and so on. Due to the rapid development of global information system and especially internet, the process of new globalization is occurring. In view of productive relations, up to now, economic globalization has truly developed with global enlargement of capitalist productive mode. As an outcome of development of human society productive forces, economic globalization can both promote development of social production and satisfy the needs of it, and this is a kind of historical progress. However, as enlargement of capitalist productive mode to the whole world, it is good for developed countries to maintain the old order of world economy. Economic globalization has brought unfair and unjust opportunities for developed and developing countries. The nature of economic globalization is an adjustment process of industrial structure which is led by developed countries and mainly promoted by transnational corporations in the world. In recent years, while promotion of economic globalization has become essential trend and main aspect of world economic development, however, it has occurred an opposite anti-globalization phenomenon, and it is getting more and more intense. According to statistics, larger scale anti-globalization movements happened seven times in 2000 and six times in 2001 in the world. Whenever an important international economy, trade or finance meeting is held somewhere, there will be such kind of protest movements outside the meeting, moreover, protest masses often get into conflicts with policemen. Why is anti-globalization so active while economic globalization is developing so rapidly? It is necessary for us to examine such a phenomenon in a rational way. Just as globalization is inevitable and unavoidable, anti-movement is also the same and has become the focus of international society. How should we understand the current anti-globalization phenomenon? We think that globalization and anti-globalization can’t be separated. With the development of globalization, its disadvantages have begun to affect a lot of people’s benefits. Whatever they are developed countries or developing countries, they must both obtain huge development opportunities and face new challenges and threatens in the process of economic globalization. Generally speaking, with improvement of degree of globalization gradually, all countries of the world will face the situation of uncertainty and no safety in financial field, employment environment, income assurance, policy behavior and so on. From this point of view, anti-globalization becomes the natural choice of maintaining economy security and benefit of one country. We should point that just like the definition of globalization, people’s understanding to anti-globalization is also extensive, uncertain and different. In many circumstances, anti-globalization is in fact equal to anti-economic freedom and anti-freedom trade. Nowadays, phenomenon of anti-globalization is not a trend of thought any more, but becomes a kind of world movement. Economic globalization is an objective requirement of the advanced development of socialized production. Under the influence of science and technology and system innovation, social productive forces have been increased greatly. Furthermore, it has speeded capital flow of the world, enlarged international market and made economy of all countries more open, therefore, the trend of economic globalization can’t be stopped any more. To all developing countries, economic globalization is not a choice any longer, but a kind of reality that we must face. In general, economic globalization has two sides, and it has both advantages and disadvantages to all developing countries. On one hand, it brings opportunities and benefits for developing countries. For example: productive factors of developing countries can flow freely and be well assorted in the world; developing countries can absorb capital and technology and advanced management experience of developed countries; it can also fasten its pace to catch up with and exceed developed countries. On the other hand, economic globalization can also bring risks or even disasters for developing countries, and it can challenge economic sovereignty, economic risks and sense of value of developing countries. If they don’t take it seriously, they will meet great difficulties for it. Therefore, all developing countries must learn to take advantage of it and avoid its disadvantages. They should take part in and take good use of the trend of economic globalization actively, and involve itself better in it as soon as possible, Or they will be left behind by human civilization. Economic globalization is a profound revolution and trend of the times, and it is also unchangeable. It is impossible for any countries to avoid the trend passively and protest against it. If so, they themselves will be harmed greatly. Facing the unchangeable trend of economic globalization, the only and correct choice of China is to take part in it actively and depend on the collective force of developing countries in order to take good use of the advantages which economic globalization might bring and good conditions it might provide. In this way, China can obtain forward position of world economy as soon as possible and change its unfavorable position. In view of strategies, China should think about our current economic situation and all relations completely. Upon objective and calm analysis, we must both see the bright prospect of economic globalization and think about the problems that may occur completely, and then prepare strategies to involve ourselves into the process of economic globalization actively and welcome challenges bravely. We should make proper choices which are in conformity with the situation of our country, take good use of advantages of economic globalization and avoid its disadvantages surely, control these double effects, obtain development opportunities and enable the economy of our country grow rapidly as soon as possible. Shortcomings: This paper points out that economic globalization has led to and intensified further imbalance of world economy development, and its main expressions are: The difference between south and north countries is becoming larger and larger; Developing countries are further left behind developed countries; Especially, it makes the bottom poorest developing countries poorer and poorer. However, this paper can’t find proper methods to solve these problems. Furthermore, the problem of how developing countries and China should establish more perfect economy safety-proof system is still to be further studied.",1026869059, 经济全球化及其对发展中国家的影响与中国的对策,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Xin ShuZhangShuXinZhang, Xin Shu张淑欣",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714629271 , 70534652 , 189128 , H393450 , H393450", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 经济全球化及其对发展中国家的影响与中国的对策,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026869059?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH393450 , Social sciences , developing countries , economic globalization , influences , strategies , 发展中国家 , 对策 , 影响 , 经济全球化",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Economic+Globalization+and+its+Influence+upon+Developing+Countries+and+China%27s+Strategies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Xin+Shu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"146,City Social Security Economic Analysis and System Choice in China,"1. selected topic goal Looked from the international scope, it is very important that the social security system movement steadily. The social security is the economic system and the social system to maintain social stability, promote economy development, relate the entire members of different social classes vital interest. In the modern economy development, the perfect social security system throughout is one of the goal and administration primary missions the various countries' government diligently strives after. In the long-range view, the social security system directly will affect a national development advancement. In the past more than 20 years, along with market economy reforming and the economical globalization influence, our country social security system has been experienced the significant reform and system reformation .In 1984, Carrying on the partial areas' state enterprise staff retire expense social overall experiment as the beginning, our country social security system advances gradually. In 1995,the State Council had determined the basic social security pattern of social overall plan which unifies with individual account, emphasized the necessity of establishing multi-level social security system. In 1997, The State Council has further been clear about the basic old-age insurance system unified pattern. Although the mechanism adjustment and system construction aspect has obtained the certain achievement, but the question still be a lot, mainly includes that excessively attaches to enhancing the economic efficiency and promoting economy growth goal, but social justice and redistribution and so on social goal takes insufficiently, this already has the question of a political nature, the artificial fault and non- rational decision-making malpractice. Looking from the current situation that, our country cares for the aged the reality which the safeguard system faces difficultly mainly includes two aspects, one is the traditional debt quantity too huge, another is future population old age pressure. Future quite long section of times will be special for our country social security system reform development, China mainly will be in the digestion of serious history cloth wrapper and population old age pressure, throughout will face the contradiction of the social security supplies ability not being able to meet the actual need .This situation even more requires the country to master plan and reasonably disposes social resources, promote our country city social security system steadily movement, smoothly cross the future population peak . This request must earnestly consider and balance the history and the future relation, practically solve the two prominent problem, one will be the finance question, another is the management question. For long time, the social security system has been a hot topic of international and domestic research and also exist deep theories and practice background. The pattern choice question Manifested a country social security system strategic direction, the academic circles care for social security system pattern choice regarding the society and its the policy management aspect. This indicated the entire society cared for the aged the safeguard policy still to be at the choice stage, the new system also not completely finalized, from constructing the socialism harmonious society in the goal to look, it needed to carry on further again construct to existing system. In the harmony social transformation period, further investigate our society reform direction and the path doubtless have important theoretic and realistic meaning. Presently, our country social security pattern, the pension supply and demand, the investment and the management question regardless of or the practice application aspect still has the important research value in the theory, but at present still had the certain difference to this topic discussion, some domains even appeared the directive opposition opinion, it needed further to distinguish falsely saves really, clears off the mentality, put forward the beneficial proposal to reform our country city social security system. Precisely based on the above background, this article key by the above question took the research the central content, choose ""our country city social security economic analysis and the system choice"" took the research topic, attempts to these questions does further explores. 2. Research mentality and method The social security question involves the economic, sociological, the politics, the demography, statistics, ethics many disciplines, is a multi-disciplinary overlapping research area. This article stresses to conducts the research from the economic angle.The research way of thesis is that around our society system evolve , combined together according to the theories and the policy, Qualitative analysis and Quantitative analysis, the realistic and prospect, based on drawing lessons from international experience and carrying theories analysis , introspecting our society system reform, having a foothold in realistic background and basic state of the nation,the thesis mainly analyzes our society system mode to choose, pension supply and need, fund investment and management, and put forward a principle policy to suggest to aftertime's system reform. In the methodology, the paper take the dialectical materialism and the historical materialism scientific methodology as the instruction, persisted historical and logical unification, from generally to concrete, from simplicity to complex, specifically analyzes the actual problem. In the concrete research technique, the paper has alternately utilized kinds of methods: First, unifies the standard analysis and the real diagnosis analysis, stresses on the real diagnosis analysis. The article analyze the city social security goal pattern, finances, the management ""must be any"" the question from the multi- angles, thus more uses the real diagnosis analysis method. Second, unifies the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis, stresses by the qualitative analysis primarily. Revolving the city t social security goal pattern, finances, manages three kind of research subjects, the paper mainly analyze the rationality of system choice from the qualitative angle, and takes the auxiliary method by the quantitative analysis. Third, unifies the longitudinal historical analysis and the crosswise reality comparison, stresses by the reality research primarily. The paper while the massive analyzes history background, origin, are more through clears off the logical relations research question, the historical analysis serves for the reality research. Fourth, unifies the international experience with the Chinese national condition, stresses by the Chinese national condition primarily. Based on the general inspection international experience foundation, the paper key discuss the condition and so on such as domestic society, economy, politics, population, finally carries out to the system and the policy research. 3. Chapter structure The text is totally of 6 part and divide the line to three great part of: The first section is the introduction .The second part constitutes chapter 2 and chapter 3, mainly draw lessons from international scope reform experience with carry on society security system theories analysis, use this as the third part system analytical foundation; The third part constitutes chapter4, 5,6 and7,analyze our society system mode to choose, pension supply and need, fund investment and management. Chapter 1 mainly clarify the theories and practice meaning to choose title, overview domestic and international theories research present condition and theories result about society security, explained a research way of thinking and method, at last elaborate the structure frame, main standpoint of full text and creative section. Chapter 2 elaborates internationally social security system reform. First section based on discriminating the senior citizen, cares for the aged, social security connotation foundation, proposed the social security have the public product attribute in the overall, and analyzed the economic society realistic root which the modern social security system produced from historical and the logical angle. Second section based on summarizing the western theory achievement in the foundation, analyzed three stages of the modern social security system produce, development and the promotion . Third since section has for analyzed the internationally specific economic society background of the social security system reform since the 20th century 70's, refines four stages of the system reform internationally, summarizes the pattern reform model practice such as Europe and America, Chile, Sweden. The fourth section summarized internationally three rules and six enlightenment of the social security system development. Chapter 3 carries on social security economic analysis. First section analyzes the economical total supply and demand question under the pay-as-you-go system and full-fund system, discussed the different pattern's deposit effect, the economical growth effect and labor supplies decision-making influence. Second section based on population old-aged as the background, through analyzing different system’ pension income, compares relative suitable condition of the two system. Third section proposed system switcher need the certain condition, and faces a bigger uncertain determinism, merely impossible through the adjustment system pattern fundamentally can’t effectively solve the question which the social security supplies is insufficient. Thus, adopting Aaron condition analysis, the thesis prove that at present and in the future the sum of the rate of the population growth and wages growth will be bigger than the market actual interest rate in China, completely matching Aaron condition, thus China don't have the inevitable request of the endowment insurance transition. Fourth section separately reasoning the two system balance function between supply and demand, carry on the analysis to the adjustment factor, and made two kind of supplies patterns’ economic efficiency the comparative analysis. Chapter 4 emphatically discusses our country city social security system choice question. The first section discuss value idea question about our country system reform. Has proven the dialectical unification relations which fair mutually relates with the efficiency, proposed should take ""be mainly fair first"" as the system construction basic criterion; Proposed our country needs to be clear that the government take the final responsibility, carries on the reasonable role adjustment in the different project, and further standard local authority's property rights and governance. Second section carries on the real diagnosis analysis to social security system choice question. While summarizing the prominent question，forecasting in certain time economy, the society, the population factor, judging overall situation, proposed the reform basic duty of next step be guarantee the national security smoothly to cross the population old age peak, and further proposed some views such as system design not to be able to leave the specific national condition, the system nature goal should first the system outside-economy, reasonably appraisal system function. Third section analyzes our country city social security goal pattern choice. The research proved completely the full-fund system' impossibility as the goal pattern, raised that should persist the fund overall plan in the revenue and expenditure dominant position, the partial full-fund system only should become currently finances pattern transition goal, pay-as-you-go system still need to become basically the future goal pattern. Chapter 5 key research our country city pension supply-demand question. First section elaborated the importance of strengthening the pension supplies management, analyzed the localization question of national, the enterprise annuity, the commercial insurance in the multi-level pension supplies system. Second section analyzes the financial supplies question of our country city social security. The paper suggested unceasingly expanded the social security insurance coverage advancement, at present our country social security insurance overall plan level still should put province level, adopting individual account of records account type gradually to solve the pension ""the empty account"" question. Based on researching recessive debt foundation, analyzes through debt financing, the special channel financing feasibility, and proposed in grades establish social security insurance finance backlog system in the national scope. Third section analyzes supplement social security insurance supplies question. Separately carries on elaborate the enterprise annuity, the commercial insurance, and proposed the concrete suggestion of speeding up supplement social security insurance. Fourth section analyzes our country city pension demand adjustment question. In the analysis to old age demand level and structure foundation, the paper research the actual influence of retirement policy to the pension demand, suggested reasonably adjusts the pension treatment condition, and pay attention to family and the social function. Chapter 6 mainly discusses our country superannuation fund investment utilization question. First section researches interaction mechanism of superannuation fund and the capital market, key has carried on the analysis to our country superannuation fund investment operation possibility and the feasibility. Second section analyzes the different superannuation fund reasonable investment scope, proposed need further to attempt the innovation investment domain, conducted the research to the superannuation fund investment risk - income non- difference curves, the investment profolio effective boundary and the most superior combination. Third section analyzes the supervising and managing pattern choice question of our country social security fund with emphasis, and carried on the discussion to the superannuation fund international investment supervising and managing question. Fourth section proposed the national social security fund function localization for the national long-term finance strategic reserve, and proposes the concrete policy suggestion on the fund origin channel, investment channel, the nature and so on. Chapter 7 specially analyzes our country city social security management question. First section in summarizes our country social security management system vicissitude course in the foundation, the paper analyzes extant prominent question and government's responsibility question in social security management, proposed the future government will have mainly to carry on the indirect socialized management through the market, suggest at present our country must establish the management system which unifies disperse and concentrates, and carry on the discussion on the power and responsibility question to between the central authorities and the local authority. Second section firstly analyzes the connotation and type of the social security tax and the social security, inspects overseas social security ""expense"", ""tax"" reform development course, proposes our country still did not have the condition of levying the social security tax. Third section centrally elaborate the practical significance of bringing social security into line with the budget management after the, the analysis proposed in short-term our country still will need to use ""the general budget + social insurance fund budget"" pattern, and thought had to establish the social security budget's special status in the budget system. Fourth section summarizes the contemporary world social security law system construction experience, analyzes the prominent question which our country social security legal system construction faces, and makes conceives on our country social security legislation system, the reasonable plan social security legislation, put forward further some proposals to perfect the social security judicature mechanism . 4. Main conclusion and policy suggestion The thesis’s independent results of research mainly include: The first, through analyzing global social security system evolution path ,the thesis sum up three laws of social security function to continuously extend, system differently to develop and welfare benefits rigid growth, put forward standpoints that system design should went with economic development in response to, insist socialization reform direction, value not-economic factor difference, seek to continuously balanced development, gradually perfect law system and adjust sound management system etc. The second, the thesis analyze different social security mode’s economic effect. In the aspects of saving effect, the analysis think that full-fund system have no exaltation function to the society saving , pay-as-you-go system act on private saving, its function degree is mainly decided by population growth rate and interest rate. In the aspects of economy growth effect, the analysis think that under the in short supply condition, full-fund system will be more advantageous to help the economy to increase, but in the in-short demand condition, pay-as-you-go system will be more efficient, requesting that social security mode design should consider economic conditional conversion. In the aspects of labor supply effect, the analysis think that personal labor supply decision will be free from the influence of endowment insurance tax rate; Under pay-as-you-go system condition, endowment insurance tax rate will influence personal labor supply decision. The third, adopting over-lapping generations model, the thesis analyze different social security mode relative superiority or inferiority and condition in population aging setting. Being in relative lower population aging level, pay-as-you-go system will be profitable in pension. But with degree to deepen along with the advanced age, pension profitability will continuously decrease. When population aging rate turn degree to attain certain level, complete or part full-fund system will be relatively beneficial choice. The fourth, the thesis positively analyze social security mode transition. From the angle of social security actual product supply, solving population aging problem have to build up the foundation on which the society total product increase，system difference will mainly come from the influence on increase in the society total product and allotment power. Full-fund system will be advantageous only under more flourishing capital market, more safe fund investment, higher long-term investment income, especially under the social security critical shortage of supply condition, mode-adjusting can’t effectively solve shortage of supply. Adopting Aaron condition analysis, the thesis prove that at present and in the future the sum of the rate of the population growth and wages growth will be bigger than the market actual interest rate in China, completely matching Aaron condition, thus China don't have the inevitable request of the endowment insurance transition. The fifth, analyzing our country’ social security system movement situation and environment, the thesis put forward social security supply ability can’t satisfy actual demand in China’ social security system movement in the future, it is critical that economy efficiency is not high as a whole. The basic mission of next move reform is not choice what system the mode be the superior, but what system the arrangement can even insure a national security to successfully pass through population age to turn high peak. Thus suggest to put together the orchestration to the current urgent problem and the farsighted important problem knot to resolve, dividing reform target into short-term and long-term two stages with different mission respectively, in the short run to insist combined mode and in the long-term when the population advanced age gradually turn the trend of stability still practice target mode of pay-as-you-go system. The sixth, the thesis put forward an initial balanced analysis frame of pension need to supply, on this ground in studying the foundation of pension need to supply connection factor, analyze adjusting pension need to supply outlet in different mode.. Thus suggest set up our country’ multi-layers pension supply system and reasonably regulate retirement age and pension treatment. The seventh, see from the nations, financing form of social security system in the whole world on the whole experienced a ‘fee → tax → fee’ ‘z’ graphemic turns and twists iterative reform road. The thesis put forward our country still don't have to begin to collect social security tax, ‘changing fee to tax’ isn't suitable for at present basic state of the nation, the answer is mainly that social security is not agree with ‘changing fee to tax’ characteristic, conflict with current system design, can't adapt system diversity to request, is not agree with to match current society security reform direction. The eighth, on approving the foundation of pension balance special of the insurance fund, the thesis put forward that China need to insist by stages and by step development direction of building up a sound social security budget. China should still adopt ‘general budget’ +‘social pension fund budget’ mode under the current condition. See from future development direction, the thesis suggest that China establish pension fund budget mode. 5. Paper deficiency Limited by the knowledge and the energy, the paper still had some deficiency, many places even possibly had bigger errors and omissions, from now on need to continue to study and to deepen, mainly included: First, because this article is new exploration to our country city social security system reform, restrained to myself economic theory foundation of basic skills and the innovation ability insufficiency, the article's analysis and research is only preliminary, the theory construction possibly appears roughly, certain links theory elaboration still had to be stricter, the content between the chapter sometimes had the intrinsic joint insufficiently meticulous problem. Second, this article lies in the theoretical analysis and the system choice discussion with emphasis, only for the realistic our country city system reform to provide a policy guidance mentality and the frame, reform suggestion mostly is directive, less from the concrete standard, the technical method angle thoroughly launches, need more consummations and in feasible aspect proof. In brief, in the writing process, I once wanted to do the comprehensive thorough research to social security system reform question. Along with the research and ponder thorough, I discovered this topic has involved the massive complex staggered contradictions and the question, although has made the extremely great endeavor, but constrained to this domain quite unfamiliar, in fact certainly not completely implements the original research mentality, has not been able truly to achieve the anticipated target, needs to perform in this domain to solve in the next step of research.

This thesis adopts the definition of social security in a broad sense. Namely, social security is the general designation of a variety of socialized living guarantee systems, which provide economical welfare to all citizens. In this sense, social security includes income security, social assistance, and social welfare in a narrow sense. In this thesis, the right of social security is not only the right of workers, but also the equal right of the whole population, in terms of basic human rights. Clearly, the Nation State is under the obligation to guarantee this right. Regarding workers, the right of social security consists the right of relief, the right of social welfare and the right of health. The socialization of social security requires the State to take positive measures to provide economic security to all in need, because of sickness, employment injury, maternity, invalidity, death, old-age, unemployment and so forth. At the same time, the State should try for the improvement of public health and social welfare. In the legal relations of social insurance, workers enjoy the right of social security since they fulfil the obligation of laboring, thus, workers and trade unions are the main body of right. Correspondingly, employers and government act as the main parts of obligation, taking charge of paying premium, financial support and operating social funds. In this thesis, social security, social welfare and social protection are interchangeable. After a brief review and analysis of the origin and legitimacy of the social security right, this thesis focuses on existing international labor standards related to social security. In the context of globalization and increasing inequality, this thesis mainly evaluates the content, implementation and effect of social security standards. Based on up-to-date social security standards and the welfare state mode of Germany, the thesis put forward main strategies to implement the right of social security in China. Ⅰ. Main content of this research The first part (the second chapter): The nature of social security right, which introduces the definition, origin and development of social security, and legal analysis of the right of social security. Social security is the general designation of a variety of socialized living guarantee systems, which provide economical welfare to all citizens. The right of social security is not only the right of workers, but also the equal right of the whole population, in terms of basic human rights. Clearly, the Nation State is under the obligation to guarantee this right. Since the early stage of industrialization, social security has developed from punishment to right, and from relief and insurance to comprehensive security. The system of social security in a modern sense still has legitimacy in terms of social and economic sustainability. Human being still suffers from all kinds of social risks, such as sickness, old-age and unemployment. To protect its most priceless natural resource, provide the sustainability of market competition, and share the achievement of social development, most countries all over the world develop their own social security systems in succession, although in very different ways. Social security is not a luxury, but a civil right which should be guaranteed by the State. In terms of laws, the right of social security is defined by many international covenants as a basic human right. In addition, it is social right and an individual labor right, namely the right of relief for employment. Within the structure of industrial relations, workers and trade unions take the right, while employers and the State bear obligations. The second part (the third chapter): International labor standards related to social security, which mainly analyzes the content, implementation, effect and principles of these standards. So far, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has set 31 conventions and 23 recommendations regarding social security. Since 1919, social security-related labor standards have made progress from social insurance to comprehensive social security, and from covering a part of wage-workers to the whole population. In those up-to-date standards, the No. 102 Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention provides minimum levels to 9 risks, medical, sickness, unemployment, old-age, employment injury, family, maternity, invalidity and survivors. Besides, in these 9 areas (except family benefits), there are specific standards based on No. 102 convention, but with higher protection in terms of coverage and beneficiary levels. In addition, regarding migrant workers, ILO has set special conventions for them. In future, social security conventions may become more flexible in terms of approach and management of social security systems, but some core principles will not change, such as the minimum coverage, minimum benefit levels and State guarantee. Conventions and Recommendations are by nature universal in their vocation, because of the democratic standard-setting procedure and tripartite mechanism. As benchmark conventions, the social security standards aim at spreading the concept, thus their factual influence is far beyond the scope of the 41 countries, which have ratified the No. 102 convention. In view of the flexibility and objective, all member states of the ILO are called upon to achieve these standards, irrespective of their level of economic development. The third part (the fourth chapter): The background and evaluation of social security-related international standards, which mainly analyzes why the social security need internationalized standards in the context of globalization, and evaluates the scope of content and factual effects of current standards. This thesis deems that it is necessary to constantly evaluate and modernize standards, but standards are even more relevant today than in the past. Under globalization, increasing inequality, exclusion, uncertainty and informal economy indicates the necessity of social security. At the same time, changing economic situations, for example, lean, cooperative, participative and decentralized production systems, and the development and use of advanced technology, all show that economic success depends heavily on human resource development. In practice, more and more countries begin to establish or consummate their social security systems according to international labor standards. Even in the retrenchment of some welfare states, the reforms more focus on the efficiency of the system itself. In a word, it is no doubt that socials security will still exist. Of course, social policy is based on national level and related to its economic development. But it is clearly that a principled and supra-national defence of social standards is necessary as a complement to the national defence of social programmes. In particular, globalization has reduced the effectiveness of national standards, Thus, standards must be international in scope. The standards set by the ILO tripartite mechanism, through democratic procedures, are universal in content and legitimate in process. Those standards set the model for national social security legislation. After the WWII, common labor standards accelerated world peace, social justice and social goal of economic development, and also the unification of labor legislation in different countries. The basic idea of the ILO is ‘to put labors out of competition’, namely, in the reality of global inequality, these standards provide the same platform to provide basic social protection to workers all over the world, and let capital and enterprises compete on the market. In terms of the content, the existing standards are not too high, but relatively inadequate. The design of minimum standards plus flexible clauses is feasible both in developed and developing countries, since it is left to each state to build up its own programme according to its own needs and its stage of development. After the WWII, while flexible clauses further allow different management approaches, basic principles like state obligation remain. However, in the context of globalization, social security standards could further extend, such as extending to informal sector, and taking into consideration of linking social security legislation for labor flows between different countries. Regarding the implementation of these standards, the ILO is partially toothless. Firstly, the ratification of conventions is voluntary. Secondly, although the complaints procedure and the possibility of investigation give some teeth, compliance remains voluntary and largely a matter of persuasion. Besides, in theory, the ILO has the possibility of sanctions, but it has never happened in practice. Thirdly, the ILO has recognized the problem of unequal economic capacity of nation states, but has not attempted to link standards in any systematic way with levels of economic development. The last but not the least, the ILO's remit is limited to employment-related matters and does not extend to social protection of the population as a whole. In particular, social security conventions have not experienced the same degree of dissemination in the ILO member states as labor law conventions; What is more, the strong focus on the core labor standards could push social security into the background internationally. In fact, the design of flexible standards allow the progressive extension of protection in line with the development of national legislation and capacity to implement the convention. Moreover, a convention or recommendation is conceived as a set of firm criteria for the preparation of national legislation. Besides, technological assistances by the ILO have far-reaching significance to social security legislation and capability-building in developing countries. Since social security standards are benchmark, although only 41 countries have ratified the No. 102 conventions, they are much more influential than this. The fourth part (the fifth chapter): the implementation of the rightofsocial security: country files. In this part, based on the ratification situation of China, the problems of social security system and legislation in China, and the reference of German experience, the thesis mainly researches on feasible ways of implementing the right of social security in China. The implementation of international labor standards should be finally carried out in domestic levels. The social security standards need to integrate into national legislation, and the right of social security will be fulfilled in the country. Until now, China has not yet ratified the No. 102 convention. In the 23 conventions that China has ratified, there is limited content related to social security. At the same time, current social security system in China has many problems, such as the inequality of social security right, serious drawbacks related to coverage, fund gap and low financial support, out-of-date social security legislation, etc. In such situations, as one of the members of the ILO, China should refer to conventions and recommendations as guidance of legislation. With the technological assistance of the ILO, in proper conditions, China should ratify social security conventions as soon as possible. Secondly, China could strengthen its social security legislation, with the demonstration of international standards. As a country which firstly set social security legislation, Germany owns a comprehensive welfare system from ‘cradle to the tomb’. The legislation and industrial relations, which highly promoted the development of social security systems in Germany, are worthy to use for reference. Third, we must emphasize the tripartite mechanism in the ILO. In China, the role of trade unions should be enhanced. In modern China, it is fair to say the chaos of social security system and violation of social security right closely relate to the situation of industrial relations. In the transition from the benefit unification in the Planned Economy to cooperative labor-capital relations in Market Economy, the contradiction of immature industrial relations leads to the absence of guarantee of labor rights, including social security right. The history shows that the enforcement of the right of social security in Germany is one result of the advanced mode of industrial relations, such as labor movements, social partnership, collective bargaining, co-determination and so on. Therefore, the industrial relations in China need to develop in the direction of models as in advanced market economies. Through strengthening the representative function of trade unions, establishing participative management system, emphasizing the quality of collective agreements, we could ensure the implementation of labor rights, including the right of social security. Ⅱ. The innovation and disadvantage The innovation： 1, This study analyzes the legal nature of the right of social security, the principles, implementation and effects of related international labor standards systematically. 2, It mainly focuses on three debatable questions: if the social security standards are still up to date in the context of globalization and global inequality; whether the standards are too high or too low; over-regulative or toothless. The conclusions are as below: it is necessary to constantly evaluate and modernize standards, but the concept is still up to date; social security standards should extent, for example, to informal sectors; current international standards has no power of enforcement, and the ILO promotes the implementation of conventions and recommendations, mainly through supervising mechanism, moral shaming and technological assistance. 3, In terms of international labour standards, this thesis researches on how to implement the right of social security at domestic levels. With the reference of Germany, it is practical for China to protect the right of social security in three ways: ratification of labor standards, strengthing national legislation based on conventions and recommendations and adjustment of industrial relations, particularlly emphasizing the role of trade unions. The disadvantage: In some parts of this study, there still lacks in-depth analysis. Ⅲ. The significance of this study In terms of theoretical significance, this study attempts to summarize the existing researches and improve understandings in the fields of the right of social security and international labor standards. At the same time, I expect this study may inspire some new topics. Therefore, the research of social security and international labor standards could become a series of study. Practically, this thesis probes into the strategies to protect the right of social security in China, by ratifying and following international labor standards. At least, more attention could possibly be attracted to labor issues, in particular, the problems of social security and international labor standards.",1026906095, 社会保障权与国际劳工标准：以中国为例,Dissertations & Theses," Luo, Qi SiLuoSiQiLuo, Qi Si罗斯琦",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714932231 , 70581782 , 189128 , H394928 , H394928", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 社会保障权与国际劳工标准：以中国为例,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026906095?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy,, 0630 Public policy, Public policy," (UMI)AAIH394928 , Social sciences , international labour standard , the right of soical security , 国际劳工标准 , 社会保障权",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+right+of+social+security+and+international+labour+standards%3A+the+case+of+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Luo%2C+Qi+Si&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"148,Protection of Children in Armed Conflict,"International law attempts to afford civilians special protection from the effects and inhumanity of armed conflict. While, the forms of violence today have given rise to an increase in the numbers of civilian victims, and particularly of children, who, an account of their special vulnerability, are the most seriously affected. The active participation of children in hostilities, too, is a disturbing factor serious enough to justify the increasing attention the subject is receiving within the international community. Current statistics, however, portray a sobering and distinctive trend in modern warfare: the deliberate victimization of children and the blatant disregard for their human rights. Despite the United Nation's (UN) remarkable achievements with peace-keeping missions, ethnic conflicts continue to arise and new states continue to expand the international community. At least three hundred thousand children, some as young as eight years old, currently serve in armed conflicts around the world. This Note focuses on international attempts to protect children in armed conflict and reduce the use of child soldiers. The global community must work collectively to update existing international laws to reflect the increased participation of children in hostilities and to initiate the necessary enforcement and rehabilitative mechanisms. International Humanitarian Law governs the conduct of armed conflict and impose restrictions based on moral, legal, philosophical, religious and political considerations. Current international humanitarian law, as defined in the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, the two additional Protocols of 1977 attempts to insulate children from the tragedies of war. The injuries children receive as a result of modern warfare, however, affront the underlying humanitarian ideals that motivated the creation of these laws. Moreover, the continued use of child combatants illustrates the international community's failure to protect the world's children. To place this issue in perspective, the writer then illustrates the current condition of child soldier in different counties especially in Iraq and Africa. Deliberate targeting of children in modern warfare and the increased use of children in armed conflict badly hurt children and violate their human right. The most serious aberration from international humanitarian ideals, however, stems from the recruitment and utilization of young boys and girls as child soldiers. International human rights law embodied in the CRC currently sets the minimum age for recruitment and participation in armed conflict at fifteen years of age; however, children as young as seven continue to serve in armies across the world. Besides the forced recruitment, a vast number of children voluntarily join the military regimes. Often the culture of violence, the desperation for food, the need for security or the drive to avenge the deaths of family members prompts such unforced recruitment. The motivation of children to arm themselves includes war, poverty, education and family ect. Without addressing the roots of the conflict, children will continue to volunteer; therefore, even if the international community establishes an effective ban on forced recruitment, it alone will not suffice. Effects of Warfare on Children are wild and serious. Malnutrition, disease, sexual exploitation and physical injury constitute only a few of the tangible wounds deliberately inflicted on children. The suffer of psychological trauma as a result of armed conflict becomes an incurable hurt on their innocent heart. International Criminal Court (ICC) as we know was constructed to prosecute those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The July 1998 Rome Statute of the ICC established the recruitment and use of child soldiers under the age of fifteen as a war crime. Together, these two movements have the potential to provide better protection for the world's youth and a means to enforce and to punish those who violate human rights treaties. Besides the ICC, the next Part enlists documents of international laws that focus on children. In 1924, the League of Nations unanimously adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, thereby adopting the first global charter focusing on children's rights. In 1948, the UN General Assembly proclaimed the equal and inalienable rights of all human beings, regardless of age, by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The first UN instrument devoted solely to children's rights is the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959 which sets forth the best interests of the child standard and demands that those responsible for education and advisement utilize this standard as a guiding principle. Entering into force in 1990, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) served as a milestone in the establishment and recognition of children's rights. While as the sole super power in the world, the United States does not support the CRC and will not endorse global efforts to protect children from the atrocities of armed conflict. Its attitude of opposition to efforts promoting a global agreement to ban the use of soldiers under the age of eighteen badly hindered the international effort of protecting children in armed conflict. Therefore, the U.S. Congress finally adopted a Congressional Resolution condemning the use of child soldiers in the Defense Appropriations Authorization Act for 1999. Even the Resolution does not bind the United States, it constitutes a significant step in the right direction. To stop the use of children as soldiers and improve their statue, the writer puts forward some suggestions as follow: Ratify the Optional Protocol on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and other legal instruments relevant to the protection of children in armed conflict. Ensure that national laws are compatible with international legal standards. Promote systematic demobilization of child soldiers in all countries. Build capacities for appropriate psycho-social support and response to ex-child combatants. Develop prevention strategies to reduce the factors that make children vulnerable to ""voluntary"" recruitment. The International Committee of the Red Cross legitimately labeled the twentieth century, the ""century of war."" In the past century, the line between civilians and combatants blurred, military groups deliberately targeted and recruited children and entire generations have grown up amidst armed conflict. Concurrently, the twentieth century produced universal humanitarian treaties that imposed limits on warfare, afforded children special protection and specifically recognized the inherent rights of the child. Unfortunately, problems remain in the effectiveness and enforceability of these rules of law and as a result, children remain vulnerable to the tragic effects of armed conflict. The international community must implement stronger standards that reflect the global awareness and sensitivity toward the plight of the world's children. The international community must work together to monitor human rights violations, to demobilize child soldiers and to prosecute offenders. To create a more humane world and to further improve the status of children, the international community must use its collective authority to ensure that states observe the standards aimed at protecting the world's children.",1026907913, 论武装冲突中的儿童保护,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, FangWuFangWu, Fang吴芳",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714935371 , 70534812 , 189128 , H392846 , H392846", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 论武装冲突中的儿童保护,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026907913?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAIH392846 , Social sciences , armed conflict , children , 儿童 , 武装冲突",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Protection++of+Children%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A+in+Armed+Conflict&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Fang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"149,The Universal Socialism Movement Under New Changes of the Present Capitalism,"How to understand the universal socialism movement under new changes of the present capitalism? The spokesman for capitalist system always attempts to prove that the capitalist system has already undertaken radical qualitative changes and it can last forever, under new changes of the present capitalism. Also, some criticisms of capitalism then has often neglected the breadth and depth of these new changes and underestimates the difficulties that capitalism brings to the universal socialism movement. The ideological difference about this question also affects ponder on socialist development strategy. Historical experience on the universal socialism explained that it is a question of life and death to socialism whether we can understand the universal socialism movement under new changes of the present capitalism with scientific attitudes. After World War II, present capitalism has had a series of new changes: (1) high development of social productive forces; (2) significant transformation of productive relations; The state owned economy becomes the foundation of national monopoly capitalism; the share system economy becomes the universal economy organization; Transnational monopolistic organization develops rapidly; Monopoly capital is internationalization;(3) complication of society class structure; The interior of bourgeoisie divided, the internal structure of the working class has had the change, and the new intermediate class appeared.(4) delicacy of political rule form. The citizen’s rights expand further; the national legal system degree enhances greatly; State economy and society's function enhances greatly; The Surveillance and the restriction mechanism to the national right organization strengthen further. Reasons for these changes mainly are: (1) boost from the third technical revolution; The Science and technology revolution not only promoted the enhancement of the labor productivity, and material conditions of the reproduction in creating industry extension, but also founded the emerging industry, developed the realm of production breadth and the depth, expanded the international domestic market.(2) intervention and adjustment of capitalist countries; In the Post-war, capitalism nation not only interfere and influence society economy developing process from the exterior by various policy means ,and involves directly the social economy life with a great deal of national investment and national consumption. (3) result from unreasonable international relations; After World War II, the western developed country obtains huge profits in the world market, making use of main and monopoly status in the economy and science and technology, and the unreasonable international division of labor system. Unless this, it controls and exploits the developing country with various economic means. (4) socialism movement influence; with the socialist countries as the capitalist country opposite and initially demonstrated the huge superiority, the capitalism for strengthen own cohesive force to counterbalance the socialism the attraction, carries on a series of self- adjustments, the improvement and the improvement to the capitalist system certain concrete links and the movement management mechanism, including some ways of drawing lessons from the socialism. (5) working class unceasing struggle. Along with the development of labor movement, bourgeoisie regard the improvement concessions as one dominant method and the management day by day, to maintain own political power, delays own demise. The same violence suppression union use or use in turn, to improves the opposition social revolution with the society, with the partial restoration capitalist system opposed the working class overthrows the bourgeoisie political power with the revolutionary method. Contemporary Marxists and socialists must see the new changes of the present capitalism dialectically: be fully aware of capitalism vitality, and be confident of the inevitable historical tendency of capitalism extinction. The contemporary capitalism development variety expresses that the contemporary capitalism can adjust within the scope of system, can also continue to hold the development of the productivity. The capitalism hasn't walked in the end. So we should know and estimate capitalism vitality fully, but new variety of contemporary capitalism didn't change capitalistic essence. Its basic contradiction didn't exterminate not only, instead expanded by the new form and the characteristic in the global scope, intensifies and has had other a series of contradictions: The global problem is increasingly serious; The world economy develops unbalance, the north and south disparity enlarges; Between the developed capitalist country capture the world supremacy the struggle to be intense; The capitalist country interior class contradictions still existed Obviously, So the capitalism new variety cannot change the tendency which the capitalism inevitably perished. The new changes of the present capitalism indicated the present developed capitalist countries developed to a stage of more stability and vigor. This has brought new difficulty for the universal socialism movement.(1) stern challenge on traditional socialism theory; The traditional scientific socialism theory ,which concerning the proletariat revolution path, revolution motive, the standard of the social class divides theory and so on ,all faces the new challenge. This ask scientific socialism theory, particularly about the capitalism theory should at fulfillment in with enter all, develop continuously. (2) serious external pressure on realistic socialism. After World War II, the developed capitalist country carries out politics, economy and the thought culture comprehensive seepage to socialist countries, through using economy and technology superiority of history forms. They lure these socialist countries to leave the socialism track, resubmits the capitalism the social system and the universal system mainly depends on the non- war, peace method. The socialist countries carry on the socialist construction in the economical globalization and under the expanded to foreign countries opening up condition. So it should have intercourse with the different developed capitalist country in various aspects. This provided certain conveniences objectively for the capitalism containment and the subversion socialism. This indicated that, ""the peaceful evolution"" and anti-""peaceful evolution"" is long-term, the arduous struggle relating the socialism future and the destiny, therefore we never can regard it idly as of no importance, drop with light heart. Therefore, contemporary Marxists and socialists must see socialism with type of development vision: be fully aware of inflection and difficulty that socialism is faced with, and be confident of the inevitable success of socialism. In the human history, the alternates of each society form is long-term, complex, the winding repeatedly struggle. Any kind of social system all unwillingly withdraws from the historical arena, the capitalism also is so. It will use inevitably each self-adjustment method to alleviate the basic contradiction, and delay its limited life. The socialism demonstrated its huge superiority, from the birth, the development, to the reform, the consummation, until defeats finally the capitalism. Of course, it needs a quite long historical period. Obviously, it is a long process that the socialism replaces the capitalism. We both must fully know and estimate the twists and difficulties socialism meeting, and must believe the socialism inevitably replace the capitalism. Postwar, the huge growth of the capitalist society productive forces creates absolute and essential actual premise for the future socialism new society. And its consummation and development in market economy also creates the condition for socialism production organization form and the formation of socialism ""new person”. In addition, under the globalization condition, new changes of contemporary capitalism pushed an international community and contact mutually, increasing mutual dependence, and understands between the countries. The action of contemporary capitalism self- adjustment also has the certain model significance to the socialist countries. The globalization creates world production system, financial system, knowledge system and management system. That makes the contribution for effective disposition resources in world scope, and finally realizes the socialism and the communism preparation material and technical foundation. The existing socialist countries have obtained the degree different development in the reform. This indicated that its prospect is bright Correct understanding of new changes of the present capitalism provides scientific basis for formulation of our international strategy. (1)It is the basic guarantee to realize “two necessities” that socialist countries strengthen the exemplary role and attraction of socialism in the universal socialism movement and gain advantage over capitalism. Therefore the socialist countries have to develop the productive forces strongly, and absorb and draws lessons from civilized achievement of contemporary capitalism new change. So they can develop themselves using the capitalism, fully displays the superiority of the socialist system. This is an important strategy in adapting the capitalism new change, and realizing the long term goal of the ""two necessities"". (2) It is an important factor to realize “two necessities” that working class and political parties in capitalist countries adapt to the new changes of capitalism, adjust strategy, save strength and continue to play the main role in transformation of capitalist countries. We believe, through a long winding process, “two necessities”, Marx’s scientific judgment and the magnificent prospect for final substitution of socialism for the capitalism will certainly turn to be true.",1026923898, 论当代资本主义新变化下的世界社会主义运动,Dissertations & Theses," Pang, Rui XuPangXuRuiPang, Rui Xu庞旭瑞",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715045911 , 70534732 , 189128 , H372361 , H372361", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 论当代资本主义新变化下的世界社会主义运动,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923898?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH372361 , Social sciences , New changes , Present capitalism , Universal socialism , “Two necessities” , “两个必然” , 世界社会主义 , 当代资本主义 , 新变化",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Universal+Socialism+Movement+Under++++++++++++%0A+++New+Changes+of+the+Present+Capitalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pang%2C+Rui+Xu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"150,The Situation Strategies of Port Illegal Immigrant under Globalization in China,"Under the rapid development of globalization, there is a pace-fast in the flowing of world population, but this has caused some unusual movement of population to be in vogue. Meanwhile, situation has become more complicated in the fight against stowaways. We are currently facing a big challenge on the entrance management work. This article has tried to analysis the counter-sneak crossing through the back ground of China and the difficulties. We have also profits from the overseas some successful procedures to tries hard to explore countermeasures to suit our country national conditions. From the governor's angle, the essay has collected the massive sneak crossing data and the cases, and unifies the correlation theories like game theory, the policy decision science theory and so on. At the same time, we unify using the sampling inquiry and the case survey, and has analyzed our country port illegal immigrant's historical situation and the present situation under the globalized tendency condition. So we summarized our country port illegal immigrant characteristic and the trend of development, and summarized the illegal immigrant harm, such as the difficulties of affected our country normal international order and the international relations, the international image and the international fame, the threat to stowaway own safety and so on. On this basis,the essay analyses different roles that immigrant countries(global factors),the relations betwwen the immigrants and immigrants organisers(domestic factors),and executive departments(management factors) play in terms of game theory, as well as discusses reasons of abroad the illegal immigrant activities on the ports of our countries under global trend. By taking management experience in and abroad into account,the essay proposes some helpful strategies,for example,to put making the anti-work more stronger and taking more control on the agencies as head of all anti-illegal immigrant work.And in order to strenthen the management function,the goverment should make use of tecnical inspect,complement all relative laws and regulations,and make a well-performed team.In the aspect of monitoring illegal immigrant activities,our government should make more internation coopration,mobilize all social power to resist illegal immigrant activities,to make a good international environment and atmosphere for good immigrant relations betwwen china and other countries.",1026924180, 我国口岸偷渡现状及应对策略,Dissertations & Theses," Zheng, TongZhengTongZheng, Tong郑通",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715049471 , 70534812 , 189128 , H336883 , H336883", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 我国口岸偷渡现状及应对策略,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026924180?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAIH336883 , Social sciences , Anti-illegal immigrant , Illegal immigrant , Port , 偷渡 , 口岸 , 非法移民",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Situation++Strategies+of+Port+Illegal+Immigrant+under+Globalization+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zheng%2C+Tong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"151,Environmental governance in international banking: Exploring the emergence of the Equator Principles,"Voluntary business regulation at the transnational level is becoming a significant feature of global environmental governance. The thesis considers the origins of the Equator Principles, a voluntary code of conduct created by commercial banks to manage environmental and social risks associated with project financing in developing countries. Based on the operational policies of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the framework has thus far been adopted by over 60 commercial banks since its launch in June 2003, representing over 85 percent of the global project finance market. The thesis argues that the rise of private environmental governance in the commercial project finance market is closely linked to the emergence and diffusion of environment and social norms in the international system. It traces the normative origins of the Equator Principles to the theory and practice of environmental project review first institutionalized at the World Bank in the early 1970s, then later expanded and applied to the IFC's private sector projects as well. The thesis argues that the rise of a corporate accountability movement in the financial sector was the principal reason why commercial banks decided to collaborate and create a common industry standard based on environmental and social norms institutionalized in multilateral institutions. It makes three main contributions to our understanding of private environmental governance formation. First, the power of transnational advocacy groups to influence corporate behavior is determined by the legitimacy of the norms they promote as well as political opportunities presented by market structures. Secondly, international organizations are increasingly facilitating and legitimizing voluntary business regulation as the most effective institutional form of governance for integrating public interest concerns into transnational markets. And third, voluntary business regulation, such as the Equator Principles, is positioning private actors and forms of authority at the center of transnational rule-making processes, producing systems of rules that both challenge and reinforce international law, regimes and institutions.",1617955283,,Dissertations & Theses," Wright, ChristopherWrightChristopherWright, Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3473806311 , 89950682 , 189128 , 9781321336948 , U615685 , U615685", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781321336948, English, English,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617955283?accountid=14496," 0439 Environmental Law , 0601 International Relations , 0770 Banking"," 0439 Environmental Law , 0601 International Relations , 0770 Banking"," 0439 Environmental Law , 0601 International Relations , 0770 Banking",," 0439 Environmental Law , 0601 International Relations , 0770 Banking"," Environmental Law , International Relations , Banking"," (UMI)AAIU615685 , Social sciences , International banking",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Environmental+governance+in+international+banking%3A+Exploring+the+emergence+of+the+Equator+Principles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wright%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781321336948&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"152,Probe analysis and strategy research on the problem of brain drain for liaohe research institute,"Translation from original language as provided by author China's reform and open marks that we step into a period during which our country is changed from a traditional society to a modern society. One of this period's character is re allocation of vast social resources a reconstruction of social resources allocation system. This kind of social resources movement on ownership and allocation and re-allocation causes a series of social structure changes. The brain drain is one of the most important form of this movement .Over the whole social view, the brain drain is necessary requirement that makes human resources allocated better, and sufficiently utilizes the talents, but for the enterprise,the brain drain becomes a problem which administrators man generally concern with.

It succeeds in combining social development goals with public concerns, and becomes a multidimensional complex construct. The scientific measurement of social development needs the methodology support. The social indicators movement of the 1960s provided the essential tool in due time and positively impelled the research of social development all over the world. Social development may be estimated by some social indicators which form the corresponding systems. The expansion of research areas develops and perfects these systems. A number of international scholars who study in modernization have managed to establish a series of comprehensive indicator systems of economic and social development since 1960s,such as the Indicator System of Modernization Related to Economic Growth and Economic Structure, 10 Standards to Measure Modernization, PQLI, ISP, HDI, Social Indicator System of OECD, GPI, ASHA, European System of Social Indicators and so on. As a new kind of concept of development, the concept sustainable growth emerged at the end of 1970s, which was followed by a series of indicator systems measure sustainable growth. For example, Sustainable Growth Committee of U.N. proposed Indicator System of Sustainable Growth in 1966. British Government proposed Indicator System of Sustainable Growth in 1964 and USA proposed the report ""Sustainable Growth Strategy of USA-Sustainable USA and New Common Knowledge"" in Feb of 1992. The research on social development indicators has experienced two stages in our country, namely, theoretical research and applied research. The earliest indicator system of social development was our first ""Draft of Social Statistic Indicator System"" in 1983, established by State Statistic Bureau. The year of 1989 saw the adjustment and revision for it on the basis of years of experience. Entering 21 century, Macroeconomic Research Team of State Planning Commission drew up The Indicator System of Social Development on the basis of Marxist historical materialism, taking account of the habitual mode of Chinese Government and latest theoretical development in this field nationally and internationally. And this has been the most scientific indicator system of social development. According to the tendency, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Statistic Bureau and Research Centre of Chinese Commission of sciences proposed their indicator system of social development respectively. Research on comprehensive indicator systems also concentrated in the field of well-off society. Before the 16th NCCPC, the representative research outcome included Indicator System of Well-off Society of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Indicator System of Well-off Society of State Statistic Bureau. After it, the representative projects under processing or already completed included ""Well-off Society Establishment-A Framework of Development Adapts MDG"", hosted by Pro.Zhou Changcheng, Center for Quality of Life Studies, Wuhan University,; Indicator System Framework of Well-off Society, proposed by Pro.He Keng, State Statistic Bureau; the Value of the Object of Well-off Society, proposed by pro.Zhu Qingfang, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Comparing the national and international indicator systems of social development, they both lack of theoretical foundation, which is regarded as an inevitable question in establishing indicator systems. The national and international indicator systems of social development have a lot of common in content. In the aspect of evaluated method, national indicator systems of social development are less advanced than international indicator systems of social development, which devalue the credibility of the outcome. They all act on describing the situation of social development, evaluating level of social development and promoting further social development. The research on indicator systems of social development in our country begins later than that abroad, which enables us to take the vast advantage of their achievement in order to make the research better. To start with, it is essential to study in establishing theoretical foundation of indicator systems of social development. Next, attach emphasis on subjective indicators and combine subjective indicators and objective indicators. Moreover, it is necessary to make up the defect of method already emerged from the reality of China and create more scientific and effective method. At last, pay more attention to comparative function of indicator systems of social development, and establish comparative system of social development state",1874979408,,Dissertations & Theses," Deng, XinDengXinDeng, Xin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319365561 , 111157022 , 189128 , 10519291 , 10519291", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874979408?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," (UMI)AAI10519291 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Summary+of+social+indicator+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deng%2C+Xin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"154,Early twentieth-century avant-garde book design: An agentive vehicle for social change,"The increasing dominance of visual communication puts pressure on professional communicators and students of rhetoric to understand the nature of the scopic regime and how competing ways of seeing affect communication networks and the societies they serve. This document focuses on the attempts of the early twentieth-century avant gardists to profoundly shift social realities by challenging the scopic regime of their time through book design. Their attempts to seize agency through aesthetics failed to directly enact a new social order, but the avant gardists succeeded in establishing the necessary visual grammars for new ways of visually presenting information, including the International Style. This current (and global) scopic regime embraces a particular relationship among text, image, and reader that allows us to cope with the cacophony of information and objects. To understand the International Style and other competing ways of visual communication, one must understand the major movement that came before: the Avant-Garde, which itself included movements we now call New Typography, Suprematist, and Constructivist. Principally building upon Richard Lanham’s assertion that we live in a “economy of attention,” Karlyn Kohrs Campbell’s notion of agency as promiscuous, Anthony Giddens’s work on the duality of social structures, and Martin Jay’s conception of the scopic regime, this document traces the work of key avant-gardists and in so doing adumbrates how book design has combined and continues to combine aesthetics with social action.",193335663,,Dissertations & Theses," Proulx, Shannon KellyProulxKellyShannonProulx, Shannon Kelly",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1584070701 , 39689561 , 66569 , 9780549685852 , 1454648 , 1454648", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549685852, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/193335663?accountid=14496," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Design , Interior design , Language , Rhetoric , Composition"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Avant-garde , Book design , Book studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Early+twentieth-century+avant-garde+book+design%3A+An+agentive+vehicle+for+social+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Proulx%2C+Shannon+Kelly&amp;isbn=9780549685852&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"155,Bailaremos: Participation in morenada dance fraternities among Bolivian immigrants in Argentina,"Recent analyses of migration have asserted that globalizing forces and increasingly transnational flows are not erasing the nation-state but are in fact reinforcing the strength of ethnic and nationalist identifications. These analyses have overwhelmingly been based on studies of South-North migrations, and they have largely relied upon Western models about the nature and development of national identities. We still know little about the social and cultural impact(s) of globalizing and transnational forces on migrations and movements outside the North, migrations which would allow us to question whether such models of 'nation' and 'ethnicity' are sufficient for characterizing the variability of responses to local and global forces. This ethnography explores the relationship between transnational movements, globalizing forces, and cultural production in a case from the understudied phenomenon of South-South migration. I focus on participation in morenada dance fraternities, considering participation as a multi-party activity, talk and embodiments that involve various social projects; ideas about self and society; and the physical and social structures of the environment. I argue that through participation, forms of nationalism are being deployed that do not necessarily correspond to dominant models; that locally defined and highly variable notions of ethnicity are being (re)formulated; and that alternative modes of identification which vary according to gender, generation, and experience are being mobilized in attempts to refashion what it means to 'be Bolivian' in a milieu of global politico-economic change and local social marginalization in Argentina. Over the course of research the word "" participación "" itself frequently emerged in conversations, not as an unmarked descriptor of activity but rather as a justification for belongings, rights, privileges, and obligations. In this thesis I also consider how discourses about participación shed light on the relevant forms of belonging and related ways of being agentive. Ethnographically, this work supports others that have described the emergence of new status criteria and forms of distinction among minority groups often depicted as homogenous. It also highlights the emerging importance of informal labor ties, folkloric practice, and transnational cultural production in the on-going formation of immigrant identifications.",193483780,,Dissertations & Theses," Carmona, AliciaCarmonaAliciaCarmona, Alicia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1546790871 , 38859201 , 66569 , 9780549568636 , 3307731 , 3307731", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549568636, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/193483780?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Argentina , Argentina immigrants , Bolivia , Bolivian immigrants , Bolivian immigration , Dance fraternities , Immigration , Morenada",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bailaremos%3A+Participation+in+morenada+dance+fraternities+among+Bolivian+immigrants+in+Argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carmona%2C+Alicia&amp;isbn=9780549568636&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"156,Immigration justice: A proposal for developing just admissions policies,"The central thesis of this dissertation is that just immigration policies may not avoidably social groups that are already unjustly disadvantaged. This principle challenges three common views in philosophical and popular discourse on immigration justice. First, it rejects the view on which the sovereignty of states includes the discretion to choose admissions criteria in a way that is morally unencumbered. Second, this principle denies that states may justly choose immigration policies according to nationalist principles of political morality. Finally, though I argue that states' immigration policies are subject to cosmopolitan constraints of justice, I dispute the most widespread view among cosmopolitans on immigration: that liberal states ought to open their borders. In the first half of Chapter 1, I survey salient empirical data on the patterns and causes of contemporary global migration, and I briefly review extant international law on immigration. While the UDHR guarantees the rights of domestic movement, non-expatriation, exit, asylum, and return, international law is silent on states' obligations to non-refugee immigrants. In the second half, I consider two challenges to the relevance of my topic to political philosophy. Chapters 2 and 3 critically examine extant philosophical proposals for regulating immigration. Chapter 2 assesses a variety of nationalist moral arguments for regulating immigration. I reject each of these proposals on both general, anti-nationalist grounds and for proposal-specific reasons. Chapter 3 considers several cosmopolitan proposals for regulating immigration. Though I share the cosmopolitan commitment to the moral equality of citizens and foreigners, I find fault with all extant cosmopolitan proposals. Chapter 4 explicates the aforementioned principle in terms of four questions: What is a social group? When is a social group disadvantaged? Under what conditions is disadvantage unjust? When does an immigration policy avoidably harm a social group? Chapter 5 defends this principle. First, I argue that states' sovereign authority over immigration is constrained by principles of justice. Second, I argue that nationalist principles of political morality are inappropriate for evaluating states' immigration policies. I argue, third, that states must give absolute priority to the welfare of unjustly disadvantaged social groups in the selection of immigration policies.",193987101,,Dissertations & Theses," Higgins, Peter W.HigginsW.PeterHiggins, Peter W.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1584072051 , 39954881 , 66569 , 9780549673620 , 3315825 , 3315825", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549673620, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/193987101?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," Philosophy, religion and theology , Admissions policies , Cosmopolitanism , Immigration , Justice , Nationalism , Sovereignty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Immigration+justice%3A+A+proposal+for+developing+just+admissions+policies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Higgins%2C+Peter+W.&amp;isbn=9780549673620&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"157,Greening law: A socio -legal analysis of environmental human rights in India,"In this dissertation, I examine how India has addressed the question of environmental human rights in the context of three green issues on water rights, forest conservation and air pollution. The dominant disciplinary frameworks on environmental human rights focus on effective compliance with international norms in domestic legal order. They see the internalization of human rights through the adaptation of a set of parallel global standards. Law and Society scholarship argues that acceptance of uniform application of rights masks the interrelationship between international human rights law and local normative orders. I study the process through which environmental human rights claims are incorporated in domestic legal cultures. Taking a socio-legal approach to the historical development of environmental rights in India, I offer some insights about the nature of legal pluralism in a postcolonial context. In this study I demonstrate that acceptance of cosmopolitan environmental standards in India is built through a plural framework of law that incorporates international environmental norms, constitutional principles and local customary practices. It is based on the interplay between different kinds of laws and also social and cultural assumptions about the proper relationship between individuals, groups, and the natural world. This, I argue, has been facilitated by the public interest litigation movement in the judicial process which introduced two important changes in the law- (1) it enhanced social and legal interaction by enabling social actors to approach the court and (2) liberal interpretation of rights. This marks a significant departure from colonial common law assumptions about the law and peoples' relationship with nature. I conclude that the adoption of a plural legal approach facilitated by public interest litigation has led to the internalization of cosmopolitan environmental jurisprudence in India. My aim is to provide through case studies an understanding of how human perceptions of relationship with the natural world influence the socio-legal framing of environment. My study demonstrates concretely the ways in which local social factors affect the acceptance of global norm.",250725337,,Dissertations & Theses," Padhy, SanghamitraPadhySanghamitraPadhy, Sanghamitra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1564022871 , 40513691 , 66569 , 9780549606826 , 3311071 , 3311071", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549606826, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250725337?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Law , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Comparative and international law , Environmental rights , Human rights , India , Indian supreme court , Law and society , Legal pluralism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Greening+law%3A+A+socio+-legal+analysis+of+environmental+human+rights+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Padhy%2C+Sanghamitra&amp;isbn=9780549606826&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"158,"The political economy of local currency: Alternative money, alternative development and collective action in the age of globalization","For the past 17 years, Ithaca, New York has been the site of an experiment in alternative money. Parallel to the dollar, the Ithaca HOURS paper currency commands a share of the local economy, circulating within a bounded area around the town. Ithaca HOURS are one of the most prominent grassroots manifestations of a diverse and prolific global social movement of alternative currencies, emerging in response to the adverse economic, social and ecological effects of globalization. The movement brings the question of financial structures to bear on the discourse on globalization and development, which have tended to neglect the role of money as an element that not only enables and measures, but influences and shapes economic realities. An alternative form of money with bounded, circulation is a tool to support local economic activity, encourage fairness and social equity, and promote environmental sustainability. This work is an ethnographic examination of the Ithaca HOURS system, tracing the course and effects of the HOURS economy on the ground, given the theoretical and pragmatic challenges in envisioning and enacting sustainable alternatives to global capitalism, and the dynamics of defining ""the local"" and engaging ""the community"" in a socially complex setting. Ithaca is part of the economically depressed ""rust belt"" and the site of two major educational institutions. A distinctly diverse town, characterized by a highly progressive community Ithaca is also marked by racial, ethnic and class inequalities. The HOURS economy is small, with significant variation among users. While the system has made some inroads it has not broken through present divisions of race and class. For users, however, HOURS affect social relations through consumption. HOURS offer a different way to trade in which users have more of a say as to what is important and how it may be measured. The money used colors the experience and understanding of material exchange, as different currencies codify different ways to consume. This challenges the neutrality of money, indicating that the discourse on sustainability needs to re-problematize not only trade but also its medium.",275979964,,Dissertations & Theses," Papavasiliou, FaidraPapavasiliouFaidraPapavasiliou, Faidra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1679672521 , 42537761 , 66569 , 9781109017014 , 3344479 , 3344479", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109017014, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275979964?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," American studies , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , Collective action , Consumption , Currency , Globalization , Money , Political economy , Social movements , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+economy+of+local+currency%3A+Alternative+money%2C+alternative+development+and+collective+action+in+the+age+of+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Papavasiliou%2C+Faidra&amp;isbn=9781109017014&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"159,Revolution from the aisle? Anti-biotechnology activism and the politics of agrifood restructuring,"Genetic engineering as scientific practice and a package of social relations has deeply marked the global political economy. Yet, the future of agricultural applications is uncertain. In the United States, the global leader in GE production, the industry's dominance is challenged by a growing opposition movement intent on slowing commercial introductions, increasing regulation and shifting decision-making power from biotechnology corporations to citizens. Geographers and agrifood scholars herald this movement as a critical point of resistance to the forces of political economic change. Indeed, to the extent that activists question corporate power, neoliberalization and agricultural industrialization they can playa crucial role in determining social, economic and environmental relations within and outside the food system. However, at present, there has been little assessment of the significance of contemporary tactics, strategies and practices. This project offers the first systematic examination of the movement in California, a centre of research and development and grassroots activism. Using case studies of GE Free Sonoma and the Non-GMO Project, I document the history, effect and potential of organized campaigns and the everyday practices of rank-and-file volunteers. I argue that although the movement developed as a way to oppose the environmental and social injustices of neoliberalization, it also reproduces problematic social and economic cleavages and neoliberal rationalities. In the first section, I trace the development of California's GE Free movement and the implications of GE Free Sonoma's campaign discourse. I then explore the unorganized tactics of the group's volunteers through the concept of everyday resistance . The discussion pays particular attention to the complexity and increasing use of consumer and market-focused activism. I argue that “voting with your dollar” can be a neoliberal conceit or a possible route to alternative economies. Activism simply needs to step out of the supermarket aisle. The second section continues this examination of market tactics and assesses the consequences of the Non-GMO Project's proposed Non-GMO certification. After reviewing the group's history, I discuss the economic, regulatory and biological obstacles to negative labelling. Ultimately, this study is intended as both a critical challenge to activism and a resource to strengthen radical agrifood politics.

Previous interpretations arguing for American exceptionalism and insulation from international influence have been revised as historians examine the American past through a transnational lens. Our understanding of lrish-American history in the nineteenth century, particularly the process of ethnic nationalism, is conspicuously in need of revision. Irish-American participation in Irish nationalism demonstrates the continued importance of events in Ireland on the history of the Irish in America. My dissertation examines the complex interplay of nationalism, ethnicity, class, and gender in the shaping of Irish-American ethnic identity. Such an examination is important not just for understanding Irish-American history but for understanding what it meant to be ethnic and American in the late nineteenth century. My dissertation also places American history in a broad transatlantic context. The dissertation focuses on the Land League movement in the United States and Ireland in the 1880s and examines the transatlantic nature and influence of Irish-American nationalism. The Land League was an Irish agrarian movement that quickly became the most popular Irish nationalist movement of the nineteenth-century. Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell founded the Land League in Ireland in 1879, against the backdrop of crop failure and agrarian unrest. It soon had branches throughout the Irish diaspora, including Canada, Australia, and Britain as well as the United States. Branches of the Land League were founded across the United States and thousands of Irish Americans participated in branches in their local communities. Unlike studies that focus exclusively on immigrant activities in America, my research demonstrates the continued link of immigrants with their country of origin through the development of a vibrant transatlantic Irish nationalism. My dissertation demonstrates the important contribution of women and the working class in Irish nationalist movements and their impact in shaping Irish ethnic identity in the United States. The dissertation also argues that Irish nationalism was an important element of many American Gilded Age social reform movements such as the Knights of Labor, Catholic colonization, and attempts at agrarian reform. In the late nineteenth century the newly reunited United States struggled to reconstruct itself in a period of dramatic demographic, economic, political, and social change. My work explains the vital and dynamic part played by Irish Americans in this search for a new order; men and women in the Land League were critical actors in efforts to achieve political and social reform in the United States.",288340037,,Dissertations & Theses," Janis, Ely M.JanisM.ElyJanis, Ely M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1555885601 , 40368021 , 66569 , 9780549585893 , 3310161 , 3310161", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549585893, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/288340037?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American studies , American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Ethnic identity , Gender , Gilded Age , Immigrants , Ireland , Irish question , Irish-American , Land League , Nationalism , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Land+League+in+the+United+States+and+Ireland%3A+Nationalism%2C+gender+and+ethnicity+in+the+Gilded+Age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Janis%2C+Ely+M.&amp;isbn=9780549585893&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"161,"Ecological revolution: The political origins of environmental degradation and environmental amelioration; patterns, processes, outcomes; a comparative study of Japan, China, and Europe","Most argue environmental movements are a novel feature of world politics. I argue that they are a durable feature of a degradative political economy. Past or present, environmental politics became expressed in major religious change movements as material oppositions to state environmental degradation using discourses available. An historical pattern is identified in which two powerful intercompeting groups, in efforts to obtain support of each other or to derive benefit from the weaker group, engage in activities that degrade their common environment. One group includes delocalized networks of territorial state-based elites and mechanisms they utilize to consolidate power. They consolidate economic, material, and ideological relations in a territory over time. This leads toward mounting externalities effecting desires to escape in the other group. The other group includes the multiple areas of more geographically embedded peasants/citizens. This group responds in a variety of ecological revolutionary ways to its suffering from state-based environmental degradation. This leads to their more autonomy-inclined ideological and material support frameworks against degradation-encouraging state based elites. Peasant/citizens' mobilizations termed religious or ecological revolutions have several common features often overlooked because analyzing global religious movements often has been carried out in isolation from political economic issues. Analyzing global religious movements previously assumed major religious 'Axial Age' changes in world history (using Karl Jaspers' phrase) have only been an identity issue, some form of nonmaterial irrationality in action (left-wing neo-Marxist views of religious social movements), or some interesting 'epoch' according to Jaspers that happened once and never happened after that. This dissertation argues many major religious movements combined health movements, peasant/citizen ecological (or local jurisdictional) protection movements, and local economic institutional movements toward peasant/citizen autonomy, rolled into one.

The Roma social movement creates these representation structures with reference to their ethnic group identity.  The purpose of these organising structures of representation is to articulate the shared interests of the Romani community which are necessarily suppressed by the utilitarian principles of liberal democratic polities.  However, not all those who claim to represent the interests of the Roma do so legitimately, thus this thesis determines how legitimate these organising structures of representation actually are.  Theoretically this thesis seeks to advance understandings of the complex relationship between ethnic mobilisation, interest articulation, and legitimate representation with regard to minorities, and empirically it details the case of Romani political participation in Hungary and Romania, as well as the transnational political context.",301674926,,Dissertations & Theses," McGarry, A.McGarryA.McGarry, A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761449051 , 45259241 , 101309 , U239447 , U239447", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301674926?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN117129 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Who+speaks+for+the+Roma%3F%22%C2%A0+Political+participation+and+legitimate+representation+in+Hungary+and+Romania.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McGarry%2C+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"163,"An analysis of Bolivia's new framework for social, political and economic regional integration","Bolivia's approach to a post-neoliberal political economy includes reimagining practices of trade and integration. Drawing on indigenous and economic nationalist ideological currents, Bolivian social movements were successful in demonstrating against existing trade agreements and inserting alternative proposals into Bolivian integration policies under the Morales government. These include incorporating principles of cooperation, solidarity, complementarity and national sovereignty into existing trade fora and Bolivia's 2006 TCP-ALBA accord with Venezuela and Cuba. This agreement generated expanded social programs and several development projects, but has not demonstrated significant economic improvements. This thesis argues that Bolivia's new paradigm for integration is limited by endogenous structural, institutional and political impediments. Additionally, the integration strategy proposed by the Morales government risks a new form of dependency, centered on Venezuelan support and high energy rents. However, this study also suggests it is possible to advance a redistributive agenda at the margins in the emergent multi-polar world.

Until recently, the effects of this mismanagement was contained within the country impacting its social, and economic development. However now, with research showing global climate change, the effects have a global impact due to the scale of carbon emissions produced in Indonesia and the subsequent contribution to greenhouse gases. Analysts and observers agree that Indonesia has past a point of no return regarding rehabilitation of most of its national forest cover, while pollution from mining and over-fishing is taking its toll locally, to the extent that social and political upheaval is certainly a possibility in the medium- to long-term as communities suffer a loss of livelihoods and opportunity. The Indonesian public and policy makers are aware of their predicament and this consciousness is being converted into legislation both nationally and regionally. However, corruption and the lack of a clear demarcation between central and regional responsibilities allows the degradation and destruction to continue and even accelerate. The recent increase in demand for palm oil (used as a bio-fuel particularly in Europe), further complicates the situation, as this has now become a new incentive to continue the felling of swathes of forest (legally and illegally), and the draining of boglands. This paper tracks natural resource management and extraction over the past sixty years in Indonesia by taking an approach that highlights degradation of the environment through political evolution and development models. It juxtaposes political developments (from the autocratic and corrupt regime of President Soeharto, through to the Asian financial crisis of 1998 and the beginning of democracy under the reformasi movement), against development economics theory and practice - traditional Washington Consensus policies including the involvement of the International Monetary Fund, as well as a more sustainable approach to development that incorporates multi-tiered approaches including social and environmental inputs. It highlights the paradox of accelerated ecological destruction during the recently reformed decentralized democracy, compared to the relatively controlled extraction under dictatorship, and discusses approaches for environmental sustainability, including environmental accounting, for the present and future.",304329841,,Dissertations & Theses," McClellan, IanMcClellanIanMcClellan, Ian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1481675011 , 39239581 , 66569 , 9780549482475 , 1452305 , 1452305", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549482475, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304329841?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science"," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science"," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science",," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science"," History , Political science , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indonesia%27s+natural+resources+and+the+environment%3A+Development%2C+politics%2C+and+ecological+destruction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McClellan%2C+Ian&amp;isbn=9780549482475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"165,"Gendering marriage migration and fragmented citizenship formation: “Korean” wives, daughters-in-law, and mothers from the Philippines","This dissertation research examines the ways in which Filipina migrants who travel to marry South Korean farmers become part of the transnational migration stream, and explore how this movement reinforces and challenges gender relations in the local-global dimension.

By incorporating previous marriage migration theories based on the global political economy with feminist theories on patriarchal ideologies and systems, reproductive labor, and citizenship, this study contributes to explaining how gender roles play a significant role in Filipinas' and Korean men's decisions to be engaged in cross-border marriages and how Filipinas' reproductive labor is important in accounting for their membership in their new families, communities and the state. Furthermore, it argues that Filipinas' status as mothers is critical in their formation of Korean citizenship, which, however, is fragmented due to their class and racial status as well as the global standing of their country of origin in international hierarchies.",304351676,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, MinjeongKimMinjeongKim, Minjeong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1601761031 , 40858061 , 66569 , 9780549799566 , 3327489 , 3327489", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549799566, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304351676?accountid=14496," 0628 Individual & family studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0628 Individual & family studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0628 Individual & family studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0628 Individual & family studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Individual & family studies , Ethnic studies , Gender studies , Citizenship , Daughters , Philippines"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Immigration (Filipino/as) , Korea , Marriage migration , Motherhood , Philippines , Reproductive labor , South Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendering+marriage+migration+and+fragmented+citizenship+formation%3A+%E2%80%9CKorean%E2%80%9D+wives%2C+daughters-in-law%2C+and+mothers+from+the+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Minjeong&amp;isbn=9780549799566&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"166,Between bureaucracy and social movements: Careers in the Justice for Janitors,"Industrial relations scholars and organizational sociologists have long argued that American trade unions adopted bureaucratic structures and practices in order to survive in the economic and political environment of the United States. Scholars drew a sharp dichotomy between bureaucratic unionism, which they viewed as the dominant institutional form of American unions, and social movement unionism. But more recently, scholars have argued that the environment has shifted, leading American unions to move away from traditional policies and practices toward social movement unionism. This research examines the organizational change process and current practices of the largest and most successful of such unions, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). The dissertation starts with a puzzle: while the union is ideologically progressive and strategically innovative, it is also extremely centralized and bureaucratic; furthermore, bureaucratization and centralization have both increased during the period in which the union adopted social movement elements in its practice. Earlier theories on institutional change in the labor movement have not adequately captured the dynamic coexistence of opposing elements. This study develops a theory of institutional change based on the political process. The thesis introduces the concept of movement careers and identifies these careers as a mechanism that mitigates the tension between bureaucracy and idealism in the union. Part I of the thesis examines historical change in the union during the period 1950s - mid-1990s. It shows that the adoption of social movement elements by the union was the product of a contentious political process. Political battles and the urgency of reform felt by ideologically progressive staff further centralized control in the national union. These findings contrast with previous research that has depicted institutional change in the labor movement as rational organizational responses to environmental change. Part II introduces and develops the concept of movement careers. It defines these careers as careers motivated by ongoing personal transformations triggered by an initial politicizing experience. It identifies the structural and ideological features that set movement careers apart from conventional organizational careers. Movement career builders think of their work in the union primarily in terms of changing the existing social order. Thus, they choose not to ascend the hierarchy of the organization. Part III uses observational data from four local sites of the union and shows that sustaining idealism in a bureaucratic structure has posed a dilemma in three out of the four sites. This part of the thesis develops a theory of the organizational and environmental contexts that can foster movement careers in formal organizations.

The globalizing of the U.S. women’s movement is the result of participation in a broad and global cycle of political protest that brought together disparate streams of women’s organizing in the U.S. (as well as non-gender specific organizing) around a shared set of objectives and frames. The resulting collaborative process provided the opportunity for frame transformation and repertoire adaptation to meet the changing political opportunity structure and cooperate with disparate social movement organizations. This project is concerned with changes within and across movements overall. In order to examine entire movements, this dissertation utilizes a mixed methods approach to combine individual level, organization and coalition level data. The dissertation chapters progress from individual level to movement level analysis; employing both qualitative and quantitative methods at each level. This dissertation focuses on key women’s peace and women’s rights organizations to examine differences in frame preference, repertoires and agendas between the two groups of organizations. This project argues that the differences that do remain complement one another so that one group of organizations more successfully draws individuals into the movement while the second set maintains involvement over the long-term. This dissertation concludes with an application of these overall trends to theorize about the implications for women’s organizing in the long-term.",304357813,,Dissertations & Theses," Kutz-Flamenbaum, RachelKutz-FlamenbaumRachelKutz-Flamenbaum, Rachel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1637577321 , 41725761 , 66569 , 9780549924326 , 3338222 , 3338222", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549924326, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304357813?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," American studies , Womens studies , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Antiwar movement , Protest cycles , Social movements , United States , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cycles+of+protest%3A+Impact+of+the+contemporary+anti-war+movement+on+the+U.S.+women%27s+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kutz-Flamenbaum%2C+Rachel&amp;isbn=9780549924326&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"168,"What factors determine the success of transnational redress?: Political leaders, redress movements, regime type, international human rights regimes or economic relationship","How do people come to terms with past historical injustices between countries? This is a deep-rooted question among previously hostile countries. Focusing on the more practical facet, what factors determine the success of transnational redress of past historical injustice? The existing literature emphasized the importance of the role of political leaders and international human rights laws in a target country, and social movement strategy in an addressee country. Yet, there are many cases that existing theories do not answer appropriately. For example, why does a target country willingly make amends for one case of historical injustice, but not for another case? In addition, existing research lacks systematic analysis, calling into question the applicability of theories. Consequently, this dissertation has two major research goals: proposing new theories and testing the empirical validity of both existing ones as well as new ones. I propose two domestic factors in an addressee country and one dyadic factor between an addressee and target country: (i) adoption of international human right regimes and (ii) democracy in an addressee country, and (iii) economic dependence of an addressee on target country. This dissertation examines transnational redress systematically, using one original data set with two original variables which I have created for 1945 to 2000. I collected 22 transnational redress cases, many of which are obscure in the existing literature. My new data sets include the government acceptance level of nine target countries and the level of reparations claims in twenty addressee countries.

As a step towards studying this phenomenon in-depth, research entitled ""An Assessment of Seechewal Initiative in the State of Punjab, India: An example of Community-based-conservation?, was undertaken by me and examined in terms of a community-based conservation initiative. The main objectives of this research were to describe and understand the Seechewal initiative and to determine its participatory nature. The research also assessed the initiative in terms of environmental, economic and social dimensions, and examined the opportunity of extending the positive impacts of this initiative to other areas in Punjab. Further methods for scaling-up this initiative by other communities were also examined. The study concluded that a renewed focus on the management and conservation of natural resources by communities is emerging. Communities are being empowered directly or indirectly to manage their surroundings. The process could be self-initiated by the community or triggered by government, an NGO; or any other agency. The Seechewal movement is a religious and environmental movement with origins in the district of Jalandhar in the state of Punjab and it has spread to adjoining villages. The movement has multi-faceted components ranging from the construction of roads, laying of sewerage systems, provision of a water supply and cleaning the river Kali Rein. The environmental, economic and social impacts of the Seechewal initiative are visible, as they have not only helped improve the living conditions of the residents but also their general quality of life. In addition it has influenced on the social structure of the community, with community united into one whole unit where people are motivated, working together for one cause and overcoming their differences in terms of caste, creed, and economic status. Agriculture, being the backbone of the economy in the area, has benefited greatly due to an increase in the normal flow of the Kali Rein. The river is flowing effectively after it was cleaned up with the help of community efforts. The scaling-up of this initiative is demonstrated by having the principles, technologies and the processes that were first tested in village Seechewal, adopted elsewhere in the region. The Seechewal initiative has been mentioned in both local and international press and by the former president of India. Dr. A.P.J.

Blackstone (1841–1935),"The dissertation is a study of William E. Blackstone's contributions to the emerging evangelical fundamentalist movement in America. Though virtually unrecognized by the scholarly community, Blackstone wrote the most popular book on premillennialism during his day, and his commitment to dispensational premillennialism also drove him to be a leading figure in political Zionism and missionary work. The historiography of the fundamentalist movement suffers because of its neglect of the work of Blackstone. Chapter one examines the seminal studies in Blackstone's historiography as well as a review of his life. Chapter two shows the involvement of Blackstone in the premillennial movement. His involvement with the Bible conference movement in America led to his relationships with the most influential premillennialists of the time. The need for premillennial literature drove Blackstone to write his popular volume, Jesus Is Coming , where he outlined his views on hermeneutics, Israel and the Church, the Rapture, the Tribulation, the Millennium, the chronology of the end-times, and the practical nature of the doctrine. Chapter three deals with Blackstone's involvement with Zionism, as produced by his premillennialism. He initiated the Conference on the Past, Present and Future of Israel, but was dissatisfied with the limited results. Consequently, he penned the Blackstone Memorial that he presented to President Benjamin Harrison in 1891. The Memorial became a foundational document in the history of Zionism in America. Also as a result of his Zionism, Blackstone became the Honorary Commissioner for the World's Columbian Exposition for international arbitration among warring nations. In Blackstone's mind, this Arbitration Memorial functioned to protect the Jewish people upon their arrival in Palestine. Chapter four shows that Blackstone's zeal for missionary work was spawned by his dispensational premillennial beliefs. He was one of the most prolific speakers on missionary work during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He founded the CHM in Chicago, which had a variety of religious and social ministries. The mission also published The Jewish Era: A Christian Quarterly , which was a commentary on the emerging evangelical fundamentalist movement in the field of Jewish missions. Blackstone was also involved in the founding of the Christian and Missionary Alliance; Moody Bible Institute; the Chicago Training School for City, Home, and Foreign Missions; and the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. Blackstone also spent five years in China, and served as the Trustee of the Milton Stewart Evangelistic Fund.",304408863,,Dissertations & Theses," Moorhead, Jonathan DavidMoorheadDavidJonathanMoorhead, Jonathan David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1562964981 , 40487721 , 66569 , 9780549686262 , 3318932 , 3318932", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549686262, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304408863?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0527 Religious education"," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0527 Religious education"," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0527 Religious education",," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0527 Religious education"," Biographies , Religious history , American history , Religious education"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Education , Blackstone, William E. , Chicago Hebrew Mission , Fundamentalism , Jewish studies , Missionaries , Missionary , Premillennialism , Zionism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jesus+is+coming%3A+The+life+and+work+of+William+E.+Blackstone+%281841%E2%80%931935%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moorhead%2C+Jonathan+David&amp;isbn=9780549686262&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"172,Political repression and capitalist globalization: A theory of a Transnational Repressive Apparatus,"This dissertation argues that a central aspect of transnational capitalism in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the rise of a Transnational Repressive Apparatus (TRA) that limited the emergence of broad based and effective opposition movements in the global North. An application of Marxist state theory at the transnational level is made to theorize the TRA. The concept of the TRA builds upon the work of Robinson (2004) who argued that a Transnational Capitalist Class (TCC) has benefited from the emergence of a Transnational State (TNS) apparatus since the 1970s. Specifically, the concept of the TRA builds upon the notions of State Repressive Apparatus and Ideological Repressive Apparatus described by Althusser (1971) as well as the concepts of consensus and coercion offered by Gramsci (1971), and applies them to the transnational level. The TRA theorized here is made up of ideological, economic, legal, and policing/security pillars. The ideological and economic pillars serve to limit peoples' conceptions about the global political economy so that they accept the social relations of capitalism as natural. The force of the legal and policing/security pillars of the TRA greet those who pass through the first two pillars of the TRA into open opposition to transnational capitalism. Cosmopolitan theory, it is argued, in embracing global social democracy, fails to account for the repressive nature of cosmopolitan institutions and practices as exemplified in this account of the TRA. A Marxist view on the global political economy, which stresses the centrality of imperialism and primitive accumulation as TCC policy imperatives, allows for insight into the nature of capitalism and the requirement that political repression is a necessary feature of transnational capitalism in the current era. The Marxist view allows for an account of the TRA.",304411640,,Dissertations & Theses," Vaughn, Paul AnthonyVaughnAnthonyPaulVaughn, Paul Anthony",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1859936881 , 48536181 , 66569 , 9781109318258 , 3370648 , 3370648", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109318258, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304411640?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure",," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," International law , Social structure , Capitalism , Globalization , Politics"," Social sciences , Althusser, Louis , Capitalism , Capitalist class , Globalization , Marxism , Marxist theory , Political repression , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+repression+and+capitalist+globalization%3A+A+theory+of+a+Transnational+Repressive+Apparatus&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vaughn%2C+Paul+Anthony&amp;isbn=9781109318258&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"173,Social movements for foreign workers in South Korea: A perspective on the state for transnational social movements,"Since the mid 1990s, the movements for foreign workers have been successfully developed in Korea, and could accomplish their primary goal to introduce a more lawful and internationally accepted system instead of the expedient system for the supply of foreign labor force, while the similar movements in Japan, which has experienced similar problems and managed similar system, could not gain successful results. How can we explain this difference? I argue that the key here is the existence of the Korean Christian groups, which have led these movements. Compared with Japanese counterpart, they succeeded to organize transnational coalitions based on their experiences and influence from the past pro-democracy movements and to create transnational framing by appealing to the past experience of Korea as a migrants sending country and the transnational spirit of Christianity. Above all, the Korean activists succeeded to take advantage of political opportunities provided by the progressive regime change, so that they could form coalitions with some favorable governmental branches as well as transnational actors. On the contrary, the Japanese movements were not able to organize transnational mobilization and to create effective ideology due to the lack of powerful actors in conjunction with the existence of the conservative and collective political culture and systems. In this global age, the demands of economic globalization or the pressures of transnational political institutions play important roles in the processes of domestic politics and policy decision. Thus, many recent transnational social movements and related studies have focused on those transnational forces, while often disregarded the important role of the state. However, those demands or pressures do not produce the same results in every country. This is why the propensity and the role of the state, which provide critical political opportunities, are still important for transnational social movements. Especially, I focus on the characteristic of the state as a disaggregated mediator through which various social forces are mediated, and argue this characteristic is still critical for transnational social movements as well as domestic movements.",304415778,,Dissertations & Theses," Choi, JaehoonChoiJaehoonChoi, Jaehoon",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1580935601 , 40797291 , 66569 , 9780549739982 , 3322571 , 3322571", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549739982, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304415778?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," Labor relations , Social structure , Social research , Foreign labor , Workers , South Korea"," Social sciences , Foreign workers , Globalization , Korea , Social movements , South Korea , State",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+movements+for+foreign+workers+in+South+Korea%3A+A+perspective+on+the+state+for+transnational+social+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Choi%2C+Jaehoon&amp;isbn=9780549739982&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"174,"Anthem: Music and politics in diaspora, 1920–1970s","Anthem: Music and Politics in Diaspora, 1920–1970s examines songs that have influenced the political and popular consciousness of the African diaspora and their use as political tools in movement cultures. Each chapter offers an historical reading of a song and its utility within Black political mobilizations. Through an analysis of these songs as anthems, the project addresses their heightened function as art texts that performed the cultural work of constructing diasporic identity within U.S. and international contexts. Combining elements of social, cultural, and political history, music and cultural theory, and social movement theory, this work situates culture at the center of Black diasporic resistance. I argue that music has been and continues to be central to the way the diaspora articulates itself and its politics, particularly through its use by Black organizations and individual political actors. I additionally highlight music as a political bridge between cultures as I look at the use of these anthems in other nations and/or cultural contexts. The anthems become the point of departure for this analysis through their duality as a group of musical components and a set of organizing strategies in Black social movements. Racial uplift, labor solidarity, and the transition from integration to Black Power during the Civil Rights Movement are ideas and practices discussed within diaspora through songs such as ""Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing"" and ""To Be Young, Gifted and Black."" Anthem documents how these songs engage this critical communal discourse and encourage its growth and translation into action. This vivid reexamination of Black music interrogates the political dimension of cultural production while maintaining a focus on methods of resistance and organizing traditions within communities of color. The project contributes to the literature which posits a long civil rights movement and adds to a body of scholarship which documents the convergence of Black popular culture and Black internationalism in the twentieth century.",304424198,,Dissertations & Theses," Redmond, Shana L.RedmondL.ShanaRedmond, Shana L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1550369801 , 40150481 , 66569 , 9780549656500 , 3317206 , 3317206", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549656500, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304424198?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history"," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history"," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history",," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history"," American studies , African Americans , Black history"," Social sciences , African diaspora , Black music , Black popular culture , Civil Rights movement , Civil rights movement , Diaspora , Music , Politics , Social movements , Transnational culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Anthem%3A+Music+and+politics+in+diaspora%2C+1920%E2%80%931970s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Redmond%2C+Shana+L.&amp;isbn=9780549656500&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"175,"Zapaturismo in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Mexico: Marketplace capitalism meets revolutionary tourism","The EZLN (Ejército Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional) resistance in Chiapas, Mexico remade the image of San Cristóbal from a quaint tourist destination to a location of adventure and social revolution.

One of the most notable contributions has been the stimulation of an overwhelming rise in international solidarity actors to the area. These factors along with a proximity to popular Maya archaeological sites, a high population of Indigenous Maya, and pivotal Spanish history reflected in colonial architecture, combine to lure international tourists to the area.

However often the organic ties between locally based intellectuals and the peasant organizations are severed and result in a change in representative discourse from one of representation to one of paternalism. The effect is a new class dynamic between the peasantry and the urban professional class from which these intellectuals are drawn. In order to comprehend the change in class ties and between intellectuals and peasant organizations it is necessary to understand the influence exerted by international non governmental organizations (NGOs) on local governments and social movements and how peasant organizations serve to justify the NGOs mission statement and financial support. To achieve this we must pay close attention to the system by which international aid organizations communicate and work with local level peasant associations through the mediation of local level intellectuals and professional supporters. This research, adopting a Gramscian theoretical approach, provides an ethnographic analysis of peasant associations in rural Haiti and their collaborative and conflicting relationships with agronomist-intellectuals and the NGOs for whom these intellectuals work. Based on nine months intensive ethnographic study in rural southwest Haiti, this research concludes that localized intellectuals, as intermediaries between northern development organizations and southern grassroots associations, act as carriers of a northern hegemonic development discourse that seeks to position these associations as organizations of civil society that support free market principles and mechanisms. As peasant associations adopt this discourse through participation in the benefits of economic development practice, there develops contradictions in the political self-consciousness of these associations. Though this contradictory consciousness allows the peasantry to organize for the betterment of their communities, it prevents the development of a political consciousness by preventing these associations from involvement in political processes or political action. The broader implication of these conclusions is a reconsideration of the perceived relationship between civil society and political society by development agencies as they work among southern populations around the world.",304445170,,Dissertations & Theses," Vannier, Christian N.VannierN.ChristianVannier, Christian N.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472134401 , 39055821 , 66569 , 9780549450825 , 3300459 , 3300459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549450825, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304445170?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Agronomists , Caribbean , Development , Haiti , Intellectuals , NGOs , Nongovernmental organizations , Peasants",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+know+the+field+better%3A+Peasant+associations%2C+NGOs%2C+and+agronomists+in+rural+Haitian+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vannier%2C+Christian+N.&amp;isbn=9780549450825&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"177,"Mobilizing movements, mobilizing contemporary Islamic resistance","Recent world events, ranging from international violence to elections, have propelled academics and policymakers to examine Islamic resistance movements more closely.

I will demonstrate that architecture, specifically Spectacular Architecture, 1 has emerged as a visible materialization of this new phase of global capitalism serving as a symbol of a city's cultural and infrastructural capital in the international market. Spectacular Architecture has become a new urban strategy by which to assert a city's prestige and reputation in order to attract capital investments in a highly competitive context. As the study case of Bilbao shows, Spectacular Architecture plays an important role in forming urban and social identity, in renovating a city's economic vitality, and in developing the growing global service industry related to tourism. Spectacular buildings serve as symbols to identify a city as a prosperous new place to visit and consume. Through Spectacular Architecture and real estate speculation, cities transform entire neighborhoods into backdrops where an opulent lifestyle is conceived as the only possible. I will analyze the Spectacular Architecture process, the practicing architects, the expansion of this movement as related to global capital and markets as well as provide detailed case study on the Guggenheim Museum completed in Bilbao in 1997 (see Appendix figure 1). 1 Term coined by Juan Manuel Holgado in the present paper referring to an architectural style or movement based on striking and unconventional forms and colors that make buildings appear as an urban icon.",304458207,,Dissertations & Theses," Holgado, Juan ManuelHolgadoManuelJuanHolgado, Juan Manuel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1614597671 , 41387571 , 66569 , 9780549878018 , 1459596 , 1459596", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549878018, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304458207?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning",," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," Architecture , Urban planning"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spectacular+architecture+as+the+postmodern+urban+model+in+the+era+of+late+capitalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holgado%2C+Juan+Manuel&amp;isbn=9780549878018&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"179,"Chican(a) artists and Zapatistas walk together asking, listening, learning: The role of transnational informal learning networks in the creation of a better world","In an era of globalized capital, informal learning is particularly important to emancipatory struggles. This qualitative study examines the informal learning relationship between the Zapatistas and 9 Chican@ artists from Los Angeles, California. The Chican@ artists are inspired to learn with and from the insurgent Zapatistas’ experiences and messages as they too attempt to liberate themselves from what they consider institutional oppression in the U.S. Much of the initial learning examined revolves around the Encuentro Chican@-Zapatista of August 1997. The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of the role of transnational emancipatory informal network learning in an era of globalization. To explore the informal learning process it was important to ask the guiding questions: Why, how, and what did the Chican@ artists learn from their contact and interaction with the Zapatista rebels of Chiapas Mexico and what impact did it have and are they having on the Chican@ Movement? The study shows that the 9 Chican@ artists were initially attracted to Zapatismo because of centrifugal negative experiences in the U.S. as they encounter institutional racism, social marginalization and exclusion from the social justice movements on the one hand, and positive centripetal identities and relationships that draw them towards Zapatismo, on the other. The Chican@ artists are critical of the traditional social justice organizations’ strategic aims to either reform capitalism or to take state power. The study shows that the Chican@ artists related to the Zapatistas through a centripetal positive learning process that include ethnic cultural, spiritual and political affinities. This research demonstrates that the informal learning relationship between Zapatistas and Chican@s is inter-subjective or horizontal because the learning style is between persons that value their differentness. While this study agrees with Peter Mayo’s and Greg Foley’s research on transformative learning, it is implicitly critical of Paulo Freire’s approach given that the Freirean facilitator or change agent’s role evokes a directive rather than a horizontal method. This research implies that the artists’ echoing of the Zapatista message reinforced and enhanced the initial Zapatista call and have facilitated the initiation of a transformational paradigmatic shift within the Chican@ movement.",304461577,,Dissertations & Theses," Flores, Roberto GonzalezFloresGonzalezRobertoFlores, Roberto Gonzalez",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1810677991 , 40368261 , 66569 , 9780549786733 , 3325161 , 3325161", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549786733, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304461577?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Educational sociology , Hispanic American studies , Social change , Globalization"," Social sciences , Education , Artists , Chican@ , Informal learning , Transnational , Zapatistas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Chican%28a%29+artists+and+Zapatistas+walk+together+asking%2C+listening%2C+learning%3A+The+role+of+transnational+informal+learning+networks+in+the+creation+of+a+better+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Flores%2C+Roberto+Gonzalez&amp;isbn=9780549786733&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"180,"Disrupting boundaries of desire: Gender, sexuality, and globalization in Tsai Ming -liang's cinema of the oppressed","This dissertation explores the representation of gender, sexuality, and globalization in Tsai Ming-liang's films. Not only does it provide a close reading of Tsai's eight feature-length films, but it also situates his films in the context of Taiwan New Cinema as well as the rise of tongzhi (gay and lesbian) movement in Taiwan. In contrast to the films made by other Taiwan New Cinema directors, Tsai's films conjure up a unique minimalist and diasporic aesthetic that draws scrupulous attention to the critical aspects of gender, sexuality, and transnational cultural flows in Taiwan and abroad. Nevertheless, his films do not portray (homo) sexuality as innate and natural, nor do they embrace the kind of visibility and identity politics that the mainstream tongzhi movement advocates. Instead, his films illustrate how genders and sexualities are multiple, changeable, performative, and interconnected with a wide range of other social identities and power relations. The introduction begins with a brief literature review of feminist and queer discourses, and then provides a general overview of Taiwan New Cinema and Taiwan's tongzhi movement. It investigates the intertwined relationships between Tsai's Malaysian-Chinese background, his ambiguous sexuality, his success in the international film circuit, and the major characteristics of his eight feature films. Chapter One looks into Tsai's first two features, Rebels of the Neon God (1992) and Vive L'Amour (1994) to rethink the advance of gendered globalization in enhancing the individual's sexual mobility and unshackling the grip of the traditional family. Chapter Two offers a queer reading of The River (1997) and Goodbye Dragon Inn (2003) to visualize the invisible heteronormativity in Taiwanese society. Chapter Three examines how Tsai uses the paradigm of upstairs and downstairs and the seven-hour difference between Paris and Taipei to allegorize and undo gender hierarchy in The Hole (1998) and What Time Is It There? (2001). Chapter Four investigates the ways in which the figure of the stranger is used to envision a shared marginality in The Wayward Cloud (2005) and I Don't Want to Sleep Alone (2006). The conclusion would further conceptualize the disruptive and empowering implications of strangers in Tsai's films.",304473547,,Dissertations & Theses," Chang, Kai-manChangKai-manChang, Kai-man",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1674956191 , 40512451 , 66569 , 9781109003475 , 3344300 , 3344300", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109003475, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304473547?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies",," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies"," Asian literature , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , China , Gender , Globalization , Queer , Sexuality , Taiwan New Cinema , Tsai, Ming-liang",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Disrupting+boundaries+of+desire%3A+Gender%2C+sexuality%2C+and+globalization+in+Tsai+Ming+-liang%27s+cinema+of+the+oppressed&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chang%2C+Kai-man&amp;isbn=9781109003475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"181,Landcare in Australia: Is it an effective means of achieving sustainable land management?,"The twentieth century has forced Australians to finally recognize the disastrous effects that various forms of land degradation are having on their country's soil and environment. Two centuries of poor government policies based on conflicting support for both local initiatives trying to halt land degradation and international goals of trying to compete within a competitive global market economy drove Australians to focus on management practices that maximized short-term production with little regard for, or understanding of the damage being done to the biophysical make-up of the land. As global support for the concept of sustainable development grew throughout the 1980s, the concept of Landcare was established in Australia. Landcare was conceived as a bottom-up, grassroots movement dedicated to developing social cohesion among individual farmers, landholders and individuals, all of whom had a common concern for the environment. Landcare's objective was to help create sustainable land management initiatives that would be based on both government policy and public support. Has Landcare's objective been achieved, or has it yielded to the forces of economics and misunderstanding? Landcare's importance in creating awareness and providing education and training about land degradation and how to combat its resulting effects has been very effective. Its ability to move beyond simply being an information movement has yet to be decided.

Consequently, although situated squarely within the context of the Chicano Movement, this project necessarily examines the musical yet political links between Chicano musicians and their counterparts in the American labor movement, Civil Rights Movement, and Latin American social movements of the period. Coupled with the mobilization of their own Mexican musical and cultural traditions, Chicano musicians engaged these other repertoires of struggle to form the nexus of Chicana/o musical expression during the Movement. By viewing Chicana/o music within this broader lens, my research demonstrates that the complexities of the movimiento and Chicana/o political struggle cannot be adequately understood without thinking about how Chicano cultural producers engage a diversity of other race, ethnic, and regional struggles. Rather than assume a homologous relationship between music and identity, my research historicizes musical practices in the context of their struggle for political, social, and cultural rights and resources and the strategies employed by diverse communities working together to overcome the failures of governmental and institutional programs. The creative dialogues and musical exchanges that occurred among Chicano musicians suggest not only forms of ethnic solidarity but also the culturally ""hybrid"" expressions that shape even nationalist movements. Key to this approach is recognizing the simultaneously global and local character of Chicana/o musical production, where the flows of transnationalism circulated not only ideas, peoples, and sounds, but also political struggles. This project thus raises a number of critical questions about Chicano Movement music and its political import. Ultimately, I suggest that it was the ability to perform authoritatively within the bi-cultural and increasingly transnational space of the Chicano experience that empowered movimiento music to express the feelings of autonomy engendered by the Movement.",304482559,,Dissertations & Theses," Azcona, Stevan CesarAzconaCesarStevanAzcona, Stevan Cesar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594497791 , 40512841 , 66569 , 9780549738862 , 3320607 , 3320607", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549738862, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304482559?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0737 Hispanic Americans",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," Cultural anthropology , Folklore , Music , Hispanic Americans"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Aztlan , Chicano Movement , Culture , Latin America , Protest songs , Social movements , UFW",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Movements+in+Chicano+music%3A+Performing+culture%2C+performing+politics%2C+1965%E2%80%931979&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Azcona%2C+Stevan+Cesar&amp;isbn=9780549738862&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"183,Transnational feminisms in translation: The making of a women's anti -domestic violence movement in China,"My dissertation examines the construction of the contemporary Chinese women's movement against domestic violence. It explores the anti-DV campaign in China within the global context of women's transnational human rights campaigns against gender violence and historical factors (local and global) associated with the origin and work of the Network/Research Center for Combating Domestic Violence (the DVN), a new women's non-governmental organization in Beijing with an unprecedented and exclusive commitment to the fight against domestic violence in China. Specifically, my analysis interrogates the DVN as a global-local interface for women's rights that usually emphasizes initiatives at the global level and their “impact” on women's organizing at the local level. My case study finds that transnational feminist advocacy activism, which has made violence against women an international policy issue through application of a human rights framework, provides crucial political opportunities and economic resources for women's local political organizing. For anti-DV activism in the civil society sector of China, the processes of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 and the international donors who fund Chinese women's NGOs are particularly important. However, Chinese woman have not bee passive followers of their Western sisters, nor is violence against women an imposed agenda or imported ideology. In fact, for DVN activists, mobilizing against domestic violence and establishing a specialized NGO to address this issue went beyond the goal of combating domestic violence. To raise social awareness and promote institutional action, the DVN focuses on inculcating gender and human rights perspectives in local agencies and adopts an “engaging” approach to the state through the official women's organization, a strategic process shaped by local relations of power. In sum, my dissertation argues that local women's activism forms a critical—though under-studied and under-recognized—site through which a global feminist cause (in this case VAW as a human rights violation) is advanced in locally appropriate ways that feed back into the cause's increasing importance on the global agenda. Evidence comes primarily from archival research, observations and interviews with DVN activists.",304505447,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, LuZhangLuZhang, Lu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1906351111 , 39375661 , 66569 , 9781109394573 , 3375380 , 3375380", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109394573, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304505447?accountid=14496, 0453 Womens studies, 0453 Womens studies, 0453 Womens studies,, 0453 Womens studies," Womens studies , Feminism , Domestic violence , China"," Social sciences , China , Chinese feminism , Domestic violence , Global feminisms , Global-local nexus , Violence against women , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+feminisms+in+translation%3A+The+making+of+a+women%27s%0Aanti+-domestic+violence+movement+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Lu&amp;isbn=9781109394573&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"184,Women and gender in the Maoist People's War in Nepal: Militarism and dislocation,"This dissertation explores changing gender dynamics during crisis and armed conflict to see how global/transnational movements of people, labor, and capital impact the appropriation and production of gender at the local level. The decade long (1996-2006) ""People's War"" in Nepal produced three key processes—militarization, displacement, and altered embodiments of gender—that impacted Nepali women and society. Through a study of women's position in Nepali political and cultural history and multi-sited ethnographic research on the People's War, the dissertation examines how crisis induced displacement and violence impacted and shaped gender dynamics at the local level and Nepali people's mobility at the transnational/global level. The latter has enabled the concept of a ""Nepali diaspora"" to be more visible and political, which is a strategy of survival appropriated by the globally dispersed Nepalis as their homeland reels under crisis and violence and as Nepalis continue to leave for work as migrant laborers. A close look at women's participation in the Maoist war and their representation by the Maoists as well as the state military brings new insights into women's agency through the embodiment of militancy and militarism. Yet, the ""call to arms"" for women in Nepal raises important questions for the feminist politics of representation vis a vis other movements around the globe for peace and social justice. Taking a feminist interdisciplinary perspective, the dissertation explores the ways in which the bio-politics of body, gender, and sexuality are enmeshed with nationalism, ideology and economics and work in the production of the ""migrant woman"" and the ""revolutionary woman"" in contemporary times of transnationalism and globalization.",304511044,,Dissertations & Theses," Lohani-Chase, Rama S.Lohani-ChaseS.RamaLohani-Chase, Rama S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1642921371 , 41442911 , 66569 , 9780549890287 , 3335542 , 3335542", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549890287, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304511044?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Diaspora , Dislocation , Gender , Gender in South Asia , Maoist , Militarization , Nepal , Nepali diaspora , Nepali women , People's War in Nepal , War , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+and+gender+in+the+Maoist+People%27s+War+in+Nepal%3A+Militarism+and+dislocation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lohani-Chase%2C+Rama+S.&amp;isbn=9780549890287&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"185,Women on the move: A history of Indian nurse migration to the United States,"My dissertation historicizes Indian nurse migration to the United States. I argue that this movement cannot be understood outside of the history of US-based medical interests migrating to India. This begins with the movement of US-based single female medical missionaries and nurses to colonial India. Missionaries were central to establishing biomedical nursing on the subcontinent, and training the first Indians as nurses. They also laid the institutional and ideological groundwork for the later intervention of the Rockefeller Foundation between the World Wars. Rockefeller rewrote the map of global medical migration, placing the US firmly at its center. It also modeled the international fellowships that drew the first generation of post-independence Indian nursing leaders to study in the US. These early migrants nurtured transnational social networks linking Indian nurses to US hospitals, universities and recruiting agencies. These channels fed into the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act to enable the full-scale immigration of Indian nurses to the US. If global colonial circuits structured the routes of immigration to the US, they also positioned Indian nurses within hierarchies structured through race, religion, class, caste, gender, sexuality and nation. First, the professionalization of colonial nurses came at the expense of their Indian subordinates. Once Indian nurses entered the US, they confronted a market segmented by gender, as well as stratified by race, class and now citizenship status. This limited their mobility, and often contained their labor within its least desirable sectors. Second, the historical stigmatization of nursing has had a longer lasting imprint on Indian nurses than their white American counterparts. In India, the ""polluting"" nature of nursing tasks combined with caste strictures to brand nurses as ""loose"" women performing ""dirty"" work. In the US, the female dominance characterizing nurse immigration created the context for the stigmatization of nurse families by their immigrant cohort and US legislators. This takes shape within the history of exclusion and restriction targeting Asian settlement in the US. It thus links processes of US social formation, migration, professionalization and Anglo-American imperialisms.",304526892,,Dissertations & Theses," Reddy, SujaniReddySujaniReddy, Sujani",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1605134281 , 41049351 , 66569 , 9780549823025 , 3330167 , 3330167", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549823025, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304526892?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0569 Nursing , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0569 Nursing , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0569 Nursing , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0569 Nursing , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , Nursing , Ethnic studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , India , Migration , Nurses , Racial formation , United States , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+on+the+move%3A+A+history+of+Indian+nurse+migration+to+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reddy%2C+Sujani&amp;isbn=9780549823025&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"186,Women of the New Right in Canada,"This study examines right-wing women in Canada by providing a portrait of the largest, national right-wing women's social movement organization, REAL Women of Canada. REAL Women is a Judeo-Christian, pro-family, anti-abortion organization and a key player in the Canadian New Right movement. They are a reactionary countermovement, reacting to the combined effects of feminism or women's expanding public sphere opportunities and capitalism or the collapse of the family wage system. REAL Women's mandate and functions stem from their desire to curtail the tide of change in family life as a result of these forces. Research for this study was collected over two years and includes fieldwork at REAL Women events, interviews with seventeen members, and textual analysis of organizational documents. This dissertation contributes to the growing literature on right-wing women by providing a Canadian case study, cross-national comparisons of right-wing women in Canada and the U.S., and an exploration of REAL Women's global and transnational activities. The findings include that REAL Women is not the grassroots movement it purports to be. Rather, it is an organization of leaders currently facing a sustainability crisis in light of a dwindling local chapter structure, aging membership, and challenges shared by the Canadian New Right from a fragmented infrastructure and waning popular support. Second, REAL Women and their U.S. counterpart, Concerned Women for America share a common family values agenda as expressed through their mobilization appeals and activism. The differences between them — levels of religion, patriotism, and government-based policy preferences — reflect different national political and cultural values and approaches to politics and policy. Third, motherhood is a central activist identity among REAL Women members and a maternal perspective (or making claims as/on behalf of mothers), in addition to a woman's perspective (or making claims as/on behalf of women), is embedded in their policy preferences.

Accordingly, the spheres of the economy and the administrative state expand into the private world of the individual while decreasing the potency of the public sphere. Instead of the individual coordinating action for the benefit of their lifeworld, individual actions come to benefit those of the economy and the administrative state. The outcome potentially increases a loss of freedom and a loss of reason for the individual. Such an outcome also decreases the fulfillment of a democratic state. In response to this process, Habermas argues that social movements have the capacity to decolonize the lifeworld. This study questions Habermas' assertion through the examination of the tobacco control social movement organization, Fight Against Corporate Tobacco, a youth-led movement in the state of Wisconsin. Fight Against Corporate Tobacco was constructed through state financing supported through Master Settlement Agreement funds. Its goal was to support peer-to-peer communication that reinforced a youth empowerment movement that fought against the tobacco industry's marketing tactics. An indirect outcome of FACT included a decrease in the prevalence of youth tobacco use. This study highlights the construction of this organization by the state government of Wisconsin and the marketing firm, Golin/Harris International, while situating this substantive process within Habermas' theory and social movement theory. Survey research into the organizational activity and meaning construction of Fight Against Corporate Tobacco was supplemented by an extensive socio-historical descriptive account of the discourse constructed by the tobacco industry, federal and state governments, and the tobacco control movement. Further research incorporated internal document analysis of tobacco industry reports, government reports, and documents from the tobacco control movement within the state of Wisconsin. The results of the study suggest that the application of privatization and/or market principles (such as branding) upon movement organizations may lead to success in achieving the goals of the organization. However, results also lead to the suggestion that the same process may also assist in the expansion of the economic and administrative spheres into our everyday lives, thus rejecting Habermas' prognosis.

The life stories of these individuals are rendered here as a means of exploring the larger, enduring question of how college students become activists and the ways they learn to cultivate the commitment to work for social change. Grounded in a biographical and narrative-based research approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with former student activists of color (three men and three women) representing three distinct eras: the 1970s, 1980s, and the early part of 2000. The student movements covered in this study include the first and third installments of the Black Action Movements, the movement to end apartheid in South Africa, the global movement to free Nelson Mandela, and the movement to end institutional racism at Michigan. The findings of this study suggest that no other event or person plays a more salient role in study participants' activist development than the other undergraduates of color they befriend during their time at Michigan. Cross-case analyses of their stories also suggest that despite significant differences in age, historical timing, gender, and personality, participants' underwent a similar process in becoming activists. Informed by the extant literature on social movements and activism, the process consists of the following steps: encountering threshold people and threshold organizations ; the building of student movements based on particular mobilizing events ; experiencing private moments of moral shocks ; receiving open, non-coercive invitations to act ; ultimately making a commitment to act ; actively working to assume personal responsibility for the movement ; learning to negotiate challenges ; and in the aftermath of participants' activism learning to endure the consequences of their actions and make peace with all that their choices have wrought, institutionally as well as personally. In the broadest sense, these personal stories provide what educators Daloz et al. (1996) have referred to as a ""different public mirror,"" one that provides a reflection of the way people can care about politics and their civic duties even in the midst of opposing social and cultural forces (p. 7). Hopefully, these stories will also provide critical insight that may later be applied to cultivating new generations of activist citizens.",304572753,,Dissertations & Theses," Navia, Christine N.NaviaN.ChristineNavia, Christine N.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1507552471 , 39689011 , 66569 , 9780549511915 , 3305048 , 3305048", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549511915, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304572753?accountid=14496," 0325 African Americans , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0745 Higher education"," 0325 African Americans , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0745 Higher education"," 0325 African Americans , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0745 Higher education",," 0325 African Americans , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0745 Higher education"," African Americans , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Activism , Michigan , Qualitative , Students of color , Undergraduates , University of Michigan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+path+to+activism%3A+A+qualitative+study+of+how+six+undergraduates+of+color+became+activists+while+attending+the+University+of+Michigan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Navia%2C+Christine+N.&amp;isbn=9780549511915&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"189,"Counter -hegemonic collective action and the politics of civil society: The case of a social movement in Kerala, India, in the context of neoliberal globalization","Social movements in various parts of the world have been attempting to challenge the forces of neoliberal globalization and the social problems caused by this economic trend. Many such movements have been advancing the idea of global civil society in order to counter 'globalization from above'. Despite the efforts of these movements to democratize social relations, the domination of these powerful forces persist and result in further oppression of marginalized people. This study attempts to discover the reasons why these social movements and civil society, despite popular support, fail to challenge effectively the power of such social forces. In particular, this study analyzes, through in-depth interviews with activists, and archival and observational data, the world-view of civil society activists in a movement against Coca-Cola initiated by the marginalized people in Kerala, India. While this struggle, popularly called the 'Plachimada movement', managed to effect the temporary closure of a Coca-Cola plant, whose operation reportedly affected the ground water in the region, the local people felt that it failed to address their conditions of marginality. The analysis of the movement's processes finds that hegemony, or indirect forms of domination, often stands in the way of such efforts at democratic social change. The study concludes with suggestions for rethinking civil society as an arena of reflexive collective action that is counter-hegemonic.",304573527,,Dissertations & Theses," Panicker, Ajaykumar P.PanickerP.AjaykumarPanicker, Ajaykumar P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1503397311 , 39615821 , 66569 , 9780549545057 , 3306736 , 3306736", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549545057, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304573527?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0344 Social research , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Social research , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Civil society , Collective action , Development , Globalization , Hegemony , India , Kerala , Neoliberal , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Counter+-hegemonic+collective+action+and+the+politics+of+civil+society%3A++The+case+of+a+social+movement+in+Kerala%2C+India%2C+in+the+context+of+neoliberal+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Panicker%2C+Ajaykumar+P.&amp;isbn=9780549545057&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"190,"Land and seeds: The cultural, ecological, and global politics of organic agriculture in Latvia and Costa Rica","This dissertation is a multi-sited ethnography of the development of organic agriculture movements in the historically, culturally, and ecologically diverse contexts of Latvia and Costa Rica. It explores how the divergent traditions and practices surrounding landscape preservation, biodiversity conservation, and seed production have shaped national-level organic movements in these countries. My research reveals that despite radically different backgrounds and strategies, both movements are limited in similar ways due to their marginal positions within their respective countries and the global economy. They share certain characteristic problems in moving organically grown products to market, which differ greatly from the trends of “conventionalization” encountered by organic sectors in the US, Western Europe, and other industrialized countries. Further, the dissertation investigates how the two organic movements have reacted to the respective regional economic integration processes of joining the European Union (EU) and resisting entry into the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). I trace the course of two specific rural development struggles over land surveying and land use practices in Latvia, and intellectual property rights over seeds in Costa Rica. These struggles reflect broader contests over understandings of cultural landscapes as formed through organic farmer practices; public versus private control over space, place and property; the formation of farmer social networks and relations; and broader ideas of democracy and participation in social and political life. I argue that the culturally specific and embedded responses to these processes of regionalization and globalization have emerged out of the different environmental and agricultural histories, political narratives and cultural symbols in each country. The Latvian organic movement tends towards re-territorialization, emphasizing the social imaginaries of the nation and land in response to the EU. In contrast the Costa Rican organic movement has joined together with other social movements in resisting CAFTA through a global perspective of interchange and circulation of ideas across borders, paralleling their emphasis on seed exchange as a form of resistance to intellectual property rights. Heated debates at the global level about the harmonization of norms for organic agriculture across such different ecological and cultural terrains reflect the difficulty of “uniting the organic world in all its diversity. 1 ” 1 Mission of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements",304592252,,Dissertations & Theses," Aistara, Guntra AndaAistaraAndaGuntraAistara, Guntra Anda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1680760971 , 39544451 , 66569 , 9780549979357 , 3342998 , 3342998", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549979357, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304592252?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0768 Environmental science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0768 Environmental science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0768 Environmental science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0473 Agriculture , 0768 Environmental science"," Cultural anthropology , Geography , Agriculture , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Biological sciences , Costa Rica , Globalization , Landscapes , Latvia , Organic agriculture , Seeds",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Land+and+seeds%3A++The+cultural%2C+ecological%2C+and+global+politics+of+organic+agriculture+in+Latvia+and+Costa+Rica&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aistara%2C+Guntra+Anda&amp;isbn=9780549979357&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"191,When the diaspora returns: Transnational racial and ethnic identity formation among Japanese Americans in global Tokyo,"This dissertation examines how Japanese Americans reconstruct their racial and ethnic identities through migration to Japan. Using a transnational framework, I show how identity constructions in Japan emerge from a combination of new experiences interacting with people in Japan, and past experiences in the United States that continue to shape self-perceptions. I use the case of Japanese Americans in Japan to reconsider how the concepts of race and ethnicity can be used to develop a comparative framework for discussing global constructions of race and ethnicity. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork in Japan, including 50 qualitative interviews with Japanese Americans living in the Tokyo area. Japanese American migration to Japan is a specific type of transnational movement: that of an ethnic group to its ancestral homeland. As a framework for comparatively discussing multiple constructions of Japaneseness in the United States and Japan, to flesh out the complexities of Japanese American “ethnic return” experiences in Japan, I theorize “Japanese” as what I call a heterogeneous global ethnic group —an ethnic group that spans national borders and is internally diverse. This concept is similar to the notion of diaspora in some ways but can enable a discussion of Japanese American migration to Japan that diaspora cannot. Three types of identity formations among Americans of Japanese ancestry in Japan can be discerned. First, Japanese Americans from the U.S. continent who can phenotypically blend into Japanese society tend to reconstruct what I term “racialized national identities” as “Japanese Americans” in Japan. Second, ethnic Japanese from Hawai'i reconstruct “Hawai'i” identities while in Japan. Finally, mixed race Japanese Americans must grapple with the category of “hāfu,” which is gaining increasing social recognition in Japan.",304599088,,Dissertations & Theses," Yamashiro, Jane HisaYamashiroHisaJaneYamashiro, Jane Hisa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1591792201 , 40988701 , 66569 , 9780549787853 , 3326464 , 3326464", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549787853, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304599088?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Asian-American , Ethnic identity , Globalization , Japan , Race & ethnicity , Tokyo , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+the+diaspora+returns%3A++Transnational+racial+and+ethnic+identity+formation+among+Japanese+Americans+in+global+Tokyo&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yamashiro%2C+Jane+Hisa&amp;isbn=9780549787853&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"192,"Émigrés: The experience of political exile for Germans and Hungarians, 1848–1871","In 1848 revolutions across Europe challenged the social and political status quo. Although they did not succeed, they in part foreshadowed, in part initiated changes that transformed European society and political culture in the following decades. As the uprisings came to an end, revolutionaries of various political convictions and social backgrounds left their home countries, creating the most heterogeneous wave of political exile in the nineteenth century. While the collective and European dimensions of the 1848 revolutions are widely studied, this is rarely done for the political exile that followed. This dissertation takes a prosopographical approach to examine the social and cultural impact of political exile following the 1848 revolutions in a transnational setting. The trajectories of émigrés from the German lands (mainly Baden and Württemberg) and from Hungary in four host societies (Switzerland, England, the United States and the Ottoman Empire) provide the framework for studying exile as a pan-European and global phenomenon. Using correspondences, diaries, memoirs, petitions for clemency, court records and government documents, the dissertation explores case studies of émigrés from various social and educational backgrounds. While exile is often considered an individual challenge, this dissertation studies its collective aspects; in particular, it locates the experience of exile in three realms: family, employment and social networks. Exploring the interconnectedness of these three areas yields insights into the ways in which new realities confronted old patterns of social and political interaction in mid-nineteenth century Europe. The expansion of the social and ideological spectrum of political movements resulted in stricter asylum practices, while host countries maintained the rhetoric of open borders. With newly-gained confidence in political participation, families effectively lobbied for amnesty for their loved ones while appealing to the monarch's ""fatherly love,"" using the language of the pre-revolutionary era. Unwilling labor migrants, émigrés had to adapt skills that had earned them social prestige at home to the realities of the international labor market. Similar tensions characterized émigrés' social networks and their decision to return from exile. Instigators yet also victims of the changes taking place around them, émigrés formed an emblematic group within Europe in the mid-nineteenth century.",304600387,,Dissertations & Theses," Toth, HelenaTothHelenaToth, Helena",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1617327661 , 40045101 , 66569 , 9780549882411 , 3334807 , 3334807", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549882411, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304600387?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Germans , Germany, history, 19th century , Hungarians , Hungary, history, 19th century , Migration , Migration, 19th century , Political exile , Political exile, 19th century , Revolution of 1848",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%C3%89migr%C3%A9s%3A+The+experience+of+political+exile+for%0AGermans+and+Hungarians%2C+1848%E2%80%931871&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Toth%2C+Helena&amp;isbn=9780549882411&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"193,Flexible acculturation: On Taiwanese relocations to China,"In this study, I discuss the concept “flexible acculturation” and apply it to the case of Taiwanese transmigration processes to China. “Flexibility” is an important notion in studies of globalization that describes how different social actors respond to opportunities provided in transnational social fields. I identify main characteristics of “flexible acculturation”: it is broad enough to describe not only different groups of migrants but also governments, publics, etc.; it is not only about differences but interactions; it is about both processes and the results; it might be liberated as well as restricted. I also discuss how “flexible acculturation” is different from many other concepts that have been proposed, e.g. flexible citizenship, flexible ethnicity, instrumental identity, and multiculturalism. In my case study, I focus on the flexible cultural strategies of the Taiwanese government, the businesspeople, and the women. Three strategies of the Taiwanese government are identified: governance in spatial movements, graduated sovereignty, and reinvention of ethnic identities. My discussion about the businesspeople focuses on the interplay between identity politics, family life, and children's education. I argue that different economic positions shape the migration patterns and the acculturation strategies. I then discuss how the transmigration processes influence Taiwanese women's social images, careers, ties to the children, spatial relocations, household division of labor, and self-perception. I argue that among the issues associated with women, gender, and family, the problem of the extramarital affairs between Taiwanese men and Chinese women is singled out in the Taiwanese acculturation processes because this problem involves both Taiwanese (us) and Chinese people (them). The data used in the dissertation includes in-depth interviews, governmental documents, and media reports. In 2003 and 2005, I conducted fifty-one interviews of businesspeople and their family members in Taiwan and in China. Since 2002, I have also collected documents of many social institutions, including governments, political parties, media, social movement organizations, and online forums for the public. The date of these documents ranged from the early 1980s to 2007.",304606386,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Hsiang-ChiehLeeHsiang-ChiehLee, Hsiang-Chieh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1630737951 , 41672181 , 66569 , 9780549909620 , 3337840 , 3337840", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549909620, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304606386?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0938 Demography"," 0344 Social research , 0938 Demography"," 0344 Social research , 0938 Demography",," 0344 Social research , 0938 Demography"," Social research , Demography , Acculturation , Relocation , China"," Social sciences , Acculturation , China , Family , Globalization , Relocations , State , Taiwan , Transmigration , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Flexible+acculturation%3A++On+Taiwanese+relocations+to+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Hsiang-Chieh&amp;isbn=9780549909620&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"194,"New Bolivians, new Bolivia: Pentecostal conversion and neoliberal transformation in contemporary Bolivia","Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Cochabamba, Bolivia, this dissertation analyzes discourses of transformation among Pentecostal Christians within the context of recent neoliberal social and economic reforms that have drastically altered Bolivian society. These reforms have caused immense suffering among Bolivia's impoverished majority and placed increasing pressures on the middle and working classes, as they struggle to provide for themselves and their families. The recently intensified rise in Pentecostalism is correlative with the social and political impact of these reforms, and I argue that Pentecostalism is one way in which marginalized Bolivians are creating new identities and building new coalitions in the face of a changing social order and a diminished relationship with the state. To this end, I examine two intersecting processes of change central to the understanding what is at stake for Bolivian Pentecostals: (1) personal transformation as effected and marked by ""born-again” conversion; and (2) social transformation as promised by the rhetoric of a ""new Bolivia"" as Pentecostals seek to remake Bolivian society in their own image. I argue that social engagement on the part of Bolivian Pentecostals can be understood by looking at the ways in which Pentecostals conceive of conversion—not only as being ""born again,"" but as being ""healed."" The Pentecostal discourse on suffering and illness is not generally that of rewards in the afterlife, but rather emphasizes healing and other forms of personal and social transformation in the present. It provides a framework for thinking about the suffering and lack of opportunity that come with poverty and living in the Third World and a practical mode of action through which many Bolivian Pentecostals attempt to effect both personal and social change. This transformational project extends to the global level as well. Bolivian Pentecostals are engaging with discourses of globalization, both through reinterpreting the secular processes and hegemonic meanings of globalization through a lens of ""end-times"" theology, and through understanding themselves as part of a global evangelical Christian movement.",304606715,,Dissertations & Theses," Wightman, Jill MarieWightmanMarieJillWightman, Jill Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1547551581 , 40218731 , 66569 , 9780549639879 , 3314937 , 3314937", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549639879, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304606715?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Bolivia , Cochabamba , Conversion , Neoliberalism , Pentecostalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+Bolivians%2C+new+Bolivia%3A+Pentecostal+conversion+and+neoliberal+transformation+in+contemporary+Bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wightman%2C+Jill+Marie&amp;isbn=9780549639879&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"195,The social movement of spiritually engaged alternative education in Thailand against the background of reform and globalization,"The establishment of alternative education, private foundations, and networks linked to socio-political and spiritual advocacies distinguishes the Thai social movement in this research. This research is a qualitative study that has made use of historical accounts to associate with data gathered from extensive interviews and case studies in order to inquire as to whether alternative education represents an historical spiritual tradition of opposition to reform hegemony, and whether it has had an impact on state reform efforts. Also investigated was whether there are some historical patterns associated with the manner in which the state of Thailand has dealt with the forces of globalization and whether the collective action by informal movements of Thai people also has the same predictable pattern of response to the global. Analysis and comparison of these issues contribute in determining the values associated with people in the alternative education movement and the motives and intentions associated with state-initiated reforms. A further related aspect explored is the degree of ""Thai-ness"" and the embedded historical pattern of both the alternative education movement and education reform. These inquiries were answered through the collection of data from three different trips to Thailand over a four-year period, the last trip a one-year stay that permitted case studies and observations at three alternative schools, and the interview of a host of participants from home-school parents and students to Ministry of Education staff and officers. In examining the data, a clearer notion of what lies underneath the idea of Buddhist education and spirituality became clearer and how educational reform based on Western ideals and notions has not taken into account Buddhism and culture as education. This illumination brings new insight and also raises a new question as to the difference between social movements in a Buddhist nation such as Thailand and social movements in the West.",304608089,,Dissertations & Theses," Jones, Michael ErnestJonesErnestMichaelJones, Michael Ernest",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1747771891 , 39376991 , 66569 , 9781109127119 , 3354901 , 3354901", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109127119, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304608089?accountid=14496," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0727 Curriculum development"," Religion , Philosophy , Cultural anthropology , Curriculum development"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Education , Alternative education , Education decentralization , Engaged Buddhism , Homeschooling , Social movements , Thailand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+social+movement+of+spiritually+engaged+alternative+education+in+Thailand+against+the+background+of+reform+and+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Michael+Ernest&amp;isbn=9781109127119&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"196,Errant family ties: Migratory identities in Latina and Hispanic Caribbean cultural production,"This dissertation examines how contemporary cultural production from Hispanic Caribbean and Latina female voices have altered patterns of the traditional family unit and a modern conceptualization of the nation-state. In the literary trajectory of Latin American and Caribbean cultures, the family has functioned as the allegory of nation formation. Moreover, both nation and family have been delineated within territorial demarcations of space. In this sense, I affirm that contemporary female authors and film makers from the Hispanic Caribbean challenge the productivity of the traditional family unit and of a sense of nationhood reduced to the islands. The physical movement to the United States or to other Caribbean islands offers alternative romances and alliances constructed through homosexuality, through the contact with individuals from the same country of origin, or of other ethnicities, races, and nationalities. Also new family patterns framed through adoption are being built by the characters. Nevertheless, these new alignments presuppose ephemeral relations that fade away in the geographical spaces of the islands once the protagonists return, for one reason or another. That is, the physical movement that allows them to become emancipated and autonomous opens up spaces of new commitments that are however interrupted in the insular spaces. On the other hand, the transnational context does not present a whole picture of hopeful and liberatory social practices since, at some points, female, homosexual, transgender or racial identities face social constrictions in the host culture. By providing a detailed analysis of homosexual, transgender and racialized female migratory patterns and their relation to the traditional family unit and the nation, I contribute to a remaking of cultures that mirrors contemporary processes of globalization and of uneven relation between historically identified First and Third World countries. As I argue, Hispanic Caribbean cultural production reflects the new realities of the transnational Caribbean even as it attempts to reshape traditional associations between nation and family. In this direction, my dissertation dialogues with other disciplines concerned with current contexts of migration that envision changes in family patterns and alternative forms of kinship. As it is in the case of the literary and cinematic production from the Hispanic Caribbean, global, social and ethnographical studies gradually reflect new family dynamics and the struggles suffered by individuals who necessarily or voluntarily migrate. I am mainly interested in the transformations undergone within literary and cinematic projects of nationhood and family when the characters return to their places of origin. Could we envision a hopeful futurity or do we attend to a reaffirmation of traditional paradigms on nation and family? Therefore, my dissertation develops a new dimension of literary and visual criticism that similar to other disciplines projects contemporary patterns of female, homosexual and transgender migrations in the Hispanic Caribbean.",304625645,,Dissertations & Theses," Del-Rio, IruneDel-RioIruneDel-Rio, Irune",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1629819071 , 40465401 , 66569 , 9780549908500 , 3337747 , 3337747", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549908500, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304625645?accountid=14496, 0737 Hispanic American studies, 0737 Hispanic American studies, 0737 Hispanic American studies,, 0737 Hispanic American studies, Hispanic American studies," Social sciences , Caribbean , Cultural production , Family , Hispanic , Latina , Nation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Errant+family+ties%3A+Migratory+identities+in+Latina+and+Hispanic+Caribbean+cultural+production&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Del-Rio%2C+Irune&amp;isbn=9780549908500&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"197,"Effects of lethal management on behaviors, social networks, and movements of overabundant white -tailed deer","I investigated the impacts of lethal management on behaviors, social affiliations, and resulting susceptibility to vehicle collisions of overabundant white-tailed deer using Global Positioning System collars. I compared weekly kernel home range sizes, 1-hour movements, and escape distances during controlled hunting in one herd (65% reduction) and sharpshooting (91% reduction) in another. Weekly home ranges increased during controlled hunting (F 13 =4.6, p &lt;0.001) and normalized thereafter. Weekly home ranges did not differ during sharpshooting, but increased 2-weeks post-shoot (F 13 =2.4, p &lt;0.005). Mean 1-hour movements and escape distances differed for both herds during lethal management. Deer exposed to sharpshooting increased home range size by more than 400% 1-year post-shoot. Results suggest that sharpshooting techniques educate fewer animals, allowing for more efficient and greater herd reduction. Daily minimum convex polygon home ranges were estimated for each animal for each of 42 days encompassing lethal removals for both herds. Daily home range overlap for each deer pair combination was calculated for the hunted herd (n=88) and for the sharpshot herd (n=153) to determine social affiliations. Increased social interactions were witnessed for only sharpshot female-female (F 5 =3.2, p &lt;0.01) and female-male (F 5 =2.3, p &lt;0.05) combinations post-shoot. Deer shifted out of pre-shoot ranges to become more social (F 4 =2.0, p &lt;0.10, α=0.10). There were no differences in social interactions post-hunt. Results show that previous reports of geographically rigid home ranges under reduced density underestimated the influence of the matrilineal social network in terms of site fidelity. To assess increased susceptibility to vehicle collisions, home ranges were estimated during hunting, 1-month, and 1-year post-hunt. Road mileage contained within home ranges was calculated. Mean 1-hour movements, movements by time of day, and daily road crossings were determined. Home ranges were larger during hunting (F 2,38 =10.4, p &lt;0.001). Home range size was positively correlated with road mileage contained within (r 1,41 =0.94, p &lt;0.001) for the three intervals combined. Mean 1-hour movements increased and deer became more nocturnal during hunting. Daily road crossings did not increase during hunting. While hunting temporarily alters behavioral patterns, it does not increase the chances of deer being involved in vehicle collisions as increased home range sizes and movements did not increase road crossing frequency.",304629045,,Dissertations & Theses," Williams, Scott ColbyWilliamsColbyScottWilliams, Scott Colby",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1507554471 , 39690061 , 66569 , 9780549548454 , 3308256 , 3308256", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549548454, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304629045?accountid=14496, 0478 Forestry, 0478 Forestry, 0478 Forestry,, 0478 Forestry, Forestry," Biological sciences , Deer-vehicle collisions , Lethal management , Odocoileus virginianus , Social networks , White-tailed deer",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Effects+of+lethal+management+on+behaviors%2C+social+networks%2C+and+movements+of+overabundant+white+-tailed+deer&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Scott+Colby&amp;isbn=9780549548454&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"198,"Tied above, pressed below: Security alliances, social movements, and the politics of overseas U.S. military bases","Do social movements matter in security politics? Connecting the international relations literature with social movement theories, my research examines how bilateral security alliances influence state-society interaction and social movement outcomes in the politics of overseas U.S military bases. Investigating how host governments react to anti-base movement pressure while managing alliance relations with the U.S., I argue that the host government's response in finding a balance depends on the level of security consensus held by political elites regarding national security. When host government political elites are significantly divided regarding their perception of national security and U.S.-host state security relations, elites sympathetic to anti-base movements cooperatively engage anti-base activists. Thus a weak security consensus opens the possibility for major base policy changes by anti-base movements. Conversely, when a common consensus regarding security relations with the U.S. exists among domestic political elites, the host government strategically responds to anti-base pressure by either ignoring, foot-dragging, co-opting, or at best, making token concessions to anti-base groups. By providing minimal concessions, host governments are able to maintain positive relations with the U.S. while mollifying major anti-base protests. Social movements, therefore, have little effect on base policy outcomes under conditions of strong security consensus. I use movement episodes in five different countries - Philippines, Japan, Italy, Ecuador, and South Korea - to support my argument. The findings are based on government reports and documents, internal activist documents, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with activists, host government elites, and U.S. officials.",304635013,,Dissertations & Theses," Yeo, Andrew InyupYeoInyupAndrewYeo, Andrew Inyup",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1663052551 , 42226191 , 66569 , 9780549967941 , 3339774 , 3339774", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549967941, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304635013?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," Social sciences , Alliance , Military base , National security , Protest , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tied+above%2C+pressed+below%3A++Security+alliances%2C+social+movements%2C+and+the+politics+of+overseas+U.S.+military+bases&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yeo%2C+Andrew+Inyup&amp;isbn=9780549967941&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"199,Voices from below: Locating the underground in post-World War II American literature,"This dissertation begins with the premise that scrutinizing imaginative representations of the underground can give us insight into its prevalence as an organizing principle in our cultural consciousness. Moreover, such a study is unbound to any particular identity or movement and thus offers a compelling framework for tracing our evolving conceptions of national identity and citizenship through intersecting histories of the dispossessed. Situating the underground in the historical and political context of the Cold War and beyond, I examine stories of resistance through a locale that is spatially configured as literally or figuratively below , in which those driven below the radar of their communities by social and political commitments animate what Richard Wright calls “the underground logic of the democratic process.” I begin with Richard Wright's invocation of the underground as a topography of African-American life in The Man Who Lived Underground , which uses an old sewer to activate psychological links between rising and freedom in the pre-Civil Rights era. Shifting to the 1950s hipster culture, I argue that the subterranean imperative is cultural. In The Subterraneans , Jack Kerouac magnifies the contradictions of the hipster movement fraught with the social inequalities of the era by recuperating the democratic potential of cross-racial identification in ghostly reimaginings of Cherokees repopulating the land. I continue by tracing the underground's political iterations in the 1960s and 1970s, in which questions of nationhood emerge through global alliances formed by the activist youth movement. In American Woman , Susan Choi stages a feminist corrective to the excesses of the radical fugitive underground by providing a platform for redressing Japanese American Internment through a critique of U.S. imperialism. Finally, I argue that at the close of the twentieth century, the underground is the place where intersections between metaphorical and geopolitical borders are magnified—where the material meets the symbolic most acutely. In Mosquito , Gayl Jones depicts a “new” Underground Railroad that spirits undocumented migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border, linking nineteenth-century anti-slavery crusades to the contemporary immigration rights movement. Jones inscribes a Pan-American vision into our national imaginary by interpolating population fluidity through the figure of the refugee and denaturalizing the border. In the twenty-first century, the underground offers the displaced subjects of official American histories possibilities for reinscription through a newly conceptualized cosmopolitanism. Their stories from below weave a narrative of solidarity between subjugated peoples throughout American history. The geography of such an underground presents new possibilities for transcultural and transnational mappings, which can provide a richer understanding of our intertwined pasts and a clearer blueprint for both local accountability and global mindedness.",304642393,,Dissertations & Theses," Vlagopoulos, PennyVlagopoulosPennyVlagopoulos, Penny",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1614926971 , 38618851 , 66569 , 9780549858751 , 3333455 , 3333455", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549858751, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304642393?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , American literature , Choi, Susan , Jones, Gayl , Kerouac, Jack , Post-World War II American literature , Postwar , Underground , Underground resistance , Wright, Richard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Voices+from+below%3A+Locating+the+underground+in+post-World+War+II+American+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vlagopoulos%2C+Penny&amp;isbn=9780549858751&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"200,"Defiant institutionalization: Democratization and social movements in South Korea, 1984–2002","This dissertation examines the interaction between democratization and social movements in post-transition South Korea. Using a wide range of data, I trace changing interactions among major political actors, including social movements, political parties and the government, in order to analyze the trajectory of contentious democratization in South Korea. I take the relations among varying social movement groups (degree of internal solidarity) and the relationship between social movements and institutionalized politics (degree of political autonomy) as the main foci of analysis. History of past contention and transnational influences are also discussed to provide insight into the broader context within which such relations materialized. In the course, I demonstrate how the South Korean social movement community could maintain strong influence and eventually settle as an independent political actor and institution that articulates, aggregates, and represents societal interests and programs, despite enduring instability in the political process. I use the term defiant institutionalization to describe the unconventional pattern of social movement institutionalization. The findings challenge mainstream theories that view either cooptation or marginalization of social movements as predicted outcomes of social movements in the context of democratization. The prevailing idea that unrestrained mobilization threatens democratic consolidation is also challenged. Instead, I show an alternative trajectory of contentious democratization, in which a highly mobilized social movement sector has filled in a void created by the instability and incapacity of institutionalized actors. Once we start perceiving social movements as an indispensable component of contemporary democracy, we are able to recognize the positive role they play in complementing democratic processes.",304643035,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Sun-ChulKimSun-ChulKim, Sun-Chul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1540602071 , 40150661 , 66569 , 9780549657477 , 3317651 , 3317651", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549657477, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304643035?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure," Social sciences , Contentious politics , Democratization , Institutionalization , Korea , Social movements , South Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defiant+institutionalization%3A+Democratization+and+social+movements+in+South+Korea%2C+1984%E2%80%932002&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Sun-Chul&amp;isbn=9780549657477&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"201,Growing up and rising up: Teenage girl activists and social movements in the Americas,"Teenage girls are active participants and leaders in a variety of social movements, organizing around a wide range of political issues, yet they are often invisible. Located at the intersection of the literatures on girlhood, social movements, youth civic engagement, globalization, and transnational feminism, this dissertation illuminates the experiences and perspectives of these uniquely positioned agents of social change. A multi-site, transnational ethnography, the study is based on in-depth interviews and participant observation with 75 high-school-aged girl activists in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mexico City, Caracas, Buenos Aires, and Vancouver. The first half of the dissertation explores how teenage girls construct activist identities. After addressing girls' routes into activism and their conceptions of what it means to be an activist, I demonstrate that girl activists refuse the common adult view that they must be extraordinary individuals. I look at their complex relationship to girlhood, arguing that they view girlhood as both diametrically opposed to activist identity and simultaneously supporting it, and explore how they construct social movement standing and authority for young people. The second half of the dissertation examines girl activists’ social movement strategies and collective political practices. Despite the many differences in girls’ ideologies, experiences, contexts, and tactics, there are several commonalities in their approaches to activism, including their commitment to learning and the ongoing process of education, their interest in building participatory activist communities, and their spirit of hopefulness and optimism. These three tendencies in girls’ activism reflect some of the most fruitful and dynamic elements of contemporary adult radicalism—elements developed by other groups historically subordinated in both dominant and oppositional politics. Faced with their own experiences of exclusion and tokenization, constructing activist identities in complex relation to the categories of girlhood and youth, and emerging as political actors in the context of an international upsurge in prefigurative and process-oriented social movements, teenage girl activists draw upon and contribute to this configuration of open-ended and horizontal radical political practices in the Americas.",304659344,,Dissertations & Theses," Taft, Jessica KarenTaftKarenJessicaTaft, Jessica Karen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1605142141 , 41209191 , 66569 , 9780549843511 , 3330459 , 3330459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549843511, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304659344?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," Womens studies , Sociology , Girls , Teenagers , Activists , Social change , North America , South America"," Social sciences , Activists , Adolescents , Alter-globalization , Argentina , British Columbia , California , Girls , Girls' studies , Latin America , Mexico , Political identity , Radical politics , Social movements , Venezuela",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Growing+up+and+rising+up%3A+Teenage+girl+activists+and+social+movements+in+the+Americas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Taft%2C+Jessica+Karen&amp;isbn=9780549843511&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"202,"International legal movements against war crimes, terrorism, and genocide, 1919–1948","This dissertation investigates a fundamental transformation that began with World War One: the application of domestic institutions of prosecution and punishment to the international level. Historians have studied the history of war crimes trials and certain international conventions, but they have not explained the development of a legal-political system that was supposed to protect states and citizens from different types of political and social violence. Why was the idea of an international criminal court proposed for acts as diverse as war, war crimes, terrorism, and genocide? The dissertation analyzes the negotiation of penalty clauses in the Versailles Treaty, proposals for international criminal courts in the 1920s, the 1937 Convention for the Repression and Punishment of International Terrorism, the first Nuremberg Trial, and the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide of 1948. Using institutional archives and jurists' papers, this dissertation shows that the concept of a court and new international criminal laws were stimulated by World Wars One and Two, the repeated breakdown in the European state system, new forms of warfare, and the rise of native fascist and Nazi movements. But they were also catalyzed by other developments: a trend to complete the international system with a criminal court, a moral turn toward individual responsibility, and the rise of the idea that groups, rather than individuals, needed to be protected against certain types of nation-states. Multiple networks and organizations developed international criminal law. Lawyers such as Vespasien Pella, Raphael Lemkin, and Jacob Robinson had diverse motives: nationalism, humanitarianism, retribution, prevention, universalism, and particularism. Great Power support was an important factor in determining whether projects succeeded or failed, but there were other factors. Jurists were more likely to succeed when they accommodated large and small states' needs for sovereignty. Governments preferred projects aiming at single problems with great symbolic value, rather than new systems designed to govern international politics. Finally, the development of international criminal courts, new laws against war crimes, and international systems to protect human rights were not always part of the same historical trajectory in this period.",304661809,,Dissertations & Theses," Lewis, Mark AlanLewisAlanMarkLewis, Mark Alan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1710343761 , 40350761 , 66569 , 9781109079227 , 3351606 , 3351606", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109079227, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304661809?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law"," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law"," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law",," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law"," European history , Law , Modern history , International law"," Social sciences , Genocide , International criminal court , Legal movements , Lemkin, Raphael , Pella, Vespasien , Robinson, Jacob , Terrorism , War crimes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=International+legal+movements+against+war+crimes%2C+terrorism%2C%0Aand+genocide%2C+1919%E2%80%931948&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lewis%2C+Mark+Alan&amp;isbn=9781109079227&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"203,Failing to contain religion: The emergence of a Protestant movement in contemporary China,"The dissertation examines the rapid growth of Chinese Protestant numbers from fewer than a million members in 1949 to more than 40 million Chinese today. I analyze the Chinese Communist Party regime's top-down efforts to contain Protestantism within churches under the Three Self Protestant Movement (TSPM) mass organization and the societal resistance by Protestants worshiping in unregistered churches outside Party-state control. Substantively, I argue that to understand Protestant practice today, it is necessary to grasp the Party-state's continued attempt to control Protestantism since the 1950s. Further, the Cultural Revolution represented a turning point because the breakdown in regime hegemony led to a form of Protestantism practiced in private spaces, led by ordinary believers, and shaped by counter-hegemonic values. In the reform era state regulation has replaced coercion as the CCP's primary strategy, but the Party-state still seeks to contain religious growth inside TSPM churches and by reshaping Protestant collective identities and doctrines through state nationalism. These efforts have largely failed as many Protestants worship in unregistered churches and a substantial portion worship in a gray zone between TSPM churches and unregistered churches. Analytically, I draw on social movement theory to develop the concept ""religious leadership capital"" as a way to analyze how leaders mobilize followers by reference to shared narratives that embed believers' actions in a context beyond the here-and-now of secular reality. I also extend work on social-movement collective-identity construction to suggest one way to conceptualize how differing state and societal priorities alter the relative importance of religion and nationalism in Protestant religious identities. Chinese Protestants in unregistered churches today have rejected Party-state hegemony to operate in private spaces, where they have fashioned counter-hegemonic identities that provide alternative values, offer new organizational skills, and build transnational networks. By challenging dominant cultural values in organizations outside state control, Chinese Protestantism may be considered an emerging, religiously-based social movement motivated to achieve long term cultural goals.",304697161,,Dissertations & Theses," Vala, Carsten TimothyValaTimothyCarstenVala, Carsten Timothy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1790187281 , 41201361 , 66569 , 9781109097283 , 3353291 , 3353291", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109097283, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304697161?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Religion , Political science , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , China , Chinese Christianity , Chinese Protestantism , Chinese religion , Church-state relations , Protestant , Religious movement , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Failing+to+contain+religion%3A+The+emergence+of+a+Protestant+movement+in+contemporary+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vala%2C+Carsten+Timothy&amp;isbn=9781109097283&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"204,History unhoused: Imagining redress in post-imperial Britain,"""History Unhoused: Imagining Redress in Post-imperial Britain,"" investigates the way in which contemporary narratives and performances of migration dislodge violent colonial and postcolonial histories from their particular sites of encounter, and interrogates the politics of new migrant public cultures in transit across global terrain. The dissertation analyzes the critical and theoretical issues surrounding the reproduction of violence within colonial, postcolonial, and neo-colonial regimes, and considers in particular the problem of responsibility and redress at the heart of postcolonial creative practices. Specifically, the dissertation considers what I see as a generational turn to a creative, performative historical engagement in contemporary black British narratives of migration, narratives that stage a critical redressive historiography by imagining the possibility of historical justice in the face its undeniable belatedness and insufficiency. I argue that such a critical redress is founded on a situated ethics operating outside of the logic of monetary equivalency such as reparations or restitution. While I examine contemporary transnational public cultures formed through movements between Britain and its former colonies, I am also concerned with the long-durational history of displacements that have followed from the advance of mercantile and then industrial capitalism, and subsequently colonialism and imperialism. I analyze the way in which the exhibition of visual, literary, and performative texts brings this history into public, restructures both contemporary British and transnational social imaginaries, and opens up new spaces for the critique of violence and the appeal for social justice. The texts I discuss circulate within both British and transnational publics, and are created by writers and artists from various postcolonial locales in Africa and the Caribbean. In this interdisciplinary project I consider the novelists Fred D'Aguiar and Caryl Phillips, the performance poet Dorothea Smartt, and film, video and installation artists Isaac Julien, Yinka Shonibare, and Inge Blackman. I demonstrate how embodied experiences of publicness—in and through the performance, exhibition, and circulation of their literary, visual and performance texts—open up a space through which we might imagine a redress ""to come.""",304697243,,Dissertations & Theses," Blevins, Steven RyanBlevinsRyanStevenBlevins, Steven Ryan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1621834171 , 41513441 , 66569 , 9780549903895 , 3336223 , 3336223", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549903895, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304697243?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Modern literature , Black studies , British and Irish literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Great Britain , Historiography , History , Migrations , Post-imperial Britain , Postcolonial , Redress",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=History+unhoused%3A+Imagining+redress+in+post-imperial+Britain&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blevins%2C+Steven+Ryan&amp;isbn=9780549903895&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"205,"Tradition, libéralisme et communautarisme durant les «Trente glorieuses»: Les étudiants de Moncton et l'entrée dans la modernité avancée des francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick, 1957–1969","This dissertation examines Acadian history during the ""Trente glorieuses"" (1945-1975, or Eric Hobsbawm ""Golden Age"") with an emphasis on student political activity during the years 1957-1969. Its principal objective is to bring about a better understanding of the ways by which New Brunswick's (Canada) francophone population entered into ""advanced modernity"". It argues that there were not one, but two successive student movements in Moncton, with February 1968 acting as a pivot between the two. These two movements were distinct with regards to ideology: while the first was clearly liberal in its inspiration (emphasizing citizen participation in the Canadian polity and economy), the second tended towards cultural autonomism (focusing on acquiring rights and autonomy for the ethnolinguistic ""community""). This study analyses how this important discursive transformation occurred and illustrates how the latter movement must be considered as the starting point of the Acadian ""neo-nationalism"" of the 1970s. Far from considering these two student movements as pure products of regional politics, this study identifies remarkable similarities and synchronicities between the Acadian student ideologies and their North American counterparts. In doing so, it illustrates how large-scale cultural currents can take different forms as they take hold in particular—and peripheral—socio-political contexts. It also identifies certain conditions that facilitate the spread of ""global"" ideological movements into particular social environments. Keywords.

While it focuses on the global meetings at Porto Alegre (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005) and Mumbai (2004), the dissertation pays especial attention to Latin American actors and debates, seeking to conceptualize this historically unprecedented phenomenon of social mobilization. Rather than settling activists' dilemma about whether the WSF is (and should be) a space or a movement, the dissertation reconstructs it as both, through different theoretical lenses. It thus analyzes the WSF as a global space of communication, as a political field within global civil society, and as a global movement of movements. The dissertation emphasizes the self-reflexive and self-democratizing resources of the Forum, as it highlights key tensions between “totalizing oriented” and “self-limiting, sphere specific” types of utopias. The dissertation also asks about how this radically heterogeneous collection of civil society organizations articulated, most of the times, in transnational networks challenge the discourse of neo-liberalism. Besides a program of socioeconomic reform, neo-liberalism is conceptualized as a “mentality of government” and a cultural discourse that became pensamiento único (single thought) around the globe, but more forcefully in Latin America, during the 1990s. Taking struggles against water privatization as a paradigmatic case of social justice struggles against neo-liberalism at the Forum, the dissertation reconstructs principles and regularities of the “WSF mentality”. It claims that transnational networks at the WSF, search publicity in decision-making processes with a politics of disclosure, and plurality to authorize socioeconomic policy decisions with a cultural politics of diversity. The dissertation also argues that networks at the WSF struggle to re-frame the grammar of social justice beyond the nation-state with a politics that intertwines global, national and local scales.",304835445,,Dissertations & Theses," Perera, VeronicaPereraVeronicaPerera, Veronica",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1614926981 , 41392671 , 66569 , 9780549859123 , 3333083 , 3333083", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549859123, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304835445?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Sociology , Social structure , Neoliberalism , Hispanics , Conferences"," Social sciences , Globalization , Latin America , Latin American social movements , Neoliberalism , Social movements , Twenty-fist century civil society , Water privatization , World Social Forum",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Challenging+Neo-liberalism+from+below%3A+The+World+Social+Forum+2001%E2%80%932005&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perera%2C+Veronica&amp;isbn=9780549859123&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"207,Crossing borders with Elias Amidon and Elizabeth Roberts: A biography of engaged spiritual lives,"This biographical dissertation examines the partnership of Elias Amidon and Elizabeth Roberts, two spiritually based social activists.

By means of extensive interviews and other modes of inquiry, this study explores relevant social movements and spiritual lineages, including global citizen diplomacy, peace teams, deep ecology and environmental education, engaged Buddhism, and Sufism of the Inayat Khan lineage. Amidon and Roberts have been active in peace, social justice, and environmental movements for the past 30 years. This biography explores turning points in their lives and the larger historical and social movements they have helped shape, and have been shaped by, thus illuminating a larger story of socially engaged spirituality. The researcher draws upon Amidon and Roberts' published and unpublished writings and upon secondary materials, oral interviews, and material artifacts. The dissertation includes a literature review that draws selectively upon sources within the broadly defined field of interpretive research (specifically biographical inquiry) and a research methods chapter. While narratives by and about the most well-known exemplars of socially engaged spirituality are critical to our understanding of ourselves and our world, by themselves they are incomplete. We also need the vision and practical example provided by stories of citizen-activists such as Elias Amidon and Elizabeth Roberts. Like hundreds of thousands of citizen-activists around the world, their stories—and the stories of the local and transnational movements for nonviolent social change they have helped create—are largely unknown.

In addition, theories and practices of immigrant media and social movements provide constructive perspectives discussing characteristics forms of collective actions for immigrant communities ( local-global, transnational, and heterogeneous ; roles of immigrant media ( movement resource and cultural resource ) in a host society. However, we are less informed about communication processes for migrant agents to construct migrant social movement. Much less is discussed about communication processes and their implications of media communications of immigrant media. Thus, to bridge the theoretical and practical gaps, this dissertation research attempt to contextualize communication processes of an immigrant media, MWTV, engaged in the migrant social movement in order to explore how relatively powerless migrant agents develop alternative forms and ways of praxis for social change through their media communications. Throughout two field research, this particular research could identify a ‘ asymmetric power structure ’ formed through the relations between diverse social agencies related to the processes for social changes for the immigrant communities in Korea, which induce ‘ the mediated praxis ’ shaping ‘ asymmetric solidarity, ’ ‘ objectification of the migrant agents, ’ and ‘ assimilation of movement culture. ’ Then, the immigrant media, MWTV have been developed to ‘ remediate ’ existing dominant forms and ways of social changes constitutive of ‘ dialogic praxis ’ of the foreign agents. Thus, media communication of immigrant media is viewed as conscious collective actions to ‘remediate mediated praxis’ for social and cultural change in a host society rather than mere symbolic resources for social or cultural reorientation. It means that the flexible, collaborator, and reflective communication structure of MWTV are deliberately reconstructed not as ‘conditions’ but as ‘consequences’ of critical reflection on mediated praxis.",734625299,,Dissertations & Theses," Chae, Young GilChaeGilYoungChae, Young Gil",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2098139381 , 42539311 , 66569 , 9781124079301 , 3409987 , 3409987", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781124079301, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/734625299?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0708 Mass communications"," 0629 Labor relations , 0708 Mass communications"," 0629 Labor relations , 0708 Mass communications",," 0629 Labor relations , 0708 Mass communications"," Labor relations , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Communication processes for social change , Development communication , Dialogic , Ethnic media , Immigrant media , Korea , Social change , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Immigrant+media+and+communication+processes+for+social+change+in+Korea%3A+A+case+study+of+migrant+workers+television&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chae%2C+Young+Gil&amp;isbn=9781124079301&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"209,"Territorialized cosmopolitanism: Space, place and cosmopolitan identity","This dissertation examines postcolonial narrative fiction as a site of cosmopolitanism that is self-consciously local and global at the same time. I argue that, in order to think through a form of cosmopolitanism that takes seriously questions of social justice, we must think through the way cosmopolitan world-views are articulated in place . Much is made of the deterritorializing forces of both cosmopolitanism and globalization, but, as the novels I examine suggest, this ignores the simultaneous re- and multi-territorialization that is always ongoing. This gap in cosmopolitan theory means that everyday lived cosmopolitanism, which enacts this oscillation between the global and the local, is often left outside the scope of theory. Fiction offers a corrective to cosmopolitan theory by paying particular attention to that which is often outside of the scope of this theoretical paradigm. Postcolonial theory's emphasis on the importance of political responsibility and the remembrance of past and ongoing violence informs this project. In this dissertation, I primarily engage with the two dominating strains of cosmopolitan theory: liberal-bourgeois cosmopolitanism and vernacular cosmopolitanism. I read these theoretical models alongside cultural geography and eco-criticism to account for what I term ""territorialized cosmopolitanism."" I suggest that territorialized cosmopolitanism enacts a dialectical movement between the global and the local and this movement between these two zones prompts ethical and political responsibilities to others (both human and non-human) both physically nearby and distant – reflecting the shaping role place—defined in physical and cultural terms– has in developing cosmopolitanism. Focussing my reading on novels that address cosmopolitanism through different kinds of places (the metropolis, the regional city, and the rural community), I argue that different places focus a territorialized cosmopolitan sensibility in different ways.

The thesis uncovers how the networked nature of political activity is organised and spread throughout the â��Tibet Movementâ��.Â  This is done by exploring the following questions:Â  How do these networks actually work?Â  What are the everyday processes that hold these networks together?Â  How are these networks spatially constituted?Â  How can we study these networks?Â  What impacts does this approach have upon our research methods?Â  Empirically, it takes three elements of the whole of the Tibet issue and examines them as discrete themes which help to define and shape the issue in particular ways.Â  These are, broadly: 1) the constitution and actualisation of imaginative geographies of Tibet; 2) the construction and maintenance of the Tibetan nation in the Tibetan diaspora and; 3) the role of activism and political contestation in promoting the pro-Tibetan struggle.",898749716,,Dissertations & Theses," Davies, Andrew DanielDaviesDanielAndrewDavies, Andrew Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488042941 , 64925561 , 101309 , U523636 , U523636", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898749716?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," 507455 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Networks+of+transitional+tibetan+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davies%2C+Andrew+Daniel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"211,The concrete poetry movement in Britain and avant-gardism,"The Concrete poetry movement was an international movement of visual and sound poetry during the nineteen sixties.Â  This thesis is an account of the Concrete poetry movementâ��s history in Britain and its relationship to the concept of avant-gardism.Â  It presents Britainâ��s contribution towards the movement and an account about an aspect of Britainâ��s own literary history which has otherwise remained neglected.Â  This account of the Concrete poetry movement in Britain is presented through the concept of the avant-garde, meaning an arts movement which challenges cultural and social tradition.Â  The primary research question of the thesis is: in what way did the Concrete poetry movement behave as an avant-garde?Â  The thesis argues that the Concrete poetry movement in Britain was a post-modern avant-garde through its existence as a decentred group and through the way that its poetry was formally innovative; a challenge to the realist convention of the author; and on the side of libertarian politics.

Four key questions are asked of social movements.Â  Do they: create a legitimate and representative channel for the articulation of interests; monitor government actions and improve government responsiveness; foster political institutionalisation by engaging with or contesting political institutions and lastly minimise inequality and assist in sustainable economic reform? These questions are answered through detailed empirical research with two contemporary social movements, the Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee and farm workerâ��s union Sikhula Sonke. The thesis finds that post-apartheid social movements strengthen democracy where they empower citizens, create opportunities for members to express their interests and vocally hold the government to account, particularly around service delivery.Â  Movements have been less successful, however, in fostering political institutionalisation and in minimising economic inequality.Â  Social movement activity that has alienated decision-makers, reduced opportunities for citizen participation and employed sustained illegal strategies has in practice weakened democracy.Â  Nonetheless, this thesis argues that, in aggregate, post-apartheid social movements do strengthen South Africaâ��s nascent democracy.Â  If democracy is to be further deepened, however, it must be re-crafted to address socio-economic inequality.",899725099,,Dissertations & Theses," White, Fiona MaryWhiteMaryFionaWhite, Fiona Mary",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491196201 , 65047731 , 101309 , U519494 , U519494", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899725099?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," 498016 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Strengthening+democracy%3A+the+role+of+social+movements+as+agents+of+civil+society+in+post-apartheid+south+africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=White%2C+Fiona+Mary&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"213,"From the text to the frame: a frame analysis of the collective action frames of the zapatista army of national liberation, 1980-1998","Despite the wealth of interest in South Mexico’s Ejercito Zapatista Liberacion Nacional (EZLN), few studies have attempted to deconstruct the discourse of the Zapatistas according to its component parts. Most scholars have so far addressed the Zapatistas from the standpoint of political theory, international relations or anthropology, and in so doing have tended to engage primarily with broader polemical agendas. Furthermore, in their determination to typologise the Zapatistas as ‘this’ or ‘that’ sort of movement, scholars have overlooked the nuances and shades of meaning that exist within the Zapatista discourse, as well as the evolution of those meanings over time. As a result, the content and ongoing construction of the Zapatistas’ message has been eclipsed by a more encompassing, contested, and ultimately chimeric quest to reify the movement’s ‘essence’ or ‘truth’. This thesis represents an empirical analysis of the EZLN’s collective discourse that focuses on the content and constructed nature of their collective action frames. Combining three strands of social movement frame analysis, it avers to draw-out the ever-changing detail of the EZLN’s discursive output and so add value to the debates that surround the Zapatistas.

I will conduct this analysis utilizing two country case studies: that of Turkey and Pakistan, each within the context of the theoretical frameworks of Karl Marx, Max Weber and Emile Durkheim and their study of the impact of religious ideas upon economic structures. In the last 30 years, from the start of market Neoliberalism, the political economy has shaped religious ideas in Muslim-populated regions as a result of privatization, deregulation of the market and urbanization. I found this process similar to that of the industrialization and emergence of modern capitalism in the beginning of 19th century Europe, which produced rapid urbanization. This, in turn, created a different lifestyle, family structure and (most importantly) produced a unique and secularized individual that was and is a product of modernity. The process can also be described as a departure from tradition and God. Economic transformations of this period restructured the concept of social and politics. The politics of God have been replaced by the politics of economy. On the other side, neoliberal economic policies have instigated a desecularization process within Muslim-populated countries. In Turkey, privatization and deregulation of the market have actually helped Muslims and Political Islam to move upward in the social stratification ladder and the result is the emergence of an Islamic-oriented middle class. The Gulen movement in Turkey is one of the best examples of this process. In Pakistan, the Jama'at-e-Islami has been a key player in the political and social sphere and has been supported by the middle class since the country was established in 1947. However, the polarization of Pakistani politics has weakened Jama'at and has consequently led to the formation of even more religious groups and movements. Both countries have in common similar social, political and economic characteristics and the desecularization process is taking place rapidly. In my research, I will compare the Fethullah Gulen Movement and the Jama'at in the context of the strengthening Neoliberalist economic process, and will look at how and why economic policies have created and led to a desecularization of the social and political spheres, unlike the case of 19th century Europe. According to this research, desecularization in Muslim populated societies is a temporal process, which represents the larger social and political patterns of transformation that have been fueled by the market economy. Although we do witness an increasing trend of Islamization in Pakistan and Turkey, these movements will in time become weakened and absorbed by new market conditions. In the Turkish case, the Gulen Movement has already been integrated into the market economy and should be understood as a market oriented movement rather than an Islamic-based Nurcu movement. This is because in the Gulen Movement, establishing an Islamic order is not the primary objective, but the movement instead seeks political power as well as economic prosperity. I therefore describe the Gulen Movement as an 'Islamic movement without Islam.' On the other hand, The Jama'at in Pakistan represents a persisting form of classical Islam, which conflicts with and directly opposes the market conditions. However, powerful economic forces have transformed the Jama'at-e- Islami of Pakistan from a classical form of Islam to a more reactionary form of Islam. I argue that both the Gulen Movement in Turkey and the Jama'at in Pakistan will be domesticated by powerful market forces; however, this change will occur over the longer term. In this global era, there will continue to be less space for traditional community, and instead, market-based-individualism will play a dominant role in social relations. I contend that Islam will not be able to escape from this domestication process.",1031215626,,Dissertations & Theses," Keskin, TugrulKeskinTugrulKeskin, Tugrul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2729577621 , 70993592 , 66569 , DP19775 , DP19775", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1031215626?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science",," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," Social research , Political science"," Social sciences , Capitalism , Neoliberalization , Pakistan , Secularism , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Comparative+Analysis+of+Islamist+Movements+in+the+Neoliberalization+Process%3A+Jama%E2%80%99at-e-+Islami+in+Pakistan+and+the+Fethullah+Gulen+Movement+in+Turkey+%E2%80%93+Reactions+to+Capitalism%2C+Modernity+and+Secularism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Keskin%2C+Tugrul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"215,The Cyber Left: Indymedia and the making of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century struggle,"Provoked by transformations in global capitalism and the ""information age,"" in the past decade we have witnessed the emergence of a new form of social movement, which has taken the shape of a globalized, digitized, radically democratic network formation. In preparation for the 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) meetings in Seattle, activists launched the first independent media center (IMC), a physical and virtual space for the creation and distribution of grassroots journalism. The cornerstone of Seattle's IMC was an open publishing Web platform that offered new ways to speak and be heard, and new channels to coordinate a global movement. Seattle's IMC model captured the imagination of activists, journalists and citizens leading to the development of IMCs worldwide and the birth of the indymedia movement. Today, indymedia claims over 200 locally based collectives publishing news (Internet, radio, print and TV) in 30 languages on six continents—making it the largest alternative communications infrastructure in the world. This transnational, networked social formation brings into focus a complex age where the local and global are increasingly entwined in novel ways and the informational tools of global capitalism are reappropriated to connect an emergent ""globalization from below."" Based on these spatial, strategic and organizational shifts, I argue that indymedia is exemplar of a new stage in social movements, which I call the Cyber Left. Through this study, I analyze the way communication tools have shifted spatial and temporal configurations within movements, creating new possibilities for organizational structure, democratic governance and a ""post-identity politics"" strategy. The study also sheds light on the way technology and the increasingly trans-bordered flow of people, capital, and resistance transforms seemingly stable notions of the state, citizenship, and social class. In my research I look at the Philadelphia node of Indymedia (one of the first and most successful) as it intersects with local, national and global expressions of the network. My fieldwork involved both traditional and virtual ethnographic methods to grapple with the fluid nature of political structures and cultural forms which, tied to new technologies, are at once situated locally while traveling globally.",1314439276,,Dissertations & Theses," Wolfson, ToddWolfsonToddWolfson, Todd",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907163011 , 47794591 , 66569 , 9781267950765 , 3536592 , 3536592", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781267950765, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314439276?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0708 Mass communications"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0708 Mass communications"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0708 Mass communications",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0708 Mass communications"," Cultural anthropology , Journalism , Mass communications"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Democracy , Independent media , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Cyber+Left%3A++Indymedia+and+the+making+of+21st+century+struggle&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wolfson%2C+Todd&amp;isbn=9781267950765&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"216,An investigaiton into the nature of the global justice movement: the rise of a new political mobilisation of resistance?,"The last quarter of the twentieth century was marked by the expansion of neo-liberal globalisation.  The key advocates for this policy agenda have been: the World Bank, the IMF, the WTO and TNCs.  This process has had a social and environmental impact worldwide on factors including: human rights, social exclusion and environmental degradation.  This impact has prompted resistance on a global scale, marking the birth of a contemporary form of social movement that has been termed the global justice movement by some scholars.  The research investigates the ways this new movement entity is materialising itself and its political mobilisation of resistance.  A qualitative approach to data gathering is adopted, whereby 12 social movement organisations (SMOs) struggling for global justice in Britain, Italy, Brazil and Thailand are taken as case studies.  The fieldwork consisted of semi-structured interviews and participant observation, with the latter being carried out during the 2003 and 2005 World Social Forums; the 2002 and 2004 European social Forums; and the 2005 street protests in Scotland against the G8 meeting. It emerged from the empirical data that there are substantial differencees between the Northern and the Southern SMOs, regarding the nature of their struggles and processes of mobilisation.  With reference to political activism the research outcomes show that although it can transcend national borders, collective action itself is fundamentally locally rooted.  Moreover, access to resources plays an important role in whether transnational activism occurs and this is easier for Northern SMO suppliers.  Further evidence revealed that the organisations are developing computer aided networks; however, almost all those interviewed consider the Internet as just one of the media for galvanising their movement.  Vis-à-vis the GJM, the SMOs research all conceded that there is a global justice movement, but expressed substantially different views as well as some commonalities on its nature and function.",1314573662,,Dissertations & Theses," De Oliveira, Khris MattarDe OliveiraMattarKhrisDe Oliveira, Khris Mattar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907875441 , 65056741 , 101309 , U556941 , U556941", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314573662?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," 518097 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+investigaiton+into+the+nature+of+the+global+justice+movement%3A+the+rise+of+a+new+political+mobilisation+of+resistance%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=De+Oliveira%2C+Khris+Mattar&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"217,"The british fair trade movement, 1960-2000: a new form of global citizenship?","This thesis is concerned with the development of a Fair Trade social movement in Britain between 1960 – 2000. It situates the analysis of Fair Trade within the context of historical debates about political consumption. It examines the role of the ethical consumer as a political activist and questions whether Fair Trade has led to a new understanding of the meaning of global citizenship. It is argued that contemporary questions about the limitations of Fair Trade as a model for international development should be grounded in an informed understanding of the intellectual and applied origins of the movement. Revisiting the origins of Fair Trade is not only an important academic exercise but provides the movement with an opportunity to reassess its core values. The intellectual origins of the movement are considered with reference to the nineteenth century thinkers and consumer campaigns. Although building on the politics of the past, the messages and organisational structure of Fair Trade represented a new and distinctly modern approach to campaigning more closely aligned with the ‘new social movements’ than traditional labour or consumer politics.

The formulation of transnationalism has not been uncontested and its boundaries are still subject to redefinition. The studies that have utilised transnational frameworks have primarily centred upon circuits of movement flowing through North America. Although the volume of literature countering this focus has steadily increased there are few studies of transnationalism which apply to the migrations emerging from the spaces of the Former Soviet Union. Further, within post-Soviet studies the body of literature questioning the appropriateness of applying frameworks of western derivation to post-Soviet realities has grown steadily. This study applies transnational concepts to a post-Soviet context. This thesis comprises a case study of the migratory practice of Russian German respondents interviewed in Russia and Germany. The empirical findings are employed to problematise understandings of transnationalism within a post-Soviet rubric. I argue that although Russian Germans’ participation in transnational circuits is constrained by local circumstance in both Russia and Germany, study respondents are a part of a Russian German transnational community nonetheless. Their transnationalism is understood in terms of social space, hybridity and culture.",1774212360,,Dissertations & Theses," Mamattah, SophieMamattahSophieMamattah, Sophie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989188921 , 102695872 , 101309 , 10031150 , 10031150 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1203/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774212360?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1203/ , (UMI)AAI10031150 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Russian+german+identity%3A+transnationalism+negotiated+through+culture%2C+the+hybrid+and+the+spatial&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mamattah%2C+Sophie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"219,"Constructing global civil society from below: a case study of learning global citizenship in the save the narmada movement, india","The thesis examines the informal learning of global citizenship in the course of social struggle within grassroots movements, through an ethnographic case study of the Save the Narmada Movement (NBA). The movment, comprising village communities in India, campaigned with the support of international non-governmental organisations to prevent the construction of a World Bank (WB) financed dam. The study arises in response to a perceived marginalisation of grassroots resistances, especially in developing contexts, within empirical accounts of global civil society (GCS), which is conceptualised as a space where 'global citizens' seek to resist and transform the exigencies of economic globalisation. Interrogating the validity of this exclusion, a Gramscian framework is adopted to examine whether, and in what ways grassroots actors are global citizens, engaged in the transformative politics of GCS. Analysis of data emerging from NBA suggests that contestation with political structures at the national (Indian government) and global (WB) level is an important source of learning that leads to the construction of a movement's global citizenship. Through a Gramscian dialectical process of strategic action and reflection, the movement developed a critical awareness of the class character of these institutions, leading NBA to connect its local struggle against the dam to wider struggle against `destructive development and globalisation. This process encouraged a revalorisation of grassroots participants' subjective relationships to the nation-state, leading amongst some, to the rejection of national citizenship in favour of global affiliations. Articulation of global citizenship was based on a counter-hegemonic identification with struggles of the oppressed across the world, rather than a depoliticised 'moral universalism'. However, learning to extend global citizenship to challenging oppression embedded within movement communities is constrained in a context where unity against external oppressors is paramount. By examining the learning processes that led NBA to articulate and perform global citizenship in empowering ways, the thesis points to how grassroots movements are constructing GCS, and therefore contests their current marginalisation within GCS perspectives.",1779537415,,Dissertations & Theses," Shukla, NatashaShuklaNatashaShukla, Natasha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015124441 , 102696032 , 101309 , 10081168 , 10081168 , http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/19925/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779537415?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/19925/ , (UMI)AAI10081168 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+global+civil+society+from+below%3A+a+case+study+of+learning+global+citizenship+in+the+save+the+narmada+movement%2C+india&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shukla%2C+Natasha&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"220,Study on the effect of international short-term capital flows in china,"Translation from original language as provided by author Nowadays with the obvious trend of economic globalization, international capital flows, especially international short-term capital flows, have aroused general concern all over the world. International experience shows that the introduction of international capital has become an essential force to promote the development of host country's economy. However, with the influence of various factors, the frequently movements of international short-term capital flows exert a large impact on a country's economy. Even more serious it also can trigger financial and social crisis under certain conditions. With the acceleration of the opening process in the realm of finance and the relaxation of capital control in our country, the volume of short-term capital flows is increasing sharply. And its frequently movements have exerted a significant impact on our economy. Form macroeconomic perspective, financial markets and systems perspective, this paper aims to analyze the influence of the short-term capital flows on our economy.This paper is composed of five parts. In the first part is the introduction. It illustrates the background of the research, the significance of the research, as well as the research method and arrangement. It also summarizes the results of domestic and international research concerning how international short-term capital flow influences our economy. The second part analyzes the characteristics of international short-term capital flow in our country, including the discussion of the channel and the measure of the scale. The third part is the most important part. Through the method of theoretic analysis combined with empirical analysis, it elaborates the effects of the short-term capital flows on our macroeconomic, financial markets and systems. In the fourth part, it analyzes the practices of the domestic and international short-term capital flows supervision. And then it comes up with some positive suggestions to lower the adverse effects to our economy executed by international short-term capital flows. Conclusions and implications are given in the last section. In recent years, international short-term capital flows promotes the growth of our economy in large. However, the shock on financial market and system can not be ignored. We should accelerate the reform of financial system and establish a supervisory system to regulate the international short-term capital flows",1868032411,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, Yan YanWuYanYanWu, Yan Yan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313656211 , 70608092 , 189128 , 10406659 , 10406659", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868032411?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAI10406659 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+the+effect+of+international+short-term+capital+flows+in+china&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Yan+Yan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"221,Study on china's oil trade problems,"Translation from original language as provided by author As a kind of non-renewable resources, oil is an important strategic resource for the development of national economy. At the same time, oil is the most international trade commodity, and international oil trade has more and more influences on the world economy as well. The transnational and trans-region's oil flows increase, developing to the global market. Oil international trade is closely related to the world economy and the political situation, particularly world market supply and demand and the international price situation. It is enormously influenced by various factors, such as economy, politics, the military and the social culture etc.As a developing country and a large energy-consuming nation, China's oil demand grows rapidly with the development of economy. But domestic oil production and supply cannot meet the oil demand brought by industrialization, urbanization and population growth, the oil import volume and the foreign degree of dependency increases yearly. China's fast development in globalization is supported by safely and stable oil resource without doubt. Therefore, we must analyze our oil foreign trade on the aspect of strategy and formulate more feasible policies and measures according to the existing problems in oil trade.This thesis is divided into five parts. The first part expounds the study purpose and significance, research situation in and abroad of China, idea and innovation of this article. The second part analyses the production and consumption, price movements and trade status of the world oil. The third part introduces the process and specialty of China's oil trade.

The author holds that instead of a pure Islamic reviving movement or a simple sectarian struggle, Islamic Fundamentalism is a current of thought, a movement, and a social phenomenon that contains implications of many aspects. It is an Islamic movement of all Islamic political factions (extreme school, moderate school) that taking religion as a weapon, aims to achieve the political goal of seizing power, establishing an Islamic state, and opposing hegemonies in different ways. Extreme fundamentalism is an important cause for the rampancy of international terrorism.This thesis mainly elaborates the causes and manifestations of the forceful rising of Islamic Fundamentalism in Islamic world. Concerning the complex causes, the author holds that not only domestic factors of some Islamic countries account, but also the success of ""Islamic revolution"" in Iran is related. We should not neglect the influence of the hegemony contending between America and Soviet Union and the drastic changes in Eastern Europe either.This thesis explores the great influence of the rising and development of Islamic Fundamentalism through various aspects. It states that this movement involves every field of social life, such as politics, economy, and culture of the Middle East and even the whole world. The eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, the conflict between Arab countries and Israel, and the world-wide rampancy of international terrorism are all related to. Though its negative effect is great, it still has the function of opposing hegemony through this unity.This thesis explores the impact the rising and development of Islamic Fundamentalism has on China; and points out that it has seriously negative impact on the economic security and border security in China, and other political forces outside China. Therefore, this paper puts forward corresponding suggestions: seeking both temporary and permanent solutions and international joint efforts are the very basic ways. As for China, the proper choices should be: to speed up economic construction, to maintain stability of the north-west frontier, to improve school management, to strictly prevent the interference of religion in education, to make better work relating to ethnic minorities, to promote the unity of all ethnic groups, to intensify the efforts to combat international terrorism through international unity and cooperation, to speed up religious legislation, and",1868036038,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, ChanLiChanLi, Chan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313667161 , 70609002 , 189128 , 10406377 , 10406377", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868036038?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10406377 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+into+the+contemporary+revival+and+impact+of+islamic+fundamentalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Chan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"223,Study on women's aid work in war of deng yingchao in anti-japanese war,"Translation from original language as provided by author Deng Yingchao (1904-1992),born in Nanning of Guangxi,originally from Guangshan of Henan,is an outstanding proletariat revolutionist and great politician of China,is a famous social activist and faithful Marxist of CPC,is a pioneer and brilliant leader of the Chinese Women's liberation movement and the international progress women movement.In her early days,Deng Yingchao actively devoted herself to the Chinese Women's liberation movement and laid a solid foundation to direct women to take part in the Anti-Japanese War.

After the Cold War, people have more expectations of the world's development problems and the solution of North-South gap. The North-South gap is the gap between the developed capitalist countries and the underdeveloped capitalist countries. The North-South gap is a comprehensive gap. It includes economic, political, social, cultural and military gap. Since the South countries entered the capitalist world system, it resulted in the North-South gap. Aafter independence,the poor and backward situation of the South countries has been no radically changed. Economic development of the world is materially unbalanced, and the North-South gap is further widening. The developing countries have gained less from the economic globalization process, and some of them are in danger of being marginalized. Although the international community has talked for years about the need to settle the North-South question, the gap between countries in the two hemispheresis not narrowing but constantly widening.The South countries have always been faced with the task of safeguarding national sovereignty and developing national economy. In the international arena, the South countries need to oppose hegemonism and change the old international order. It is a long-term process to narrow and eradicate the North-South gap. The question of North-South gap has aroused extensive concern in the international community. After the Cold War, with the development of globalization, many international issues emerged. These international issues include environmental pollution, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, ethnic and religious conflicts, the energy crisis and so on. These international issues are threatening human survival and development. These problems have deep ties to the issue of the North-South gap. The international community recognized that the North-South gap is an important factor of instability. Poverty leads to environmental degradation, armed conflict, and even the spread of terrorism. It undermines the interests of all countries. After the Cold War, the world socialist movement was at a low ebb.To study the question has profound theoretical and practical significance.

It was the most radical revolution organization of Taiwan. Under the help of the Communist International, Communist Party of Japan and Communist Party of China, The TCP was founded in shanghai on April 15, 1928. Later it came to Taiwan, and attracted the Taiwan Culture Association and Taiwan Peasant's Organization. Unfortunately, the TCP was destroyed by colonial police of Japanese on June of 1931, which caused the vacuum time of Taiwan national movement. The TCP was not mature. As a national branch of the Japanese Communist Party, It was the result of the communist international pushing forward the world revolution. After the rebuilt of TCP, the readers had different opinion about the revolution circumstances as a result of the impact of the Communist International, there was a debate between Xie xuehong who insisted the confederative route and Wang wande who insisted the class conflict, but the substance of their contest was about revolution route and tactics not the factional. They fought for leadership and control of TCP, which caused the fission of the external organizations. It was not good for the development of Taiwan national movement, and also made TCP be in trouble. The TCP lacked the social foundation and the leaders were not enough mature, which were the fundamental cause of TCP's defeat. Although the time of TCP was only 3 years, it had the important meaning to Taiwan people opposing the imperialism and colonialism. The meaning of ""the national independence of Taiwan"" mentioned by TCP's party platform is letting Taiwan be independent from the colonialism of Japan. As one of the central leaders of TCP, Xie xuehong who be trained by the Communist International bended herself to the career of Taiwan's liberation from Japan not Taiwan's independence from china.

More and more companies aware that they should morally obliged to give something back to society. An entity that fails to make a positive contribution to society will be perceived as being socially irresponsible. Some companies believe that being seen as socially responsible will bring them a competitive advantage, allowing them to achieve better economic results. In order to demonstrate that they care about the people and environment they operate in, organizations are using the Social Responsibility Reporting to disclosure their social activity information, so that to built the company's reputation in the society and obtain competitive advantages that can differentiate from its competitors. Since then the Corporate Social Responsibility movement in our country reached its climax. ""Shenzhen Stock Exchange Guidelines on corporate social responsibility"" issued in 2006, and then the State Assets Management Committee regulated the report of social responsibility of the state-owned enterprises. However, the social responsibility reporting in our country is still in its infancy. Many companies don't have strong conscious about the social responsibility; the information disclosure is belonged to voluntary behavior. It is optional for the reporting contents and the information tend to use the non-financial words to describe, the shortage of financial data may lead the report not comparability and the report users could not find the useful information in reports. It's not good for stakeholders in decision-making.

According to the investigation result of the international reports on social responsibility, author used the Nation Top 100 companies in China as sample. The sample consisted by ""social responsibility report"" or ""sustainability report"" issued for 2007. The study looks at corporate social responsibility reports of different companies across different industries. we statistical these reports from different aspects, such as the reporting period, industry distribution, reference standards used and so on. We noted that there still not many companies in top 100 issued the social responsibility reports. Among these issued organizations, most of them are state-owned. After that we analysis the information disclosure situations about these social responsibility reports, almost all of these reports contains four main perspectives, which are environment, community, marketplace and workplace. But these contents quality and quantity are still not perfect; most of the information disclosures are formalization, they only used vague sentences to describe their responsibility about economic, society and environment, lack of substantive quantization evidence to support the information, and these reports quality influenced by this situation. So these reports' information disclosures should be regulated to improve their quality.In this situation, this study try to analysis the social information disclosure form the accounting point of view. On the profits from the actual situation in China, we propose some items to improve the CSR reporting information disclosure, in order to arouse the deeper discussion and interest so as to let this report play a substantial role for all of",1869025523,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, Si SiWuSiSiWu, Si Si",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314619461 , 111103532 , 189128 , 10314066 , 10314066", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869025523?accountid=14496, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting,, 0272 Accounting, Accounting," (UMI)AAI10314066 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+corporate+social+responsibility+reporting+information+disclosure------accounting-based+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Si+Si&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"230,Research on islamic radicalism of indonesia in post-suharto era,"Translation from original language as provided by author  At the end of the 20th century, the financial crisis had a significant impact on Indonesian: the Suharto regime collapsed during the crisis, Indonesia has entered a new process of political democratization.

Hence, the national separatism in southern Thailand is, in the last analysis, concerned with both the religion's internal factors and the Thai government's policy. Meanwhile we must note that it is greatly not enough for a single country to cope with its national separatism just on the domestic level. It should also pay attention to the attitude of its neighbor countries and the international macroenvironment.

The present research endeavors to combine the complexity study of social system and its new achievement in the area of productive forces and productive relations which are an important category in Historical Materialism to further this study: we mean to have a demonstration to the complex theoretical relationship of them; their manifestation of complexity in reality, and finally the complex demonstrations of this pair of Marxist category in actual society, and its instructive function to social development, management and social change. By implying Marxist, systematic and scientific method, contradictory analysis and by combing theory and practice, the present study carries its discussion around the fundamentals problem of ""the contradictory movement of productive forces and productive relations"". Chapter one clarifies and defines the basic concepts of productive forces and productive relations, and their place in the theory of Marxism; moreover, new problems existing in this study of the contradictory movement of productive forces and productive relations is to be presented. Chapter two is the heart of the dissertation.

There are mainly environmental pollution, counterfeiting, violations of employee benefits, tax evasion, lost faith etc. The primary cause of the factors small-to-medium-sized enterprises management lack of faith attributed to the enterprises themselves, corporate executives factors, the Government of factors and the system loss factor etc. Therefore, in the corporate social responsibility movement, most of our existing management model for small-to-medium-sized are being exposed all the flaws.

First of all, the writer reviews development history of the Taiwan NGOs. Between 1949 and the mid-1980s, under authoritarian rule ,almost all of the Taiwan NGOs were controlled by the authorities, without autonomy. It is the quality and quantity watershed of Taiwan NGOs during the later mid-1980s. The beneficial political circumstances stimulated and hastened its fast and full development. Taiwan NGOs not only grew rapidly in the number, but gained legal status and owned autonomy. In the second place, the writer summarizes and illustrates the Taiwan NGOs' international participation and its main ways to participate. Since 1990s, the international participation of Taiwan NGOs have take on a growing tendency in the quantity, the fields of activity and the international impact. At the end of 2007, Taiwan NGOs have joined 2162 INGOs and taken part in international activities in the area of humanitarian aid, medical care, education and humanism, charity, human rights, etc. There are four means through which Taiwan NGOs are engaged in the international community: Firstly, Taiwan NGOs provide humanitarian aid, social and economic development assistance indirectly. Secondly, they participate in international affairs in order to keep close contact with international organizations(IOs). Thirdly, they develop the overseas branches and job positions. Fourthly, they lead missions to other sovereign states and IOs to lobby. Then, the writer explores the characteristics of international participation of Taiwan NGOs. After the mid-1990s, Taiwan NGOs are invovled in international activity. In the process of international participation, the humanitarian aid, social and economic development assistance play a prominent role. Most important, Taiwan NGOs not only cooperate well with each other, but also keep interactive relationship with Taiwan authorities. In the third place, with the introduction of a core concept of political opportunity structures of social movement theory, the writer analyses the political opportunity structures which Taiwan authorities possess and reveal the root cause for international participation of Taiwan NGOs over the past decade by qualitative analysis. As the matter of fact, it is Taiwan authorities that constitute the political opportunity structures able to be utilized by Taiwan NGOs. Taiwan authorities possesss more inclusive political opportunity structures:Firstly, Taiwan authorities keep openness to NGOs. Secondly, Taiwan authorities are comprised of unstable political alliances. Taiwan authorities provide political opportunities of richer material resources, non-material resources and well-established institutional structure. The material resources refer to the subsidy and the funds supplied by Taiwan authorities, while the non-material resources refer to Taiwan authorities' supportive attitude toward NGOs. The well-established institutional structure includes two aspects: on the one hand, Taiwan authorities acknowledge NGOs' legal status; on the other hand, Taiwan authorities and NGOs have established liaison mechanisms. What's more, the writer takes two NGOs as the key examples, one is buddhist compassion relief Tzu Chi foundation which originated from the grass-roots and now is world-famous; the other is international cooperation and development foundation which is a GONGO virtually. With the two examples, the writer comes to the conclusion that the motivation for Taiwam NGOs continuous development and its international participation should be attributed to the political opportunity structures provided by Taiwan authorities. Finally, the writer holds that Taiwan NGOs' international participation is a sensitive issue in the cross-Straits relations. Solving this issue, there are three aspects as follows. First and foremost, adhere to the basic one-China principle consistently, and resist and prevent any Taiwan authorities' and ""Taiwan independence"" forces' separatism attempts and activities. Moreover, under the premise of the one-China principle, if the mainland and Taiwan find effective ways and means through negotiations, Taiwan may take part in the international community in the areas without dispute over sovereignty. Last but not least, the chinese mainland NGOs must enhance and expand their relationships with Taiwan NGOs and INGOs in order that produce positive effects on Taiwan NGOs' and further the international image of",1869955026,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, YinChenYinChen, Yin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315499491 , 111105062 , 189128 , 10536228 , 10536228", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869955026?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10536228 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+taiwan+ngos%27international+participation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Yin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"238,Study on capital network--based on evolution,"Translation from original language as provided by author In both practical and theoretical perspective, capital is a developing concept.

Based on the perspective of evolution, we can found that all forms of capital connected to be a capital network in the network economy. Capital network is a dissipative structure embedded in social networks. The unbalanced development of virtual capital network and physical capital netwok is the main force of evolution. capital network exchanges information, material and energy with social network to be a order system. In this article, the movement of capital network is the reason why ecological crisis and economic crisis happen. There are many studies on virtual capital network to be a complex system. on the basis of these article, I made a empirical analysis on domestic goods capital network,to show that this sub-system is a complex system.

Then we found that capital theory is evolving , it has different forms and ways of movement with the development of productivity and production relations.

It is a complex network embedded in and changing material, energy and infomation with the social network.

The capital have more conditions and motivation force to flow around the whole world because of the economic globalization, also because of which the Multinational Corporations have developed dramatically and earned profit from anywhere of the world. In this way, the overall fortune of the world can incessantly increase and the world economy has been booming, however, compared with the high interest of the Multinational Corporations, labor rights have been weakened and the labors benefit nothing from the economic globalization. The labor movement across the world and the ""anti-sweatshop movement"" push the labor problem to be in front of the people, which make international community aware of that we must effectively protect the laborers' rights and interests in order to promote to the sustaining and healthy development of globalization. The International Labor Standards that set by International Labor Organization which is the efforts made by human are not only the rules to protect the fundamental labor rights, but also considered as the trade barrier. The developed countries have been trying to put the International Labor Standards in to the WTO system, which is protested by the developing countries and caused controversy. It is introduced in this paper the related concepts and the main contents of the International Labor Standards in chapter one, then in the chapter two the process of the labor standard being related to trade policy and the controversy of it which author also try to defend.International Labor Standards can not beat the target in the protection of laborers' rights and interests since lacking guarantees in power of enforcements, however, the actions of the corporate social responsibility make up its deficiency. When the ideas of the corporate social responsibility spreads like a storm across the planet, the developing countries feel more and more pressures than before. Many corporations began to raise the labor standards and improve status of the labors. Author introduced the development of the CSR movement, and the content and substance of the Social Accountability8000 in the chapter three, then presented a qualitative of the movement of CSR that although there are controversy and criticism of it, the CSR have made positive impact on protection of laborers' rights and interests.The labor problem became an international problem in the back ground of the economic globalization, since which the protection of labor rights can't be achieved by any only country unless the cooperation and efforts by nations and regions. The protection of labor rights fit the concrete embodiment of human rights in the labor field, whose substance fits the common interests of both developed and developing countries. Author not only elaborated the reasons of international cooperation in protecting labor rights but also introduced some cooperation between international organizations, states and NGOs, and analyzes the influence of WTO on protection of labor right at last in the chapter four.

From the second chapter on, this paper analyses the 4 reasons which lead social democratic parties developing differently in Asia, Africa and Latin-American. The 4 reasons are religious and culture traditions, economic development and class structure, political development, and international factors. People in East Asia who are deeply influenced by the traditional Confucian culture, which is a secular one, worship authority figures. This culture conflicts with thoughts social democratic parties holds. Social democratic parties believe in ideological pluralism and humanism. Latin-America countries have historical links with European countries both racially and culturally. This precipitation is a good foundation for the development of social democratic parties in Latin-America region. The thoughts social democratic parties hold has something in comment with traditional culture of Africans in some aspects. The economic development patterns and classical structures have great influence with the development of social democratic parties in Asia, Africa and Latin-America region. After the Second World War, governments led the economic development in East Asia, suppressed the labor movement, depoliticize the interest groups. All this constrained the development of social democratic parties in Asia. The overly nationalization in Africa countries soon after they got independent and neo-liberalism reform subsequently, all produced tremendous social and economical problems. Democratic socialism is worth trying as a guiding ideology for Africa countries which want both to root out poverty and to develop efficiently. Suffering from both underdevelopment and development of capitalism, a great many people in Latin-America accept the political thoughts which claim to take the third way. As the pioneer who claims to take the third way, the social democratic parties are popular in this region. Besides, political democratization and international factor are also important factors to influence the development of social democratic parties in Asia, Africa and Latin-America regions.

Chinese-Japanese national contradiction became the principal one in the society. On the same basis of resistance against Japanese aggression, the KMT (Kuomintang)and CCP(Chinese Communist Party) formed the anti-Japanese national united front. Thus, the history mission of Chinese nation changed. To adapt to the change, the primary tasks of Chinese Women's movements altered accordingly. Facing the crisis of Chinese national survival, the Chinese women suffered humiliation and insults, and were plunged to the abyss of unprecedented misery by Japanese imperialist aggression. To save the Chinese nation and seek their own liberation in society and family, Chinese women and all the people together, put up the most arduous and bitter struggle and pushed the women's liberation movement, the movement promoted the awakening of Chinese women. They helped and supported the movements of anti-Japanese aggression and became one of the most important parts of it. Women's liberation and national democratic revolution for Chinese national survival form the surging tide of women's anti-Japanese movement. This thesis consists of three parts, and elaborates the author's views on the Chinese Women's movements during the full-scale Anti-Japanese War. The first part of it is a organizing in the women's movement during the period. This thesis analyzes the causes of rising of women's movements and their high national consciousness, striving for national salvation and patriotism. Chinese women supported the anti-Japanese war stopping out of families, schools and all kinds of posts. They founded various anti-Japanese organizations and opened up a new prospect. At that time, however, they were inclined to launch movements spontaneously and respectively. Because they were from different political parties, classes and association, the influential leaders and representatives had their own anti-Japanese ideas and attitudes without the common programmes of struggle. Their movements had active effects and association, the influential leaders and representatives had their own anti-Japanese ideas and attitudes without the common programmes of struggle. Their movements had active effects on mobilizing and organizing Chinese women from all walks of life to resist against Japanese aggression, but the spontaneous and respective movements couldn't keep long. As a result, it's difficult to form the united anti-Japanese movement. It didn't keep abreast of the increasingly extending and continuously deepening movement of saving Chinese nation. Then forming anti-Japanese national united front in women's world must be carried out without delay. The second part of thesis expounds the launching of women's movements generally. First, the author depicts: With the guidance of the principle of women's movements at the beginning of anti-Japanese war, they formed the women anti-Japanese united front. Second, the author explains women's movements and their characteristic, historic significance during the period of anti-Japanese war, when the anti-Japanese united front has been formed by the KMT and CCP and they're great different in politics, economy, culture and society. Third, the author depicts that the Chinese anti-Japanese war and women's movements took an important turn after South Anhui Incident in 1941, ""April 3"" decision showed women clearly the way forward in the stage of difficult developments, meanwhile, Chinese women's movements gained the international assist. The third part of the thesis elaborates women's movements of social strata in the anti-Japanese war and the characteristics of movements, and evaluates their movements. First of all, Chinese women's liberation and national liberation and social liberation are consistent. Women's liberation makes women free the special feudal system , and protect their rights of employment. Only participating in managing the state shows the women's real liberation. Second, Chinese did a good job in providing rear services. At the same time, their being engaged in production ensured the supplies to the anti-Japanese war. Finally, Chinese communist party makes out standing contributions to women's movements. The author concludes: Women's liberation should keep abreast of the change of times. With the social development and advancement, women should improve their qualities and abilities, thus they can meet the need of social development; meanwhile, they should participate in managing the state further.

The revolt shocked the entire western world and had far-reaching influence on France and other western countries. Until now, it has still been a subject of intellectual and political discussion. The outbreak and escalation of the French May Revolt in 1968 had broad social-historical background, but it was undoubtedly related to the mentality of those involved. This thesis focuses on the analysis of the collective mentality and social psychology of major groups involved. The thesis argues that by analyzing changes of the mentality of groups and consequently the group behavior an understanding of the development of this movement can we achieved. This approach could also shed a light on why the De Gualle government could calm the public and quelled the revolt dramatically. This thesis is divided into four chapters, the first chapter discusses the background of the revolt, and the transition from students movement to political crisis. It argues that factors such as French cultural tradition of making revolution to achieve social change, social problems of the 1960s and students' resentment as well as the international influence all contributed to the outbreak of the mass revolt.

However, there are very few studies on the trade union's participation in the social security system, especially on how the trade union practically engaging in the social security system. The right of social security is important to workers, and is also a crucial part in the trade union's work. China chooses to develop the market economic, which means the choice of market competition and related rules. China is a large country and the economic situation is deferent from area to area, and the urban-rural dual structure is difficult to change in a short term, which in turn influence how the trade union enroll into the social security system. What is more, as a product of labor relationship, trade union should take on the responsibility of social security and safeguard workers' rights. Therefore, it makes sense to in-depth analyze how can the trade union participate in the work of social security, combine with the discussion of the special situation in China. The paper made a review on both international and domestic researches on trade union's participation in social security. And based on the development of social security in China, historically analyzed the status and functions of trade union in social security, especially in social insurance. In the early stage, trade union directly managed the social security system, but because of the Cultural Revolution and reform and opening up, trade union gradually step down in the management of social insurance. I analyzed the necessities of trade union's role and involvement from different aspects. First of all, trade union is the organization of workers, by nature it should protect workers' rights. And the right to social security is an important part in workers' rights, it is trade union's social responsibility to improve and protect workers' right to social security. The history of the development of trade union is the history that workers union together and fight for their own rights, including the right to social security. And the development of social security is closely related to the development of workers movement and trade union organizations. From both international and domestic perspectives, the trend of globalization, economic crisis, and the increase of labor disputes, all express a need that the trade union should play a role in maintaining harmonious labor relations and social stability. Take the trade union in Shanghai for example, as the development of market economic, trade union became ""marginalized"" in the work of social security. But as the trade union became active in establishing an labor relations adjustment mechanism in Shanghai, and providing assistance to staff, it effectively promoted the development of social security. This paper also emphasized the restrictions that in trade union's participation in the work of social security. The role and status of trade union's participation in social security should be legalized. Trade union should be more active in promoting the establishment of social security laws. And trade union's work method should be developed as society has been changed. All the restrictions mentioned above are due to the trade union's dependent to enterprises, lack of funding and weak in the legal status. Then I discussed how the trade union in Russian and Austrian involved in the management of social security system, I also made recommendations on how trade union can move forward and engage in the work of social security. The characteristics of this research lie in: discussed the social security issue from a trade union's perspective, which is an important member of social security partners, and historical analyzed the change of trade union's role and status in social security. And in depth analyzed why the trade union should participate in the work of social security.

In the 1980s, Latin American countries such as Ecuador and Peru began to enact significant ethnodevelopment policies, or social and development policies that take into account indigenous poverty and that do so with a focus on culture and self-management. Other Latin American countries with similarly large indigenous populations and high levels of indigenous poverty such as Guatemala, in contrast, continued during this time to ignore ethnicity in domestic development policies, as had been the region-wide trend in decades past. Further adding to this puzzling variation, while Ecuador began immediately to implement these policies on the ground, in Peru, the strong policy paradigm was not translated into services and programs as promised in the law. Drawing from elite interviews and extensive analysis of each country's legal and organizational literature, among other sources, I find that the most common explanations for the appearance of multicultural policies, such as those looking to levels of racism and international pressure, cannot explain this empirical puzzle. Rather, I find that distinctive patterns of domestic political competition and social mobilization best make sense of the three countries' ethnodevelopment policy records. Specifically, policy-makers unattached to core constituencies with interests and ideologies in opposition to any part of the ethnodevelopment paradigm were in the best position to reach out to the uncaptured constituency represented by indigenous communities. In Latin American countries, center-left presidents have thus been uniquely situated to use ethnodevelopment policy-making to appeal to indigenous voters when tight competition provides incentives for new sources of support. Only in Ecuador and Peru did center-left presidents take power during the period under study, and therefore only in these two countries was the paradigm introduced. In Guatemala, where no center-left president was elected, no ethnodevelopment paradigm took shape. With the first policies placed on the legislative agenda in Ecuador and Peru by presidents of the center-left, formerly marginalized groups became perceived as a constituency based on ethnicity, rather than simply as a larger part of the general peasantry, poor or other class-based grouping. Now in “play,” political actors in these two countries perceived the targeted ethnic groups as a possible voting bloc and one to be fought over when tight competition necessitated such action. Having seen benefits accrued by the center-left, other presidents from along the political spectrum thus helped to continue building the ethnodevelopment paradigm when in need of new sources of support. The strength and presence of indigenous social movements best explains the variation in ethnodevelopment policy implementation levels in Ecuador and Peru. Specifically, both their early presence in pushing for multicultural policy as well as their links to local communities meant that indigenous social movements in Ecuador were in a beneficial position to see that implementation was carried out. The lack of such mobilization in Peru meant that the strong legislation that passed stayed “on the books,” and off the ground. This dissertation represents an original endeavor to explore a practically important empirical phenomenon that is insufficiently explained by the extant academic and policy literature. The broader argument put forth here not only makes sense of the particular empirical puzzle that motivates the study, but also shows evidence of traveling to other global contexts and policy-making situations. Thus, not only does the dissertation have important practical implications, but the findings here also contribute to the broader study of ethnic politics, policy-making, social movements and political parties.",220001086,,Dissertations & Theses," Chartock, SarahChartockSarahChartock, Sarah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1642934581 , 41871131 , 66569 , 9780549932598 , 3338673 , 3338673", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780549932598, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/220001086?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Political science , Ethnic studies , Competition , Minority & ethnic groups , Latin America , Ecuador , Peru , Guatemala"," Social sciences , Development with identity , Ecuador , Ethnodevelopment , Guatemala , Indigenous , Indigenous peoples , Latin American politics , Participatory policy , Peru , Political competition , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ethnodevelopment+in+Latin+America%3A+Political+competition+and+the+making+of+ethnically-targeted+participatory+policy+in+Ecuador%2C+Peru+and+Guatemala%2C+1985%E2%80%932005&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chartock%2C+Sarah&amp;isbn=9780549932598&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"251,"Women's theologies, women's pedagogies: Liberating praxes of Latin American women educators in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Argentina","In this dissertation, through semi-structured interviews with 36 female social movement participants and 3 male participants in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Argentina, I ask, How do women in Latin American social movements perceive the influence of theology on these movements' pedagogies? I argue that through this work, the women cultivate what I deem individual theologies rooted in their understanding of their own reality. Collectively, this creates an ecumenical ""theology of struggle."" These interviews allowed me to investigate the connection of women to social movements, the connection of women to theology, and the possibility for educational change through social movements rooted in theology. In doing so, I bring to the field of Comparative and International Education a sociology of theology. In order to understand the participants' realities and responses, the intersections between the frameworks of Theology of Liberation, Pedagogy of Liberation, Social Movements, and Neoliberal Globalization must be understood. These intersections are rooted in developments in theology and the social sciences in Latin America and Europe, as well as in the United States, Africa, and Asia. Additionally, I rethink conceptualizations of education and religion, spirituality, and faith. Narrative inquiry and Participatory Action Research theory are employed as methodological strategies. I conclude that in this development work, the women have shown that theology is both a tool of analysis and a tool of action to address race and ethnic, class, and gender inequality. Ultimately, I argue that the women perceive, as in the central research question, the influence of theology on their movements' pedagogies as an influence that leads to the women's liberation. This concept of liberation motivates women to participate in the struggle against neoliberal globalization through nonformal and formal education that contributes, ultimately, to holistic community development.",275674976,,Dissertations & Theses," Jones, Lauren IlaJonesIlaLaurenJones, Lauren Ila",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1997721761 , 46600561 , 66569 , 9781109686944 , 3401751 , 3401751", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109686944, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275674976?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0516 Adult education , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0516 Adult education , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0516 Adult education , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0516 Adult education , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Educational sociology , Womens studies , Adult education , Latin American Studies , Theology , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Argentina"," Education , Social sciences , Argentina , Bolivia , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Women educators",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women%27s+theologies%2C+women%27s+pedagogies%3A++Liberating+praxes+of+Latin+American+women+educators+in+El+Salvador%2C+Nicaragua%2C+Bolivia%2C+and+Argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Lauren+Ila&amp;isbn=9781109686944&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"252,"Making sense of anarchism: The experiments with revolution of Errico Malatesta, Italian exile in London, 1889–1900","This thesis analyzes the activity and writings of the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta in the period 1889-1900, during his residence in London, the headquarters of continental anarchism. Malatesta's thought and action allows us to study the organization and tactics of a significant segment of Italian and international anarchism. The key concern of the thesis is the rationality of anarchism, defined as coherence between desires, beliefs, and behaviour. I challenge not only the liberal and Marxist traditional historiographies of anarchism, but also more recent social history approaches. Each of these posits the irrationality of anarchism, cast as impossible aims, futile means, or absurd beliefs. In contrast, I regard rationality as a methodological principle of interpretation and a heuristic. By informing my account of Malatesta's anarchism with an explanatory ""principle of charity,"" I seek to illustrate and contest the historiographic pitfalls surrounding anarchism. In contrast to those historians who view unconcern for practical means, lack of organization, and spontaneism as standard features attributed to anarchism, I argue that the informal and opaque character of anarchist organization and the transnational dimension of the anarchist movement account for the sustainability of its action. I illustrate the continuity and change of Malatesta's tactics according to circumstances and experience and show the evolution of Malatesta's thought from an early anarchism inspired by the First International to a mature gradualist view. Through a critical comparison with twentieth century social science, I illustrate the coherence and sophistication of Malatesta's system of beliefs. Rather than being the endless repetition of necessarily doomed efforts, I conclude that Malatesta's theoretical and tactical evolution can be likened to the method of trial and error, whereby tentative solutions were put to the test of experience and revised accordingly. In this sense, Malatesta's efforts were his experiments with revolution.

I locate the dissertation in a feminist activist framework and draw from diverse data sources, including years of fieldwork with WLP (2004-2008); participant observation and notes from five transnational women’s rights meetings (2005-2008); a content analysis of a sample of international funders’ and MENA feminist NGOs’ websites; and two in-depth case studies with data derived from historical analysis, three months of fieldwork in Morocco, interviews with Moroccan, Lebanese, and regional activists, and secondary document analysis. The findings provide deeper clarity into the strategic action of MENA feminist movements and the variety of social, political, and economic forces that shape their discourses and practices for achieving social change and gender equality.

It is considered one of the main texts and though not read as much as some of the other more devotional texts or the more theological and philosophical texts, it nevertheless, stands out iconically as a key text for the movement and its followers. Śaiva Siddhānta is seen by many in Tamil Nadu, as a movement, which sometimes plays out in the discourse of the local Tamil culture, as an indigenous production. However, what is also of interest in this movement is its long relationship to pan-Indian movements and how it participates in these trans-local discourses. Here, I look at the role that the Tirumantiram plays in the production of these pan-Indian discourses, especially as they become localized in Tamil Nadu and how the text helps to bridge these two spheres—the local and global, as it gets co-opted into the local Tamil Śaiva Siddhānta movement. I also touch upon how this same text is used by a counter-cultural movement—the Tamil Cittar movement which, in opposition to the orthodox, high-caste Śaiva Siddhānta movement, uses this same very text but interprets it according to its own marginal discourse to make those same practices found in the text, available to a larger audience and set of practitioners. I do this by first looking at the Tirumantiram in a historical and social context as has been studied by some scholars. I then, give a brief synopsis of its contents by looking at the different sections and their contents. I follow this with an analyses of the ideas and practices found within the Tirumantiram by looking at them through a mainly Foucaultian enterprise, especially by using some of the ideas and methodologies Foucault developed when looking at ancient Greek and Roman cultures of the self, to look at how technologies of the self were used in order to construct meanings of subjectivity and relationships to truth. I do this by first looking at some of the general ideas found in the Tirumantiram and how they have been analyzed and explained through a corpus of commentarial productions. I then study some of the specific sections which deal with particular bodily and mental practices, in order to contextualize the discourses of Śaiva Siddhānta, especially the concepts of devotion and grace, and how they are embedded even within physical practices. I conclude that the Tirumantiram played and plays an important role in the formation of subjectivity and ethics in present day Tamil Nadu.",304835937,,Dissertations & Theses," Mena, Carlos NeyMenaNeyCarlosMena, Carlos Ney",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2042633471 , 52336031 , 66569 , 9781109750423 , 3402689 , 3402689", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109750423, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304835937?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Religious history , Religion , Philosophy , South Asian Studies , Exegesis & hermeneutics , Theology , Tamil Nadu India"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Cittar , Saiva Siddhanta , Siddhar , Tamil , Tirumantiram , Tirumular",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+hermeneutics+of+the+%E2%80%9CTirumantiram%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mena%2C+Carlos+Ney&amp;isbn=9781109750423&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"255,"The magic of words: Mexico, the dispute for the nation","Since the nineteen twenties, the Mexican State has imposed an economic, social and cultural project of the nation through the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). The state eliminated by decree racial differences, regional divergences, and gender distinctions. However, people contested and sought alternative political and cultural spaces to present their own national projects. Literature, as a symbolic zone, became one of the spaces where intellectuals disputed cultural codes of nationality. This work analyzes the dispute over the Mexican nation during two crucial historical moments: first, the student movement in Mexico City of 1968; and second, the indigenous rebellion of 1994 in the state of Chiapas lead by the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN). In the sixties, intellectuals prepared linguistic codes under the premise of ""revolutionary nationalism"", a concept drawn from the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In the nineties, the government abandoned this concept and instead, followed the premise of globalization. One example was the signing of international treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In contrast and in opposition to the government global project, the indigenous Zapatista movement followed the idea of cultural particularities. Thus this dissertation identifies how literature captures, through the narratives and discursive strategies used by intellectuals, the debate on the project of the nation. It analyzes two presidential reports, numerous essays and newspaper articles, and reveals the rhetorical discourse used by writers.",304844393,,Dissertations & Theses," Cardoso, JaimeCardosoJaimeCardoso, Jaime",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1953780091 , 50601301 , 66569 , 9781109570861 , 3391974 , 3391974", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109570861, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304844393?accountid=14496, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature,, 0312 Latin American literature, Latin American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Chiapas , Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional , Mexico , Nation , Student movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+magic+of+words%3A++Mexico%2C+the+dispute+for+the+nation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cardoso%2C+Jaime&amp;isbn=9781109570861&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"256,The spirits of the times: The Mexican spiritist movement from reform to revolution,"This is a study of the religious-philosophy of spiritism and its manifestation as a social movement in Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century.

Through an in-depth analysis of its history, beliefs, and practices, we will argue that Global Jihadism has taken on many of the same characteristics as other social movements of the 20 th century by, (1) Appealing to a set of familiar symbols (in this case, religious , rather than cultural or societal) to construct a collective identity that transcends all cultural, national, ethnic, and gender boundaries, with the aim of mobilizing individuals to rise up and effect radical social change. (2) Employing frame alignment techniques to create in-groups and out-groups (Protagonist Framing), to identify and vilify the enemy (Antagonist Framing), and to mark bystanders as either sympathetic or antagonistic to the movement (Audience Framing). (3) Framing legitimate grievances, which are named and connected to other grievances within a larger frame of meaning (a Master Frame), so as to communicate a uniform message to a large portion of the population. (4) Employing consensus mobilization techniques to identify a problem, assign blame, suggest solutions and remedies, and develop tactics and strategies for mobilization, all in an attempt to direct diverse values, interests, and ideas into collective action. By treating Global Jihadism as a social movement and noting the parallels between it and similar movements of the last century—all of which were replete with individuals who existed on the radical fringes of the political spectrum and all of which brought together a wide array of political views, ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and ideological causes under a master frame in which grievances were identified, blame assigned, solutions suggested, and participants mobilized—can we more effectively confront the security challenges posed by this little understood but much-feared ideology. The lesson to be learned from the rise and fall of the last century's social movements is that only when the movements' grievances were addressed and their specific concerns gradually “co-opted” into mainstream society, were the movements' members de-radicalized.",304852928,,Dissertations & Theses," Aslan, RezaAslanRezaAslan, Reza",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1919384711 , 49725741 , 66569 , 9781109511871 , 3385753 , 3385753", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109511871, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304852928?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0626 Sociology"," 0320 Religious history , 0626 Sociology"," 0320 Religious history , 0626 Sociology",," 0320 Religious history , 0626 Sociology"," Religious history , Sociology , Social change , War , Islamism , Theory"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Al-Qaeda , Jihadism , Social movements , War on Terror",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+Jihadism+as+a+transnational+social+movement%3A+A+theoretical+framework&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aslan%2C+Reza&amp;isbn=9781109511871&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"258,"Water for life, not for profit: Globalization, development, and water struggles in India","This dissertation is a multi-sited ethnography of environmental/anti-privatization water movements in three sites in India: New Delhi, Delhi; Mumbai, Maharashtra; and Plachimada, Kerala. The social movements are simultaneously environmental movements to ensure people’s access to water and anti-privatization movements against the private control of water supplies. The water struggles all began near the beginning of the twenty-first century (between 2002 and 2005) as responses to the World Bank and Indian government’s development strategy of foreign investments in public utilities (water) and private industry (the Coca-Cola Corporation). Two of my case studies concentrate on India’s largest cities, Delhi and Mumbai, where citizens opposed the government and Bank’s attempts to privatize the public water utilities. The other case study in the rural village of Plachimada, Kerala, investigates the people’s movement against the Coca-Cola Corporation because of its depletion and pollution of the community’s ground water. While the conflict in Delhi ended in 2005, the water movements in Mumbai and Plachimada are on-going. Through an in-depth analysis of these popular water struggles, I analyze the factors that contribute to resource movements, the links between them, and the different sites, actors, discourses, and dimensions of water conflicts. My research advances scholarship on Third World environmental movements and identifies the need for a new framework which I call the “new environmentalism.” This approach encourages researchers to consider the numerous layers of resource struggles such as the different actors, sites, interests, knowledge, values, and meanings within movements. I develop this paradigm using ethnographic evidence from eight months of field work in India and seventy in-depth interviews with: local residents, agricultural laborers, and farmers; anti-privatization activists and their pro-privatization opponents; government officials; employees of transnational corporations; community organizers; scholars; current and former Coca-Cola employees; and members of non-governmental organizations, trade unions, and women’s groups. My analysis is supplemented by an examination of movement literature and government and World Bank project documents on each of the proposed water projects. Throughout this dissertation I aim to explain why water conflicts occur and how we can prevent resource exploitation and engender new forms of sustainable water governance.",304853110,,Dissertations & Theses," Bywater, Krista AnneBywaterAnneKristaBywater, Krista Anne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1914155971 , 49725751 , 66569 , 9781109482812 , 3379445 , 3379445", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109482812, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304853110?accountid=14496," 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure",," 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," Public policy , Social structure"," Social sciences , Development , Envirornmental movements , Globalization , India , Resource conflicts , Third world environmentalism , Water privatization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Water+for+life%2C+not+for+profit%3A+Globalization%2C+development%2C+and+water+struggles+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bywater%2C+Krista+Anne&amp;isbn=9781109482812&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"259,"The circulation of transatlantic ideas and people in Cuban slave society, 1791-1844","This dissertation explores the circulation of people and ideas in Cuba during the Age of Revolutions. It analyzes how the mobility of political, anti-slavery, and abolitionist ideas, and the traffic of people who espoused these kinds of ideas, influenced Cuban colonial authorities' efforts at social control. Conversely, it also examines the impact these ideas had on free people of color and slaves in Cuba during the period 1791 to 1844, exploring the connection between ideologies of liberty, freedom, and equality and popular resistance. The central claim is that slaves and free people of color developed popular networks of communication and mobility that operated outside of the colonial government's scope of authority and challenged efforts at social control. As social spaces beyond the purview of authorities, these networks provided free blacks and slaves the opportunities to learn of and engage with transnational ideas. Moreover, people of African descent, slave and free, utilized their experiences of living in Cuban slave society to radicalize the transnational ideas they appropriated from the Atlantic world, including memories brought to the Caribbean by some African-born slaves. This project treats the movement of people and ideas as a serious subject of historical inquiry, tracing when, how, and under what conditions ideas reached slaves and free people of color, and uncovering points of contact between these subordinate groups and transatlantic ideas.",304853615,,Dissertations & Theses," Paul, Eric A.PaulA.EricPaul, Eric A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1917155531 , 49777851 , 66569 , 9781109487398 , 3379637 , 3379637", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109487398, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304853615?accountid=14496," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history"," Caribbean Studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Age of Revolutions , Atlantic world , Colonial Cuba , Cuba , Free people of color , Popular resistance , Slavery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+circulation+of+transatlantic+ideas+and+people+in+Cuban%0Aslave+society%2C+1791-1844&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paul%2C+Eric+A.&amp;isbn=9781109487398&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"260,"Beyond the Han River miracle: Soccer, soap operas, stem cells, and sanitation","My dissertation, Beyond the Han River Miracle: South Korean Soccer, Soap Operas, Stem Cells, and Sanitation , explores four interrelated phenomena through which Koreans are making outward -looking attempts to project South Korea as a “global” nation, a crucial marker of contemporary social identity for many South Koreans. I study variously positioned actors—bureaucrats, scientists, fans, and culture workers—and their endeavors to turn Korea into a new “cultural” power in order to make it relevant in a multi-polar world. My project builds upon work in Korean Studies and the anthropology of globalization, but takes this literature in a new direction by focusing on state and civil society-led initiatives to create, disseminate, and implement new definitions of Korean culture and society. Each chapter of my dissertation explores four self-consciously ""global"" projects in contemporary Korea. These are: (1) the “Better Korea Movement,” an organization instituted in order to “improve” South Korea before its hosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup; (2) the Korean Wave and the role of Arirang TV, a state-funded English-language global broadcasting station with the sole purpose of publicizing South Korea throughout the world; (3) a state-led biotechnology project in which the lead scientist was found to have fabricated his data; (4) and the World Toilet Association, an international NGO formed in Korea in 2007 to aid in the global efforts of improving sanitation through toilets. These sites are linked to national phenomena which produced massive social transformation, popular and governmental support, as well as civic unrest in South Korean society. Each sparked debates over national identity, South Korea’s place as an emerging nation in a globalizing world, and in particular, its status as a “modern” nation whose leaders and people have a real sense of impacting the whole of humanity.

This study focuses on the political argument—the rise of transnational anti-dam advocacy and its impact on state policy-making. Under what conditions does transnational anti-dam advocacy matter? Under what conditions does transnational advocacy change state dam policies (delay, scale down, or cancel)? It examines the role of transnational anti-dam actors in big dam building in a comparative context in Asia. Applying the social movement theory of political opportunity structure (POS) and using the qualitative case-study method, the study provides both within-case and cross-case analyses. Within-case analysis is utilized to explain the changing dynamics of big dam building in China (Three Gorges Dam and proposed Nu/Salween River dam projects), and to a lesser extent, Sardar Sarovar Project in India and Nam Theun 2 Dam in Laos. Different domestic and international POS (DPOS and IPOS) impact the strategies and outcomes of anti-dam advocacies in these countries. The degree of openness of the POS directly affects the capacity of transnational efforts in influencing state dam policies. The degree of openness or closure is measured by specific laws, institutions, discourse, or elite allies (or the absence of these) for the participation of non-state actors on big dam issues at a particular moment. This degree of openness is relative, varying over time, across countries and regions. This study finds that the impact of transnational anti-dam activism is most effective when both DPOS and IPOS are relatively open. Transnational anti-dam advocacy is least effective in influencing state dam policies when both DPOS and IPOS are relatively closed. Under a relatively open DPOS and closed IPOS, transnational anti-dam advocacy is more likely to successfully change state dam policies and even facilitate the opening of relatively closed IPOS. In contrast, under a relatively closed DPOS and open IPOS, transnational anti-dam advocacy can hardly exist. Without the domestic anti-dam pressure from below, international anti-dam efforts from above are less likely to affect state dam policies or open up closed DPOS.",304862911,,Dissertations & Theses," Fu, TengFuTengFu, Teng",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1688983011 , 42769091 , 66569 , 9781109045475 , 3348453 , 3348453", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109045475, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304862911?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," Political science , International law , Sociology"," Social sciences , China , Collective action , Dam , Hydropower , Hydropower development , Political opportunity structure , Transnational network",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dams+and+transnational+advocacy%3A+Political+opportunities+in+transnational+collective+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fu%2C+Teng&amp;isbn=9781109045475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"262,Challenging the Argentine conservative gender regime: The multi-scalar politics of biological reproduction after democratization,"This thesis explains the causes of a gender regime change in Argentina, with a focus on the politics of reproductive rights developed after democratization. The findings suggest that changes in the area of biological reproduction are a departure from the traditional conservative gender regime. Though important aspects of the old regime are still in place, new policies of birth control have been adopted. This gender policy and regime change is occurring in a multi-scalar manner, highlighting the relevance of international, national and sub-national involvement. To understand changes in reproductive policies this thesis examines the role of the Argentine women's movement and how it has been empowered by international developments related to reproductive health and rights. The gender regime is composed of three elements: social reproduction, which includes paid and unpaid work and women's welfare; biological reproduction, including sexuality, fertility and body rights; and women's agency, which is central to understanding the changes associated with the gender regime. It is argued that changes in the Argentinean gender regime are the result of the combined effect of three measures: the 1983 democratization, which allowed for the mobilization of the Argentinean women's movement; the negative impact of welfare state retrenchment on women, brought on by structural adjustment policies; and the international gender equality regime that emerged over the course of the last few decades. Changes in the national gender regime are not only the result of domestic politics and policies, but of international politics as well. This is due to the emergence of the global gender equality regime, which allows extended discourse and new scales of political action. This thesis critically engages with gendered welfare regime theory in order to place Argentina in a comparative framework. Building on the current literature of the welfare and gender regimes of North America and Western Europe, it applies the concept of gender regime to capture the crucial relationship between social and biological reproduction, and the implications for women and gender in/equality. The comparative framework can then be used to analyze the current dynamic situations of other Latin American and/or conservative familial gender regimes.",304863024,,Dissertations & Theses," Lopreite, Debora CeciliaLopreiteCeciliaDeboraLopreite, Debora Cecilia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1891772061 , 43168371 , 66569 , 9780494520833 , NR52083 , NR52083", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494520833, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304863024?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Latin American history , Womens studies , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Argentina , Biological reproduction , Democratization , Gender regime , Reproductive rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Challenging+the+Argentine+conservative+gender+regime%3A+The+multi-scalar+politics+of+biological+reproduction+after+democratization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lopreite%2C+Debora+Cecilia&amp;isbn=9780494520833&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"263,"The sexual politics of the interwar era global governance: Historicizing the women's transnational movements with(in) the League of Nations, 1919–1940","This dissertation aims to excavate the ways in which the interwar era women activists interacted with and influenced the League of Nations with the intention of advancing the ""woman question"" on the transnational agenda. My findings show that women activists succeeded in integrating the ""woman question"" into the League system, by strategizing their mutually-completing feminist convictions on egalitarianism, protectionism and expertism, resulting in expanding women's space in the transnational arena. Women also broadened the notion of the ""woman question"" that they considered as being women's concerns and interests, and also the areas in which they believed women had expertise. Rather than limited to the issues that would directly change women's situations, such as sex-trafficking, equal rights in suffrage, work and marriage, and protective labor legislation, the ""woman question"" became the League's ""social questions"" that was inclusive of various social and political issues, such as public health, protection of children, minorities in mandates, education of young people, information sharing, and censorship of obscene publications. By analyzing women activists' efforts, strategies, and their resultant success in contributing both to the formation and the operation of the League, this dissertation discloses two important aspects of the interwar era transnational women's movements: they marked the ""institutional turn"" in transnational women's movements onward, by working closely with the newly created first general inter-state institution; and they contributed to shaping what constitutes ""international polities"" by institutionalizing the League. The mutual institutionalization between the women's movements and the League shaped international norms of gender, social justice, and ultimately modern international politics. The interwar era women's transnational movements have been relatively under-researched in recent scholarship. Therefore this dissertation contributes to the field by historicizing the women's transnational movements as active participants in constituting the inter-state institution. My work is interdisciplinary that is grounded primarily on the disciplines of women's studies, international relations, and history. By taking the perspective of women activists who worked with(in) the League, as governmental delegates, staff members, and experts, rather than taking those of the states' male elites who represented the interests of their own governments, this dissertation provides an understanding of the League, which is different from a nation-state-centered International Relations' understanding. In so doing, it also challenges the effectiveness of the framework of ""waves,"" a commonly used term in periodizing women's movement history, which fails to capture many aspects of the interwar era women's transnational movements.",304865469,,Dissertations & Theses," Jang, Gyoung SunJangSunGyoungJang, Gyoung Sun"," League of Nations928120", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1798969101 , 47060211 , 66569 , 9781109147810 , 3357524 , 3357524", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109147810, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304865469?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law"," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law"," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law",," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0616 International law"," Womens studies , Modern history , International law , Sexuality"," Social sciences , Global governance , Interwar era sexual politics , Interwar period , League of Nations , Sexual politics , Transnational movements , Women activists , Women and global governance , Women and the League of Nations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sexual+politics+of+the+interwar+era+global+governance%3A+Historicizing+the+women%27s+transnational+movements+with%28in%29+the+League+of+Nations%2C+1919%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jang%2C+Gyoung+Sun&amp;isbn=9781109147810&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"264,"Radical turns from Gramsci to Negri. Life, biopolitics and social change in Italy","In this work I investigate the concept of biopolitics as it emerges in the particular historical setting of twentieth and twenty-first Century Italy. Framing biopolitics as the foregrounding of labor-power, i.e. of the potential to produce, I define three historical moments in which this notion is articulated and gives rise to new social practices in Italy: the 1920 Factory Councils Movement and the philosophy of praxis of Antonio Gramsci, the student Movement of 1968 in its dialogue with Pier Paolo Pasolini, the Marxist neo-feminist discourse on reproduction carried out by Lotta Femminista , and finally the thought of Antonio Negri and its notion of the multitude in the context of the Anti-Globalization Movement. Each of these turning points stages a biopolitical struggle of a determinate subjectivity against the mode of production in power: the workers of the Factory Councils faced the introduction of Fordism; 1968 and Marxist neo-feminism that of Fordism in its advanced phase of automation of production; the multitude of the Anti-Globalization Movement that of post-Fordism with its emphasis on immaterial production. If the biopolitical is today the substratum of our mode of production, from the perspective of Italian political thought, my genealogical reconstruction aims at clarifying the degree of oppression and the contradictions of the biopolitical at a global level.",304877927,,Dissertations & Theses," Righi, AndreaRighiAndreaRighi, Andrea",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1894890551 , 47243781 , 66569 , 9781109409413 , 3376656 , 3376656", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109409413, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304877927?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science"," 0320 Religious history , 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science"," 0320 Religious history , 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science",," 0320 Religious history , 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science"," Religious history , Philosophy , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Biopolitics , Factory councils , Gramsci, Antonio , Italy , Italy Marxist feminism , Negri, Antonio , Pasolini, Pier Paolo , Social change",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Radical+turns+from+Gramsci+to+Negri.+Life%2C+biopolitics+and+social+change+in+Italy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Righi%2C+Andrea&amp;isbn=9781109409413&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"265,Teaching women empowerment: Governmentality in postcolonial India,"In the context of development and poverty alleviation, women's empowerment along with community participation and the idea of self-help is the new global orthodoxy. The rhetoric of radical women's development groups has been co-opted by international development agencies, powerful international financial institutions, states, NGOs and social movements alike. How do International Relations scholars understand this consensus around the notion of women's empowerment? Within International Relations literature this consensus is either interpreted as an example of the increasing isomorphism among nation-states, or alternatively as a new liberal-democratic norm for civilized and modern states to follow. Based on Michel Foucault's notion of governmentality, I will analyze four empowerment projects for women in India to show that their central goal is to constitute the subjects of intervention (mostly poor rural women) as active and responsible, rational, productive individuals with the ability to govern their own lives. Within this context empowerment is a technique of governance that seeks to create self-governing modern, responsible, and productive citizens. Existing accounts of the global women's empowerment movement present it as a veritable panacea for the social and economic predicament of the Third World. I contend that they obscure or underestimate the disciplinary techniques inherent in the empowerment solution. The central argument here is that women's empowerment is better analyzed as a technique of governmentality than a catholicon for the predicament of development.",304879150,,Dissertations & Theses," Rishi, PoojaRishiPoojaRishi, Pooja",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1993336281 , 51387151 , 66569 , 9781109671865 , 3397027 , 3397027", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109671865, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304879150?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0453 Womens studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," Womens studies , International Relations , Political science , Government , Teaching , Colonialism , India , Foucault, Michel"," Social sciences , Empowerment , Gender , Governmentality , India , International , Postcolonial , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teaching+women+empowerment%3A+Governmentality+in+postcolonial+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rishi%2C+Pooja&amp;isbn=9781109671865&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"266,Interactions between Northern Nigeria and the Arab world in the twentieth century,"This essay explores contacts between Northern Nigeria and the Arab world during the twentieth century, especially through pilgrimage, educational exchange, transnational organizations, and Arab financial support for Nigerian religious and political entrepreneurs.

Since then, however, Solidarity has greatly diminished in size and significance. This dissertation, based on data from Solidarity Weekly from 1989 to 2008, as well as other secondary sources and a dozen in-depth interviews with union leaders in Poland, tries to uncover the cause of Solidarity’s decline by looking at both global and local factors. The global factors involve the ascendance of economic neoliberalism in the world in the 1980s and 1990s that also became dominant as economic policy orthodoxy in Poland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Here, the role of transnational financial institutions as well as groups of Western economists is particularly important to the success of neoliberalism in Poland. These institutions and persons have been from the beginning involved in shaping the economic reforms that established a market economy in the early 1990s but also negatively affected blue collar workers and labor unions. Furthermore, I found that multinational corporations have played an active part in diminishing the role of trade unions in Poland. These foreign entities have purchased a significant number of Polish formerly state-owned enterprises, including banks, and often actively engaged in tactics to avoid unions. No small part in these developments was played by the collapse of the international trade patterns of Poland established after World War II that was caused by the economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Finally, the global factors include new cultural trends that have spread all over Eastern and Central Europe in the form of consumerism and pop culture. These trends have negatively affected Solidarity who relied on traditional values of patriotism, sacrifice, and social solidarity to attract members to the organization. My research also points to the importance of local factors that have mediated the influence of globalization with respect to the decline of Solidarity. The first of these factors can be called “social movement inertia” of Solidarity. Solidarity, since its birth in 1980 existed as a trade union but acquired all the characteristics associated with a social movement. Those characteristics, so beneficial in Poland under communism, became a hindrance to Solidarity as a trade union. Here, particularly important are the attempts of the leadership of Solidarity to use Solidarity as a social movement for change and as a political party to win power. No small part of those efforts by the leadership of Solidarity was shaped by the collapse of the Polish economy and the emergent “nomenklatura capitalism” that was seen as a threat to reforms. Finally, I found that the attitudes of workers and intelligentsia that comprised Solidarity, heavily influenced by Polish cultural traditions and history, contributed to the dominant perception of socialism as a discredited ideology and practice and have led to the embrace of capitalism by workers and union leaders.",304884490,,Dissertations & Theses," Lukasik, Gregory A.LukasikA.GregoryLukasik, Gregory A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1917142741 , 49777241 , 66569 , 9781109510720 , 3385280 , 3385280", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109510720, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304884490?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations",," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations"," European history , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Poland , Solidarity , Trade unions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+the+global+and+the+local%3A+The+rise+and+decline+of+Solidarity%0Ain+Poland%2C+1980-2008&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lukasik%2C+Gregory+A.&amp;isbn=9781109510720&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"268,Muslim movements nurturing a cosmopolitan Muslim identity: The Ismaili and Gulen movement,"The convergence of contemporary international affairs with religion calls for a new lens for interaction. This convergence, combined with the global topography of militant ideologies in the name of Islam, the impact of the War on Terror, and the rift in Muslim-West relations has caused confusion and anxiety among Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This contemporary reality calls for original thinking and new models to address some of these religious, political and social concerns and to sow the seeds of peaceful and pluralistic cooperation. Several responses that promote international global justice and encourage conflict resolution economic and social development while being Muslim are available to address this new reality. The Ismaili Muslim and the Gulen community are two such examples. By advocating the reinterpretation of the Islamic message in light of contemporary realities and seeking to bridge the gap holistically between the Muslim world and the West, the Ismaili and Gulen movements offer creative possibilities of conception, thought, and action through transnational activism embedded in Islamic principles. To demonstrate these possibilities and realities, this paper seeks to illustrate how the Ismaili and Gulen movements are in fact reinterpreting the message of Islam in light of contemporary realities while playing an active role in the development of educational institutions, philanthropy, and inter-faith dialogues with other communities. They serve as examples of progressive, transnational social movements that are rooted in Islamic tradition while negotiating a new kind of Islam in the modern world. By analyzing the movements four key segments including: (1) vision of Islam (2) leadership (3) organizational structure and membership, (4) key program engagements the paper seeks to provide a holistic understanding of its emergence, development and transformation. Most contemporary writings on Islam tend to portray global Islamic activism in a negative light, but through strong emphasis on tolerance, service, philanthropy, education, and pluralism, Gulen and the Aga Khan are reshaping Muslim globality and offering an alternative view of Islam and what it means to be a Muslim in today's world. Within the context of globalization, pluralism, multiculturalism, and internationalism, the Ismaili and the Gulen movements serve as modern day articulations of Muslim cosmopolitanism. The movements are reshaping Muslim ethos and a faith based identity while cultivating a new paradigm for cultural, religious, and social engagement and interaction for a more equitable and just world.",304887097,,Dissertations & Theses," Shroff, SaraShroffSaraShroff, Sara",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1717505851 , 42787371 , 66569 , 9781109099690 , 1463629 , 1463629", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109099690, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304887097?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure",," 0318 Religion , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," Religion , International law , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Aga Khan , Cosmopolitan , Gulen , Muslim , Social movement , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Muslim+movements+nurturing+a+cosmopolitan+Muslim+identity%3A+The+Ismaili+and+Gulen+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shroff%2C+Sara&amp;isbn=9781109099690&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"269,"Analyzing a social movement's use of Internet: Resource mobilization, new social movement theories and the case of Falun Gong","Falun Gong emerged as spiritual social movement after being outlawed by the Chinese Communist Party authorities in 1999. Since then, Falun Gong practitioners have made heavy use of information and communication technologies, particularly the Internet, to further their movement's activities. This dissertation systematically examines the role of Internet technology (i.e. use, impact, development and consequences) on Falun Gong activists through the lenses of resource mobilization (RM) and new social movement (NSM) theories. Major theories, theoretical observations and empirical findings by various social movement researchers are examined to understand the development of social movements and the relationship between social movements and Internet technology. This study employs two major research strategies; a qualitative single case study (consisting of three main methods: unstructured interviews, participant observations, and document review) and a quantitative survey questionnaire. A conceptual scheme is constructed by drawing upon key components from RM and NSM theories to guide data analysis. Results reveal that as a grassroots social movement, Falun Gong has been positively impacted by practitioners' uses of Internet technology in three main ways. Interviewees and respondents use multiple Internet services and develop innovative software modified to suit their movement needs. They are able to access and acquire various types of resources (e.g., knowledge, money, materials). They are capable of making use of the opportunities offered by the Internet to work on a range of online tactics to mobilize online/offline action and undermine the influence of the CCP's counteractions. Furthermore, Internet use is a catalyst for constructing the practitioners' collective identity and reinforcing the social network of the movement among distant practitioners. Falun Gong practitioners have embraced the opportunities that the Internet affords and have found creative and innovative uses for its global social movement mobilization while negotiating around its constraints. This dissertation argues that a case study combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches is useful and provides the researcher with different and fruitful ways of operationalizing and measuring theoretical constructs that can be used to study social movements. The combination of RM and NSM theories serves as a solid framework to analyze online grassroots social movements.",304899502,,Dissertations & Theses," Huang, Bi YunHuangYunBiHuang, Bi Yun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1934590061 , 44007001 , 66569 , 9781109523317 , 3386686 , 3386686", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109523317, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304899502?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0723 Information science"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0723 Information science"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0723 Information science",," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0723 Information science"," Religion , Sociology , Information science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Collective identity , Falun Gong , Internet , New social movements , Resource mobilization , Social informatics , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analyzing+a+social+movement%27s+use+of+Internet%3A+Resource+mobilization%2C+new+social+movement+theories+and+the+case+of+Falun+Gong&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huang%2C+Bi+Yun&amp;isbn=9781109523317&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"270,Tending the garden: The country life movement between productivity and sustainability,"This study explores the seventy-five year history of the Country Life Movement (CLM), 1901-1976, and its attempt to reconcile agricultural modernization with traditional agrarian practices. Drawing on themes of democracy, globalization, and sustainable development and theories of articulation, metaphor, and myth, I provide an account of a social movement's rhetorical invention of symbolic resources for cultural production. The CLM is divided, for purposes of analysis, into three rhetorical phases of social action. I argue that rhetorical representations of the land were transformed through these three phases from an image of cooperation to one of division and domination. In its first phase, 1901-1914, the movement drew on the narrative of America's mythic garden to invent an emergent rhetoric of sustainable development through an articulation of productivity that was compatible with land ecology. Concurrently with an emphasis on land ecology, the CLM expressed an initial attitude of globalization as a cooperative process of mutual economic and agrarian exchange. While remaining insistent on the land's ecology, the second phase, 1914-1939, confronted a government and state unconcerned with the declining economic and social position of American agrarians. With the land as a symbol of cooperation, country lifers challenged the state on democratic grounds by dissociating citizens from the state and the state from democracy. A democratic attitude of cooperation and equality, grounded in an affinity with the land, was embodied in agrarians. The final phase, 1939-1976, illustrates how a movement can become captive to the very symbolic resources it invents. As the movement began to cast aside its emphasis on land ecology, the mythic garden was symbolically transformed into an industrial Eden, driven by a metaphor of development which undermined the movement's commitment to sustainable development. As the land became a symbol of place-based division, an attitude of domination resulted that emphasized rural virtue over urban blight and U.S. exceptionalism over international iniquity. Overall, this study reveals the centrality of the symbolic land in the attitudes and practices of citizens. With the land developing over time into a rhetorical source of place-based divisions, the CLM ultimately expressed an exploitative attitude of imperial globalization.",304900043,,Dissertations & Theses," Motter, Jeffrey BrianMotterBrianJeffreyMotter, Jeffrey Brian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1934631841 , 44029771 , 66569 , 9781109523560 , 3386708 , 3386708", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109523560, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304900043?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0459 Communication"," 0323 American studies , 0459 Communication"," 0323 American studies , 0459 Communication",," 0323 American studies , 0459 Communication"," American studies , Communication"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Agriculture , Country life movement , Environment , Modernization , Productivity , Social movements , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tending+the+garden%3A+The+country+life+movement+between+productivity+and+sustainability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Motter%2C+Jeffrey+Brian&amp;isbn=9781109523560&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"271,Cuando llovió dinero en Macondo: Literatura y narcotráfico en Colombia y México,"This study deals with the representation of drug trafficking in six narrative texts from Colombia and Mexico. Narco-narratives examine the social structures that drug trafficking has brought to Latin American society, which I refer to collectively as the culture of “easy money”. These texts are the product of a global phenomenon and highlight the tensions within neo-liberalism, globalization and the war on drugs. The first chapter explores the changes and effects that drug trafficking creates in different social groups, especially among intellectuals in two Colombian novels, La Virgen de los sicarios (Fernando Vallejo, 1994) and Cartas cruzadas (Darío Jaramillo Agudelo, 1995). Chapter two shows how the culture of easy money transforms the lives of the novels' characters in the Colombian text Hijos de la nieve (José Libardo Porras, 2000). Narco-culture, as promoted by the culture of “easy money”, has transformed the way that society views traditional values such as labor and education; it creates a new scale of value in which consumerism directs the lives of a growing number of individuals. Chapter three examine the ways that popular corrido and oral traditions employ specific narrative codes to represent the influence of drug trafficking in Northern México in two Mexican texts, Juan Justino Judicial (Gerardo Cornejo, 1996) and “La parte de Chuy Salcido” (Elmer Mendoza, 1991). The final chapter underscores how the Mexican novel The gringo connection (Armando Ayala Anguiano, 2000) stakes out ideological positions that include legalization and criminalization, within a broader cultural context. This study works with concepts such as agency, heteroglossia and characterization to show how the culture of “easy money” transformed social structures and the ways that narco-narratives represent changes in the subjectivity of a country's people. At the same time that I make reference to national frameworks, I also emphasize that a global prospective is needed to understand the transnational connections and trends represented in narco-narratives. Drug trafficking is a phenomenon that takes advantage of market movements and is inscribed within the dynamics of a globalized society. My study points out how narco-narratives permeate the culture and society of countries around the world. Although narco-narratives include a multitude of texts, they all highlight the consequences of failed government policies and the end of social utopias in Latin America. Through the analysis of this set of texts, my study contributes to our understanding of the ways that narco-narratives interpellate characters, authors and readers to explore ethical positions vis-à-vis drug trafficking and its effects in Colombian and Mexican cultures.",304906446,,Dissertations & Theses," Fonseca, AlbertoFonsecaAlbertoFonseca, Alberto",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1891615581 , 49250861 , 66569 , 9781109402322 , 3373460 , 3373460", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109402322, Spanish, Spanish,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304906446?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature"," Modern literature , Latin American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Colombia , Colombian literature , Drug trafficking , Drug trafficking and literature , Mexican literature , Mexico , Virgen de los sicarios",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cuando+llovi%C3%B3+dinero+en+Macondo%3A+Literatura+y+narcotr%C3%A1fico+en+Colombia+y+M%C3%A9xico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fonseca%2C+Alberto&amp;isbn=9781109402322&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"272,Economic reform and the ‘double movement’ in Yugoslavia: An analysis of labor unrest and ethno-nationalism in the 1980s,"This study is the first complete analysis of social upheaval in Yugoslavia in the 1980s, especially on the groundswell of organized labor resistance that emerged in resistance to rapid economic transformation. This study introduces a new data source on ""events of labor unrest"" (ELUs) in the period, consisting of nearly 1500 reports of labor unrest (RLUs) culled from the former Yugoslavia's main Serbo-Croatian news publications from the years 1980-1988. The data advance a striking argument and a new historical perspective on the causes of ELUs, their direct consequences, their distribution, and their role in the breakdown of the Yugoslav Federation. Labor unrest emerged as a threat to the Federal Government of Yugoslavia in response to the many attempts to introduce the policies of economic ""shock therapy"" promoted by the International Monetary Fund. These policies sought to reduce wages, close unprofitable firms, reorganize social relationships within the workplace, and otherwise control inflation. The death of Tito in 1980 is shown to have created a leadership vacuum that was filled by a series of increasingly 'disembedded' economic experts who were accountable mainly to the IMF, the agency that acted as gatekeeper of foreign investment in the face of the Federation's growing credit problems. As the decade wore on, workers across the Federation resorted to striking as the primary means of communicating their dissatisfaction with the federal government and its policies. This study tracks the development of the workers' movement Federation-wide, and also pays considerable attention to several case studies: Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Kosovo, and Macedonia. The similarities in the development of an organized labor movement in these regions are shown to correspond to similar processes of extreme nationalist parties capturing the momentum for social change generated by labor actions in all but one case. The study applies Karl Polanyi's framework of ""The Great Transformation"" to explain how labor emerged in the interest of the ""self-protection of society"" to resist the attempt to ""disembed"" the market from social relations, and then posits that this very process of social self-protection created a political impasse out of which emerged a process of fragmentation along sectarian lines that violently terminated the possibility for the Federation's existence.",304914807,,Dissertations & Theses," Lowinger, JakeLowingerJakeLowinger, Jake",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1964251431 , 46645891 , 66569 , 9781109577914 , 3392335 , 3392335", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109577914, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304914807?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," European history , Labor relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , Economic reform , Ethnic war , Labor unrest , Nineteen 80s , Polanyi, Karl , Restructuring , Yugoslavia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Economic+reform+and+the+%E2%80%98double+movement%E2%80%99+in+Yugoslavia%3A+An+analysis+of+labor+unrest+and+ethno-nationalism+in+the+1980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lowinger%2C+Jake&amp;isbn=9781109577914&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"273,"A cultural interpretation of the South Korean Independent Cinema Movement, 1975–2004","A Cultural Interpretation of the South Korean Independent Cinema Movement, 1975-2004 examines the origin and development of the independent cinema movement in South Korea.

Investigating the independent cinema movement offers new perspectives on the cultural study of national cinema movement and the existing scholarship of South Korean cinema. This dissertation questions the dominant historiography regarding South Korean cinema which centers on the 1960s as the 'golden age' of South Korean cinema and the 1990s as its renaissance. This position tends to dismiss the intervening decades of the 1970s and 80 as the 'dark age' of the national cinema. Defying the conventional view, this study shows the presence of the new generation of filmmakers and young cinephiles who launched a series of new cinema movements from the 1970s onward. In this regard, the 1970s should be reinterpreted as the period that marked the genesis of the new wave consciousness in the history of South Korean cinema. Second, this study analyzes the history of the independent cinema movement as a dialogic process between domestic cultural discourse and foreign film theories. The filmmakers who initiated the independent cinema movement drew on Euro-American art cinemas, New Latin American Cinema, and the feminist films from the West to incorporate them into the domestic cultural context, producing the new concepts such as the Small Film, the People's Cinema and the woman's film. This fact challenges the national cinema discourse which presupposes that the history of South Korean cinema is established within the closed circuit of the national history and traditional aesthetics. My dissertation helps create an alternative perspective by which to see the construction of national cinema as fundamentally an interaction between indigenous popular discourses and international film new waves. Finally, this dissertation takes into consideration the active roles of the independent filmmakers. It examines the films and manuscripts produced by the filmmakers to see how they invented and elaborated their positions about cinema movement in the given cultural field in each period. It pays attention to the cultural field where the filmmakers are conditioned between what they wanted to visualize and what is externally granted. Viewing an established cultural field as a hegemonic construction, this study also investigates the way in which transformation occurs from one cultural field to another.",304916778,,Dissertations & Theses," Park, NohchoolParkNohchoolPark, Nohchool",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1752011771 , 43888741 , 66569 , 9781109150056 , 3355712 , 3355712", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109150056, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304916778?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0377 Art history"," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0377 Art history"," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0377 Art history",," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0377 Art history"," Asian literature , History , Art history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Independent documentary , National cinema , People's cinema , Small film , South Korean Independent Cinema Movement , Woman's film",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+cultural+interpretation+of+the+South+Korean+Independent+Cinema%0AMovement%2C+1975%E2%80%932004&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Park%2C+Nohchool&amp;isbn=9781109150056&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"274,“Caring for the least of these”: Christian women's short -term mission travel,"This dissertation explores how Christian women strategically activated social networks to do short-term mission (STM) and take on new leadership roles, creatively reinventing and rejuvenating themselves through international volunteerism. A growing religious movement, STM carework is a democratized grassroots phenomenon, typically featuring bottom-up entrepreneurial agency rather than top-down central planning and control which lends itself to women's involvement. This research used global ethnography and visual analysis to examine and theorize how social capital and resource brokering was built locally and globally, bridging and linking women within two respective groups across international spaces: (1) an incorporated not-for-profit medical professional group that traveled regularly to Africa; and (2) a suburban women's ministry group from a megachurch who conducted a large women's retreat in the Domincan Republic and also worked in an orphanage. The first group included team members from mainline, Catholic and evangelical traditions. The second group incorporated Latina women from the megachurch's Hispanic sister congregation, and included four Latina women on the traveling team. Each group's activities and narratives illuminated the crucial role of cultural brokers to mediate material and symbolic resources essential to the achievement of their work on behalf of those deemed ""needy."" Also, examination of normally private marital gender relations revealed that couples negotiated fender roles either in ways they had already practiced (egalitarian) or in exceptional ways (unbending gender roles). Research on Christian women's STM resource brokering contributes to studies on congregations, volunteerism, civil society, social capital, faith-based initiatives, international development, women's religion, tourism, pilgrimage, and religion and globalization. Both professional and stay-at-home mothers benefitted from regularized church/state funding structures (pooled tax-exempt donations) which facilitated costly travel not dependent on personal/family finances. An emerging pattern of Christians (often Pentecostal) in the Global South connected with resourced caring women from the Global North, who eschew suburban materialism for international service projects, has enabled heightened pilgrimage-like experiences which translate into constitutive narratives of personal transformation and resource brokering activities. The strategies of STM women and their intentional efforts to establish international fictive kin disrupt notions of ""home""/""away from home"" as well as theoretical assumptions of structural alterity conceived as ""authentic"" versus ""inauthentic."" Images of needy individuals were imprinted upon volunteers' memories and displayed through ubiquitous photos that (re)informed themselves, their families, co-workers, financial supporters and numerous networks of their own Christian gendered caring identity. This research suggests such dense interconnections of relationship mediated through media, donations, travel, and narratives, are interactions indicative of new global religion which has ""gone public"" as Christian care ""without borders."" Specifically, the overlap of various STM brokers (resource and cultural) in delimited ""zones of contact"" is a rich node of globalization which needs further investigation because it is within such temporally delimited nodes that juncture and disjuncture takes place. And it is here that misunderstandings and unintended consequences may derail the lofty aims of those who seek to truly make a difference in a suffering world—for the ""least of these.""",304922386,,Dissertations & Theses," Priest, Kersten BaytPriestBaytKerstenPriest, Kersten Bayt",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1898265381 , 49424961 , 66569 , 9781109397574 , 3377753 , 3377753", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109397574, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304922386?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology",," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology"," Religion , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christian , Globalization , Media and missions , Missionary trips , Resource brokering , Volunteerism , Women , Women's religion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CCaring+for+the+least+of+these%E2%80%9D%3A+Christian+women%27s%0Ashort+-term+mission+travel&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Priest%2C+Kersten+Bayt&amp;isbn=9781109397574&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"275,Liberation at the end of a pen: Writing Pan -African politics of cultural struggle,"As a political, social, and cultural ideology, Pan-Africanism has been a complex movement attempting to ameliorate the dehumanizing effects of “the global Eurocentric colonial/modern capitalist model of power,” which Anibal Quijano (2000) refers to as “the coloniality of power.” The destructive forces of the coloniality of power—beginning with the transatlantic slave trade—that led to the dispersal and displacement of millions of Africans subsequently facilitated the creation of Pan-African political and cultural consciousness. Thus, this dissertation examines diverse articulations of Pan-African politics of cultural struggle as a response to racist and sexist oppression and economic exploitation of Afro-descendants. I am specifically interested in the formation of international politico-cultural movements, such as the Black Arts movement, Négritude, and the Pan-African Cultural Revolution and their ideological alignments to political liberation struggles for the emancipation of people of African descent. With varying degrees of revolutionary commitment, intellectuals in each of these movements utilized literary and cultural production to raise the political consciousness of Africans and Afro-descendants to combat forces that oppressed their communities. To demonstrate this, my dissertation historicizes and analyzes the numerous Pan-African festivals, congresses, and conferences, which occurred between 1965 and 1977, while interrogating the specific manifestations of “translocal” contacts and linkages between movement intellectuals. I chose to focus on these years because they roughly correspond with the historical time period known as the Black Arts movement in North America (1965-1975), which had a vibrant, yet understudied Pan-African worldview. Moreover, while Pan-Africanism gained considerable traction after World War II, it was particularly between 1966 and 1977 that intellectuals aligned with Négritude and Pan-African Marxism competed for ideological hegemony of the movement on the African continent and in the African Diaspora.",304923949,,Dissertations & Theses," Ratcliff, Anthony J.RatcliffJ.AnthonyRatcliff, Anthony J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1878320481 , 47537391 , 66569 , 9781109352153 , 3372273 , 3372273", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109352153, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304923949?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history"," Comparative literature , Black studies , Black history"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African , Black Arts movement , Cultural struggle , Diaspora , Negritude , Pan-Africanism , Third world",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Liberation+at+the+end+of+a+pen%3A+Writing+Pan+-African+politics%0Aof+cultural+struggle&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ratcliff%2C+Anthony+J.&amp;isbn=9781109352153&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"276,"Crossing borders: Women, migration, and domestic work at the Texas-Mexico divide","This dissertation explores the temporary migration of Mexican women who reside in Mexican border cities and travel daily to American border cities to labor in domestic service. Based on in-depth interviews and participant observation with domestic workers, employers, and community members in the paired border cities of Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, I study this frequent movement across international borders to analyze how this movement creates and reinforces inequalities of class, gender, and nationality in these borderlands. This study explores three distinct but interrelated themes regarding Mexican women's migration. First, I examine the pre-emigration context that drives Mexican women to temporarily migrate as undocumented domestic laborers to border cities in the United States. I do so by analyzing the social and economic conditions in Mexico that have motivated working-class women to seek employment outside their country. Second, I analyze the recurrent movement of women crossing international borders, whose legal entry into U.S. border cities is complicated by their undocumented employment in domestic service. This pseudo-legal migration creates a space wherein different areas represent “safe” and “risky” zones for the cross-border worker. Finally, I examine the (re)production of difference by domestic workers and employers. I explore how borders and boundaries in the lives of cross-border workers span the political and geographic divide that they cross daily and permeate the dynamics between workers and employers. I deploy the concept of symbolic boundaries to analyze the production of difference and how difference is negotiated in the relations between Mexican domestic workers and Mexican American employers. This study makes a contribution to the discipline of sociology by examining the temporary migration of workers which has been largely absent in the scholarship of migration. The movement of these women contributes to an understanding of the social inequalities embedded their migration and their labor as workers. It also brings attention to the inequalities of social class, gender, and nationality among co-ethnic women, who are typically essentialized in the literature and depicted as a homogeneous group.",304940128,,Dissertations & Theses," Mendoza, ChristinaMendozaChristinaMendoza, Christina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1798971351 , 43860991 , 66569 , 9781109115185 , 3354329 , 3354329", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109115185, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304940128?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0626 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Sociology , Hispanic American studies , Women , Migration , Domestic service , Texas , Mexico"," Social sciences , Domestic work , Gender , Immigration , Laredo , Mexico , Texas-Mexico , United States-Mexico border , Women workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crossing+borders%3A++Women%2C+migration%2C+and+domestic+work+at+the+Texas-Mexico+divide&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mendoza%2C+Christina&amp;isbn=9781109115185&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Ethnic NewsWatch,GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"277,The Kosovo Liberation Army: Changes in the presentation of ethnic and civic nationalistic values to the media,"This study investigates how nationalistic ideologies were presented to the media by the guerilla movement known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The KLA has an interesting history as a social movement. As an organization in the heart of an area riddled by war and conquest, the KLA was created in response to Albanian oppression by Serbian forces in the early 1990s. A strong history of Albanian nationalism was the founding ideology of the KLA; and it was this ideology that mobilized large public support and a steady influx of recruits. At the end of the 1990s, the KLA became increasingly successful at attracting international attention for their cause. Through these efforts, the KLA had to behave in such a way so as to ensure continued support for foreign bodies. By downplaying their Albanian nationalistic ideologies, among other tactics, the KLA succeeded in securing international intervention in Kosovo. The central question examined in this research is if and how nationalistic values presented by members of the KLA changed over time (from the movement's media debut to its fractionation into various other movements). Two types of nationalistic values were studied: civic nationalism and ethnic nationalism. A content analysis of newspaper interviews from 1997 to 2003 with members from the KLA was conducted to determine the frequency of nationalistic value expression. Word frequencies of each value were analyzed as proportions, and graphically analyzed to determine the occurrence and direction of change in the ethnic and civic national values presented to the media by KLA members.",304946933,,Dissertations & Theses," Eckhardt, Jessica LeeEckhardtLeeJessicaEckhardt, Jessica Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1806506281 , 47233271 , 66569 , 9781109208603 , 1466828 , 1466828", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109208603, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304946933?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0616 International law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0616 International law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0708 Mass communications",," 0616 International law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0708 Mass communications"," International law , Ethnic studies , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Kosovo+Liberation+Army%3A+Changes+in+the+presentation+of+ethnic+and+civic+nationalistic+values+to+the+media&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Eckhardt%2C+Jessica+Lee&amp;isbn=9781109208603&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"278,"Nine clouds: A social history of New York City Nikkei, volume 1, 1900–1940","This work examines the question of why an ethnic Japanese community with identifiable physical boundaries did not form in New York City between the late 19th Century and 1940. The work contends that New York’s position as the American center of international trade, finance, and the literary and cultural arts attracted a diversity of highly-educated ethnic Japanese residents who formed five micro communities based upon a melding of Eastern and Western class and status concepts. The micro communities were part of a four-tiered social hierarchy and a separate student sphere. The class- and status-based community structure challenges the prevalent view that ethnicity and culture were the foremost factors in the formation and development of social relations within Issei and Nisei communities on the American mainland. The work further asserts that four distinct, ideology-based social movements formed and developed during this same time period -- America-Japan dualism, radicalism, Americanism, and ethnocentrism. Although there was some overlap with the community hierarchy, notably with regard to the ethnocentric and dualist movements, the four social movements operated largely independent of and isolated from each other and from the four tiers and the student sphere. The work concludes that ethnocentric efforts, particularly those of ethnic Japanese churches, were crucial in nurturing ethnic-based social and cultural capital among Nikkei residents of New York City. The churches were largely responsible for maintaining a collective Nikkei identity and a semblance of community solidarity amidst the status, class, and sociopolitical ideological divisions.",304948983,,Dissertations & Theses," Inouye, Daniel H.InouyeH.DanielInouye, Daniel H.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1826277621 , 47700731 , 66569 , 9781109258141 , 3360480 , 3360480", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109258141, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304948983?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , American history , Modern history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Civil rights , Class and status , Japanese foreign policy , Japanese-Americans , New York , New York City , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nine+clouds%3A+A+social+history+of+New+York+City+Nikkei%2C+volume+1%2C+1900%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Inouye%2C+Daniel+H.&amp;isbn=9781109258141&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"279,Health social movements in a transnational context: Racing around the world for a cure,"Beginning in the 1990s, the two largest, most influential and well-known breast cancer advocacy organizations in the US, Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the Avon Foundation, began expanding biomedical breast cancer advocacy internationally. Focusing on these organizations' development within the US and subsequent expansion, particularly within Puerto Rico and Italy, within this qualitative intrinsic case study, I draw from medical sociology and social movement theory to analyze how and why these breast cancer advocacy organizations have expanded globally, how advocacy strategies and tactics have been incorporated into diverse political and cultural contexts, and how corporate sponsors, particularly pharmaceutical and medical technology companies, and medical professionals have participated in the organizations' expansion to shed light on the role of transnational health advocacy organizations in processes of biomedicalization and the political economy of health and illness on an international scale. I find that SGKC, as an elite advocacy organization, and the Avon Foundation, as the outgrowth of a corporation, expanded based on a corporate model of market expansion. These organizations socially constructed breast cancer as a critical global epidemic requiring increased awareness and education about breast cancer, thereby positioning their approach to breast cancer as the solution to the problem and legitimizing their expansion efforts. To expand beyond the US, SGKC and the Avon Foundation developed transnational mixed actor coalitions, in which they partnered with governmental agencies, medical professionals and research centers, and corporations, blurring the boundaries between the non-profit social sector and various sectors of society. Implementing only minor political and cultural adaptations to their biomedical advocacy strategies, SGKC and the Avon Foundation, through their global events, campaigns and programs, are facilitating processes of biomedicalization through messages of awareness and education, the dissemination of medical information, the promotion of ""surveillance medicine,"" and the production of new ""at-risk"" and medical consumer identities. Finally, by promoting cause-related marketing and corporate sponsorship and involvement in advocacy events internationally, SGKC and the Avon Foundation are playing a significant role in the global political economy of health and illness by promoting corporate and consumer-oriented solutions to health problems.",304949979,,Dissertations & Theses," Baralt, Lori B.BaraltB.LoriBaralt, Lori B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1891635511 , 47934541 , 66569 , 9781109413724 , 3381087 , 3381087", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109413724, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304949979?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology," Sociology , Public health , Social psychology"," Social sciences , Biomedicalization , Breast cancer , Globalization , Health activism , Social movements , Transnational movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Health+social+movements+in+a+transnational+context%3A+Racing+around+the+world+for+a+cure&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baralt%2C+Lori+B.&amp;isbn=9781109413724&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"280,"Latin American artists in postwar Paris: Jesús Rafael Soto and Julio Le Parc, 1950–1970","This dissertation presents an alternative model for interpreting the work of Jesús Rafael Soto (Venezuelan, 1923-2005) and Julio Le Parc (Argentine, b. 1928), the two foremost Latin American proponents of Kinetic art. While Soto and Le Parc are traditionally studied together within the context of their European counterparts, this investigation argues for a new way of evaluating the artists in terms of the ""fragmented"" aesthetic experience they provided through works produced in 1950-1970, the period during which both artists moved to Paris. This paper demonstrates that their artistic innovations were--like their radical social agendas and ideals--critical responses to Latin America's modernity. Characterized by continuous political and social upheaval, a break with traditional values, and an uncertain future, the disruptive environment they experienced in Latin America compelled the artists to pursue in Paris the primary aesthetic strategies of their work: displacement, mutability, and instability. Though they differed in approaches, Soto and Le Parc shared a utopian ideal: that art, distilled to its experiential fundamentals, could communicate directly to the viewer, without the mediation of politics or institutions. Through analyses of specific works, archival documentation, contemporary criticism, and interviews with Soto, Le Parc, and others from their circles, this study explores the lives and work of these two artists, revealing that their summary relegation to specific movements and nationalities discounts the complex reality of their transnational experiences. The model of investigation proposed here reveals the distinct two-way reciprocity of cultural influence between Latin America and Europe, and raises questions about geographical cultural specificity.

Soto and Le Parc's formative dialogues with individuals and collectives, in particular Victor Vasarely, Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Los Disidentes, the Madí, Nouveaux Réalistes, group Zero, artists of Situationist International and Tucumán arde are closely examined.

Summit hopping became an important form of transnationally-coordinated resistance to neoliberal capitalism and the “free trade agenda” for millions of activists who were part of a growing global network of social movements, struggles and tendencies that came to be known collectively as the “global justice movement.” As the most public and visible form of global justice activism during this period, summit protests were spectacular and unpredictable events through which activists created “global” spaces again and again in local places around the world. In my discussion of these spaces, I trace both regularities—in protest infrastructure, in forms of engagement, in policing routines, and in popular imaginaries of protest—and singularities—the locally particular conditions of each summit setting that interrupted and redirected activists’ and observers’ expectations about what global justice activism was about. “Edge effects” in the context of summit protests were the unpredictable dynamics of encounter among distinct activist groups and between activists, on the one hand, and police, media workers, and residents of host cities, on the other. These dynamics of encounter included adaptations, knowledge production, and hybridizations/reformulations of projects; however, edge effects also included the distortions, myths, misrepresentations and exaggerations generated in official, popular and activist discourse about protesters and protest events. The ethnographic material is organized around three foci: (1) the physical composition of summit protests, with specific attention to the significance of security fences as edge markers in the practical and social dynamics of global justice activism; (2) summit protests as actualizations of global imaginaries in local places, with specific attention to the interactive encounters in the edges created between visiting protesters and local residents; (3) “edge projects” that emerged from global protest contexts but took on lives of their own, with specific attention to the Really Really Free Market project. In the events and relations described in this ethnographic material, edge effects are highlighted as a significant and productive dynamic of protests not often addressed in social movement scholarship.",304958667,,Dissertations & Theses," Daro, Vinci E.

The main theoretical thrust of this work is to challenge new social movement theory, which focuses solely on identity-based politics, and thus to complicate reductionist economistic approaches to peasant politics. An identity-based approach fails to see cultural struggles in dynamic relationship to larger political and economic transitions, while a deterministic political-economic analysis often obfuscates the subtle, everyday social interactions critical to shaping oppositional politics at local and regional levels. Instead, this study emphasizes the concrete historical processes of uneven geographic development that gave rise to new social movements of displaced farmers who rely upon a rich highland indigenous identity as a critical cultural and political resource. Performative oral tales of ancient Andean mythical heroes and their ayllu communities motivate the landless to take part in land occupations and serve as a blueprint or creative cartography for the remapping of communal and productive relations. The transport of oral tales from the local to the regional level defines horizontal, participatory, and democratic spaces of governance. Cultural-political framings such as the ayllu are no longer confined to a particular locale, but over time have become transportable and elastic discourses used to negotiate national-level land policies and redistributive reforms. Finally, this dissertation documents the spectacular backlash to such progressive movements and maps new forms of right-wing resistance in the region. I return to performative politics as an analytic construct and present some of the murky terrain as cultural strategies move from localized movement building to national and international arenas. I end, however, not in focusing on the contradictions of performative politics, but rather on the possibility of globalizing the agrarian struggle.",304962315,,Dissertations & Theses," Fabricant, NicoleFabricantNicoleFabricant, Nicole",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1722341371 , 43470061 , 66569 , 9781109103847 , 3352564 , 3352564", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109103847, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304962315?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Bolivia , Indigenous rights , Landless workers , Oral tales , Performance , Resistance , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performative+politics%3A+Landless+workers%27+creative+strategies+of+resistance+in+lowland+Bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fabricant%2C+Nicole&amp;isbn=9781109103847&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"283,"‘The sciences are never at war?’: The scientific Republic of Letters in the era of the French Revolution, 1789-1815","What did it mean to portray science as a transnational, apolitical endeavor in an era of nationalism and total war?

Amazonian indigenous, low income and rural peoples are the social groups most susceptible to social, environmental and health problems caused by unsustainable practices such as large-scale extractive industries. One of the landmarks of oil development in the Peruvian Amazon was the discovery in 1971, of a large oil deposits in block IAB that include the Corrientes River basin, Department of Loreto. The promises of 'development' to be realized from these oil deposits never made reference to benefits for local natives. They were 'invisible' or ignored. Exclusion of indigenous people from the body politic and the sacrifice of their political right were underestimated to privilege the very concept of productive land use. This thesis advances our understanding of the social, political and environmental concerns that influenced the formation of a movement among the Achuar indigenous people, in response to oil exploitation activities in the Corrientes River basin in the Peruvian Amazon. This study is based on a political ecology analysis of my work over the last seven years and a review of existing literature on local and global relations of environmental issues. This thesis addresses the dynamic relationships between indigenous groups, local and international environmental rights movements, and the government often have contested views of development, nature, environment, and health. The Corrientes River case reveals how Amazonian indigenous people gained competence to demand recognition of their collective rights to health and citizenship as a result of strategic alliances with national, transnational groups and the support of the Ombudsman office. It also exposes weaknesses of some state institutions to address social-environmental conflicts. The Achuar people's mobilization was a result of frustration of over a decade of sterile dialogue with the energy, health authorities, and the oil companies (Oxy and Pluspetrol Norte S.A.), as well as pressure exerted by local people on their leaders. This mobilization ended with an agreement with Pluspetrol and government authorities that would have been unlikely to reach otherwise.",304981587,,Dissertations & Theses," Lu, Graciela Maria MercedesLuMaria MercedesGracielaLu, Graciela Maria Mercedes",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1970816971 , 50966921 , 66569 , 9781109630886 , 1478791 , 1478791", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109630886, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304981587?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Latin American Studies , International Relations , Political science , Ethnic studies", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Corrientes+River+case%3A+Indigenous+people%27s+mobilization+in+response+to+oil+development+in+the+Peruvian+Amazon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lu%2C+Graciela+Maria+Mercedes&amp;isbn=9781109630886&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"286,"Connected, but to what? A case study of new media, migration, and transnational belonging in global Paris","Arjun Appadurai (1996) locates cross-border migrations of people and media as the ‘core’ of globalization’s complex connectedness. Scholarship at this core has shown that questions of belonging and identity can be closely related to media practices, and that media-production by people living outside of an originating ‘homeland’ involves strategic and multivalent processes that can lead to new ‘hybrid’ and transnational identities. However, in the large body of work that has developed at this nexus, a burgeoning group of migrants is almost completely omitted: middle class migrants who, whether as corporate professionals or cultural experience-seekers, or both, go from global city to global city, remaining just a few years in each site and weaving complicated social networks along the way. These people are unique to studies of migration because they are not a bounded ‘population’ group, are from ethnically and nationally diverse backgrounds, and their movements are characterized by continual migration. Such characteristics are outside the boundaries of traditional research conceptions that categorize migrants by ethnic, religious or national/regional heritage and often imagine a more stable and linear migration wherein people migrate from ‘country A’ to ‘country B’ to put down roots in the new land, even while continuing the connections to the homeland or with a Diaspora. This ethnographic dissertation takes the ‘global city’ of Paris as a case study, to interpret how a population of ‘international people’ comes together through combined use of online and offline mediated spaces. By accessing web-based groups such as those hosted by ‘meet-up.com,’ it’s possible to move to Paris, not know anybody, and have a social event to go to almost every night of the week. While certainly many people arrive in a foreign city and immediately immerse themselves in the local cohort of their co-nationals, this study focused on those who specifically sought to become a part of a broader ‘international community,’ by joining web groups thus-named. In the introduction to a collection of essays on contested identities, Caldas-Couthard &amp; Iedema (2008) write: ‘For the deterritorialized self, social coherence is pursued through more and more intense and dynamic forms of communication, seeking to create and recreate a sense of interactive place, however temporary’ (p. 2). My project analyzes a portal to that temporary community, where the floating self can touch down in a space of belonging Critical studies of migration and media have focused on important efforts to ‘provide a voice’ to marginalized migrant groups, but most have not taken into account the large and increasingly ethnically diverse population of middle class migrants also moving in transnational space. That privileged migrants remain ‘under the radar’ attests to the naturalized status of ‘elites’ both in academic and public discourse, a practice that overlooks an opportunity to develop new and broader frameworks for understanding social changes accompanying increased geographic mobility and the role of media use herein. Interestingly, my interpretations of the Paris international community did not indicate that its participants were ‘elite’ but rather that they were mainly middle class migrating people whose cultural capital (knowledge of several languages, repertoire of ‘experiences’ abroad, etc.) allowed them to demonstrate a certain ‘elite-ness’ that was not materially based. By contributing a new perspective on how new communications technologies shape and are shaped by social practices developed in the transnational spaces of globalization, as well as uncovering modes of belonging, experience, and practice that, while crossing previously-imagined boundaries, are also erecting new ones, this project provides broader understanding of the actual practices that make up a ‘global network society.’",304984379,,Dissertations & Theses," Polson, ErikaPolsonErikaPolson, Erika",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1904166031 , 49053451 , 66569 , 9781109459678 , 3380982 , 3380982", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109459678, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304984379?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications,, 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," Communication and the arts , Cosmopolitan professionals , France , Globalization , Globalization studies , Migration , Network society , New media , Paris , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Connected%2C+but+to+what%3F+A+case+study+of+new+media%2C+migration%2C+and+transnational+belonging+in+global+Paris&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Polson%2C+Erika&amp;isbn=9781109459678&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"287,Dark matter in b -boying cyphers: Race and global connection in hip hop,"This multi-sited, inter-disciplinary project analyzes the ubiquitous practice within breaking (or b-boying) culture of cyphering—improvisational and competitive dance circles. Through oral histories, participant observation, and live performance and archival analysis across the U.S. and parts of Europe from 2005 to 2009, this work focuses on the unseen elements of cyphers, sometimes manifesting as cultural knowledge, the import of history, or cypher ""energy"". In exchanges between dancers and in relationship to the surrounding spectators, cyphers cultivate a force that becomes their defining characteristic. While described in a number of ways—such as highs, spiritual connection, or energy—the physics concept of dark matter acts as an umbrella for its unseen, multi-dimensional, and material influences. Dark matter is the non-luminous material glue that holds together galaxies and ""appears"" only by way of its gravitational influence on surrounding visible matter. This project considers the multiple dimensions of competitive collaborations in relation to other collectivities, including diaspora and notions of the global. As cyphers perform multi-racial and transnational connection though movement, they act as resources to consider ideas of the whole that are attuned to internal differentiation and conflicting interests, particularly with respect to race and national difference. Chapter One examines the brief history, and the layers of meaning apparent in the unseen qualities of a single cypher. Chapter Two explores the changing cultural context of b-boying such that past historicizations of movement become a part of current struggles over cultural meaning. Battles remind us that the whole of b-boying is constituted through difference, akin to ""rhizomatic"" relations. Chapter Three compares the multiple depictions of the cypher's dark matter to similar forces within other African diasporic circles, demonstrating the overlapping cultural influences on b-boying movement and practices. Chapter Four examines the racial discourse on breaking in ‘80s media and in the contemporary moment among breakers in relationship to ideas of the dance's ""universal appeal."" Chapter Five provide thick descriptions of different field experiences, illustrating dimensions unaddressed in earlier analyses. Chapter Six examines b-boying as a social movement, wherein the virtual expansion of cyphering demands we consider global connection in a different manner.",304995567,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, Imani KaiJohnsonKaiImaniJohnson, Imani Kai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1952816191 , 48272961 , 66569 , 9781109561531 , 3389495 , 3389495", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109561531, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304995567?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," American studies , Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , B-boying , Cipher , Cyphers , Dark matter , Global connection , Hip-hop , Kinesthetic knowledge , Race",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dark+matter+in+b+-boying+cyphers%3A+Race+and+global+connection+in+hip+hop&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Imani+Kai&amp;isbn=9781109561531&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"288,Linguistic human rights and the education of language minority children: The case of the Japanese Brazilian returnees,"In recent years, more groups have been moving from location to location as technological advancements, economic interconnections, and interdependence among nation states have made this movement easier. Within this new environment, identities and nation state affiliations are in flux. These movements have also influenced the process of education. National education systems have been partially globalized through student and teacher mobility, deterritorializing of academic institutions, widespread policy borrowing, teaching English as a foreign/second language, and attempts to enhance the global dimension of curricula at secondary and post-secondary levels. The present study examines the Japanese Brazilian transnational community in Japan to determine whether a case for strong forms of bilingual education can be made in the context of linguistic human rights under Article 27 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Even though, the Japanese government ratified the Covenant in 1979, it has not been properly addressing the issue of bilingualism for linguistic minorities within Japanese society. Therefore, this study uses a general qualitative approach to offer explanations for the current sociohistorical and ethnolinguistic situation facing Japanese Brazilians in Japan. A critical cultural meta-ethnography was chosen for this investigation as it aims to provide an interpretive synthesis of qualitative research and other secondary sources. The contextual situation is explored to understand the development of Japanese Brazilians position both in Japan and in Brazil. First, I explain the development of the concepts linguistic human rights and ""Japaneseness"" as a racial group. Next, I examine the social, historical, and ethnolinguistic positions of Japan's ethnic and immigrant minorities and the position of their language in the Japanese public educational system in order to consider possible modes of action for educating Japanese Brazilian children.

The formation of the Polish women's movement identity,"By focusing on the unique forces that shape women’s movements in the post-communist context, this dissertation asks if the established geopolitical and theoretical frameworks, based on dichotomies between East and West, South and North can be utilized outside these locations. Or is a new framework necessary to fully understand the specific processes that are at work in the ambiguous “Second” World location? Chapter One, traces the individual and collective trajectories of Polish women’s movement to the 19 th century anti-partition mobilizations, the Second World War, the 1968 students’ liberation movement, the “Solidarity” labor union, and the 1990s Polish debate on abortion. Chapter Two identifies two elements as crucial for the unique development of transnational activism in the context of CEE: (1) its trajectory (“late” arrival into the international feminist space) and (2) the domination and critique of the EU “gender mainstreaming” paradigm within gender social justice discourses. Chapter Three recognizes the 1990s “abortion debate” became in impulse for the feminisms to move beyond the borders of the conservative nation state and bring the question of women’s sexual rights into the supranational political spaces and became a momentum for the emergence of versatile, vibrant mobilizations for gender and sexual justice in Poland and (e.g. European Court of Justice decision in the case of Alicja Tysiac against the Polish state). Chapter Four argues that secularism that had become, a necessary feminist response to violent and oppressive discourses that act to restrict women’s sexualities and rights, has also hindered feminist connectivity with religious women. In Poland a purification of the sexuality, emergence of the “political Catholicism” and “secular feminism” produced the subaltern, traveling identities of Catholic feminists. Chapter Five examines re-appropriation of the Anti-Semitic language of civic strangeness, historically represented by Polish Jews to the experience of sexual minorities. In conclusion this dissertation delineates two factors as decisive for current positionality of the “Second” world in the transnational feminist theory and practice: the rejection of Marxism as representing the colonial practices from the East (Russia, Soviet Union), the priotization of the supranational engagements with the European Union and Western Europe rather then Third World.",304996737,,Dissertations & Theses," Grabowska, MagdalenaGrabowskaMagdalenaGrabowska, Magdalena",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1933291011 , 49611871 , 66569 , 9781109529746 , 3387108 , 3387108", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109529746, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304996737?accountid=14496, 0733 Gender studies, 0733 Gender studies, 0733 Gender studies,, 0733 Gender studies, Gender studies," Social sciences , Cultural anthropology , Eastern Europe , European Union , Feminism , Poland , Political science , Postcolonial studies , Sociology , Transnational feminism , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Polish+feminism+between+East+and+West.+The+formation+of+the+Polish+women%27s+movement+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grabowska%2C+Magdalena&amp;isbn=9781109529746&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"290,Negotiating the middle: The construction of CAFTA -DR through discourse in the United States and Costa Rica,"This dissertation explores the ways in which the broader ideological positions of neoliberalism and “socialism for the 21 st century” pressure the discourse of CAFTA-DR in the U.S. and Costa Rica. Through a frame analysis of mainstream newspapers “of record,” The New York Times in the U.S. and La Nación in Costa Rica, along with independent and campaign discourse in Costa Rica, substantial reflection, negotiation, and rejection of the discourses of neoliberalism and “socialism for the 21 st century” was found. The discourse of the Times largely reflected the discourse of neoliberalism, and La Nación largely echoed the NY Times ’ framing. The Costa Rican discourse was more nuanced than the Times , illustrating the effect of both national cultural, and broader ideological pressures from below. Reflections of neoliberal discourse were found in La Nación ’s and the “yes” campaign’s framing of CAFTA-DR, as both sources constructed the agreement as progress and advancement, and good for Costa Rican consumers. Negotiation of neoliberal and “socialism for the 21 st century” discourses was also detected, with La Nación and the “yes” campaign negotiating a middle position by muting the strong individual rhetoric of neoliberalism and instead using more popular imagery of the “people” and “families.” The discourse of “socialism for the 21 st century” was also rejected, as the social movement in the street was constructed negatively, framed as social disorder and tied to notorious, foreign “communist” actors such as Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro. The independent media and the “no” campaign framing of CAFTA-DR through calls to, and images of, the social movement in the streets, reflected the more popular discourse of solidarity and participation that is encapsulated by “socialism for the 21 st century.” Both oppositional sources, however, balanced this reflection with a negotiated position that incorporated institutional resolution of CAFTA-DR (through the referendum, the legislature, etc.) and called for “free” trade with the United States. Despite this negotiation, evidence of a rejection of the strong neoliberal discourse of individualism was seen, as a main argument against CAFTA-DR was that it would benefit only a few, transnational and local capitalists.",304996830,,Dissertations & Theses," Comeforo, Kristin A.ComeforoA.KristinComeforo, Kristin A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1933250871 , 50114531 , 66569 , 9781109529630 , 3387097 , 3387097", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109529630, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304996830?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications",," 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," Journalism , Communication , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , CAFTA-DR , Costa Rica , Frame analysis , Free trade , Globalization , News discourse , Social movements , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Negotiating+the+middle%3A++The+construction+of+CAFTA+-DR+through+discourse+in+the+United+States+and+Costa+Rica&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Comeforo%2C+Kristin+A.&amp;isbn=9781109529630&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"291,Sacred changes: Multiracial alliances &amp;amp; community transformation among Asian American churches in the U.S.,"The United States has remained fragmented across racial lines for over two centuries and religious institutions have offered little progress in bridging this racial divide. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. noted this concern observing that ""eleven o'clock Sunday morning is the most segregated hour in America."" At the dawn of the 21st century however, a growing number of multiracial congregations are emerging and Asian American evangelicals are among those leading the movement. This phenomenon is surprising given that Asian Americans have been typically characterized as politically conservative (often apolitical) and culturally insular, primarily interested in the immediate concerns of their ethnic communities. American Evangelicals on the other hand have been associated with political and theological conservatism as well as racial homogeneity. Yet, a growing number of Asian American evangelical churches across the country are expanding their racial boundaries to transition their panethnic congregations into multiracial ones and mobilize their congregants into social action. This project asks why, how and for what purpose racial and political change occurs within ethnically and religiously conservative organizations, and how these changes impact American civil society. Based on five years of ethnographic research conducted at three Multiracial Asian American Churches (MAACs) in Los Angeles, the project investigates processes of multiracial formation by analyzing the ways in which the unique racial identity and racial positioning of Asian Americans in conjunction with the social, economic and spiritual capital of their churches, inform particular practices of multiracial coalition building and social justice advocacy in the local and global community. Findings reveal that post-immigrant Asian Americans utilize flexible racial identities to build multiracial alliances with African Americans, Latinos and Whites in the U.S. MAACs promote rhetoric of ""progressive"" social politics in the church, yet in practice participate in moderate democratic forms of civic engagement. While their mobilization efforts are not radical, they are still significant as MAACs use their institutional structures to rapidly organize Asian Americans efficiently, en mass, and on a consistent and long-term basis--more so than any other Asian American community activist group. Moreover, the findings suggest that MAACs are ""the"" primary space through which upwardly mobile second-through-fourth generation Asian Americans are politically mobilized. The project contends that the mobilization of Asian Americans through multiracial congregations represents the start of new broad-based social movement--one that is shifting the religio-political landscape of the United States.",304997238,,Dissertations & Theses," Yonemoto, Karen L.YonemotoL.KarenYonemoto, Karen L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1953732961 , 44046231 , 66569 , 9781109562767 , 3389590 , 3389590", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109562767, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304997238?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Religion , American studies , Ethnic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Asian-Americans , Civic engagement , Evangelical church , Multiracial , Social justice , Theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sacred+changes%3A+Multiracial+alliances+%26amp%3B+community+transformation+among+Asian+American+churches+in+the+U.S.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yonemoto%2C+Karen+L.&amp;isbn=9781109562767&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"292,Rewiring Kenneth Burke for the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century: Hizb ut -Tahrir's social movement rhetoric and online quest for the caliphate,"Chapter 1, “Introduction and Overview: Changing the Tools,” introduces my dissertation as an attempt to answer two sets of calls: calls for Burkean scholarship on social movements to be updated and calls for case studies of online rhetoric. I explain how social movements have been among the most important users of the Web and I introduce the subject of my dissertation, Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain (HTB). Chapter 2, “Social Movement Rhetoric Online: How Form is Formed,” conceptualizes a way to meet the challenge of updating Burkean methods to better understand social movement rhetorics created, disseminated, and received online. I examine the Web on its own terms, tracing its origins and blending insights from new media scholarship and rhetorical scholarship. I introduce and examine relevant Burkean rhetorical concepts, including symbolic action/nonsymbolic motion and rhetorical form. I argue that previous rhetorical scholarship on social movements, while valuable, has omitted the media-specific analysis necessary to understand the Web as a rhetorical event. Chapter 3, “Rewiring Kenneth Burke,” maps a rhetorical understanding of the Web as a vast global hypertext. I develop a critical tool, a three-layered heuristic, to examine the Web as a whole experience. That tool blends the material specificities of the Web with rhetorical form by considering “Behind the Screen, Off the Screen, and On the Screen.” This three-layered heuristic complicates our rhetorical readings of websites as websites , as mediated human drama and supplies a more sensitive means of reading rhetorical context and symbolic action. Chapter 4, “The Change Needs to be Khilafah ,” applies the heuristic developed in the third chapter to examine a wide range of artifacts from HTB's online rhetoric surrounding the proposed ban. I use a case study of HTB's online rhetoric in the two years following the 7/7 bombing and proposed ban to test that heuristic and to show its usefulness for “rewiring” Burkean methods for understanding social movement rhetoric.

The first two chapters explore the material and representational systems of production that established The Coca-Cola Company as a global business and cultural icon: international franchise bottling and pattern advertising. Through these closely interrelated systems, the Company strove to establish itself and its products as central forces in the lives of the world's workers, communities and consumers. However, in dialetical response to the Company's growing global impact, and its powerful ties the broader reconfigurations of the second half of the twentieth century, activists and social movements seized on its operations, commodities and brand images as vehicles through which to challenge the injustices of daily life under global capitalism. The subsequent three chapters of the dissertation explore three of the most powerful challenges waged against the multinational corporation in the twentieth century—nationalist, labor and environmental. Chapter 3 treats India's threat of “Indianization” of Coca-Cola's financial and intellectual capital in the late 1970s. Chapter 4 examines the struggles of Coca-Cola workers in the context of neoliberal reform and violence in Colombia in the 1990s–2000s. Chapter 5 explores consumer and peasant activism around the contamination and expropriation of water resources linked to Coca-Cola in the 2000s. These struggles against the corporation both challenged and depended on The Coca-Cola Company's multinational material and symbolic systems, as activists used its commodities and images to organize national and transnational resistances to the corporation. The power of these transnational challenges was reflected in the Company's response to them, as Coca-Cola developed new discourses and practices under the banner of “global corporate social responsibility,” a development treated in the dissertation's final chapter.",305039975,,Dissertations & Theses," Ciafone, Amanda MarieCiafoneMarieAmandaCiafone, Amanda Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1899221031 , 47237561 , 66569 , 9781109205589 , 3361892 , 3361892", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109205589, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305039975?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0454 Management , 0582 Modern history , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0323 American studies , 0454 Management , 0582 Modern history , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0323 American studies , 0454 Management , 0582 Modern history , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0323 American studies , 0454 Management , 0582 Modern history , 0703 Organizational behavior"," American studies , Management , Modern history , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Coca-Cola , Colombia , Global corporation , India , Multinational corporations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Counter-Cola%3A+A+multinational+history+of+challenges+to+the+global+corporation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ciafone%2C+Amanda+Marie&amp;isbn=9781109205589&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"295,"Radicalism, race and national identity in Britain, 1958-1972","Between 1958 and 1972 Britain underwent important social and political changes internationally and domestically. Ideas about what it meant to be British were in flux and were the subject of debate and conflict within every part of British society. In the space between politicians and the general public a group of organisations, or movements, was developing and growing in importance. During the 1960s some of the most important of these groups were the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the National Union of Students and the Northern Irish civil rights movement. They each had a unique history, objective and character. But they were also each engaged in understanding, articulating and shaping what it meant to be British. This thesis explores how CND, AAM, the NUS and the Northern Irish civil rights movement articulated ideas of British identity, both in terms of its external or global influence and in terms of its domestic character. It also looks at how these organisations developed a common and often linked political view that connected questions like nuclear disarmament and human rights with ideas of social justice at home. Over the course of the 1960s the conviction of these groups that Britain continued to have a unique and central international position was weakened, but did not disappear. There was also a remarkable level of continuity in their assertion of British characteristics. These groups clearly became more pessimistic about the state of British society in these years, but did not lose hope in the British people and their ability to change their society for the better. The connecting of disparate issues, from nuclear weapons to racial equality and civil rights was something that most of these groups struggled with into the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, however, the need for a unified political view and action was recognised by each of these organisations. This work explores British national identity in the 1960s in areas that have been previously overlooked: extra-parliamentary activism over disparate radical questions. It takes subjects such as immigration, race and rights as ways of thinking about that articulation of national identity.",305041538,,Dissertations & Theses," Burkett, JodiBurkettJodiBurkett, Jodi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1934994591 , 49152991 , 66569 , 9780494540145 , NR54014 , NR54014", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494540145, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305041538?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," Black history , European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Great Britain , National identity , Race , Radicalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Radicalism%2C+race+and+national+identity+in+Britain%2C+1958-1972&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burkett%2C+Jodi&amp;isbn=9780494540145&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"296,Emerging biocultural agrifood relations: Local maize networks in Mexico,"A unique constellation of agricultural trade and biotechnology policies, the historical and cultural importance of maize, and strong social movements make Mexico a fertile site for exploring contemporary agricultural and culinary transformations. Neoliberal policy shifts and new agricultural biotechnologies in Mexico have galvanized social movements “in defense of maize” and led to new strategies for marketing maize at the local level. Building on the political ecology and food studies literature, this dissertation proposes that these efforts represent emerging biocultural agrifood relations. Exploring three core tensions in the literature—nature and culture, the local and the global, and markets and social movements—the research argues that the neoliberal context and local food initiatives are mutually constituted. Case studies of the Itanoní Tortillería and the Nuestro Maíz projects examine efforts to create shortened tortilla supply chains that provide locally grown maize to local consumers. Beyond linking producers to consumers, these short tortilla supply chains are connected to transnational social movements working on agrodiversity conservation, food and agriculture issues. The case studies demonstrate the challenges of and potential for biocultural agrifood relations, as well as the creative strategies used by such initiatives to build local markets, educate consumers and link to broader social movements.",305045340,,Dissertations & Theses," Baker, Lauren E.BakerE.LaurenBaker, Lauren E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1883587841 , 48942001 , 66569 , 9780494516720 , NR51672 , NR51672", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494516720, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305045340?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0366 Geography , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0366 Geography , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0366 Geography , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Geography , Agricultural economics"," Social sciences , Agrifood relations , Biocultural , Maize networks , Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emerging+biocultural+agrifood+relations%3A+Local+maize+networks+in+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baker%2C+Lauren+E.&amp;isbn=9780494516720&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"297,"Working through skin: Making leather, making a multicultural Japan","Working through Skin examines labor and minority issues in Japan, in a transnational context. In particular, it focuses on the Japanese leather industry and the political movement of people associated with this industry. In the past three decades this group, the Buraku, have gained increased international recognition as a minority, which allows their political organizations to put new pressure on the Japanese government. At the same time, though, the forms of stigmatized labor – such as leatherwork and meat production – that mark these people as a minority are leaving Japan, following cheaper labor costs to China and India. Political successes in arguing about labor, then, are coming at the moment that labor is transforming dramatically. Based on 28-months of ethnographic research with the leading Buraku political organization and a leather tannery in eastern Tokyo, Working through Skin argues that, in the Buraku situation, labor is shifting from a set of stigmatized practices to a social identity, and that the work of making leather is being replaced by the work of making a multicultural Japan. The dissertation develops a theory of the “labor of multiculturalism” that addresses how new arguments about labor are being made in the language of multiculturalism and contextualizes this theory within global circulations of industrial capital and multicultural political action. My dissertation focuses on how the Buraku liberation movement conducts politics in this changing situation. Treating their international efforts as communicative processes of self-redefinition, I examine what the Buraku political organization mobilizes around, how they mobilize, and how they justify their claims. In order to provide such an analysis, I explore three themes over the five substantive chapters of the dissertation: the material and symbolic practices involved in creating or not creating signs of Buraku identity; the interplay between choice and obligation in Buraku political strategy presently and historically; and finally the affective dimensions of international solidarity – both mediated by the UN and not. Most directly, the first two chapters address the first theme, chapters two and three address the second, and chapters four and five address the final theme. Across the work, I articulate a theory of the labor of multiculturalism to characterize the current Buraku situation and speculate on the co-constitution of multiculturalism and neoliberal capitalism.",305049649,,Dissertations & Theses," Hankins, Joseph DoyleHankinsDoyleJosephHankins, Joseph Doyle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1859327291 , 47238811 , 66569 , 9781109313215 , 3369343 , 3369343", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109313215, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305049649?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Circulation , Globalization , Japan , Materiality , Multiculturalism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Working+through+skin%3A+Making+leather%2C+making+a+multicultural%0AJapan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hankins%2C+Joseph+Doyle&amp;isbn=9781109313215&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"298,Islam as ideology: The politics of the Islamic revival in post-Soviet Central Asia,"The Islamic Revival in post-Soviet Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) offers a rich case study concerning the role of Islamism in international politics.

However, these communities also adapt to certain aspects of globalization as a means to maintain and sustain their cooperatives by drawing on the interconnectedness of systems of communication.

More than half a million women die related to pregnancy and childbirth each year. One in four maternal deaths worldwide occur in India. This study asks, given two Indian states with comparable socio-cultural contexts and economic indicators, what explains differing progress for maternal mortality reduction? Comparative analysis of the policy processes in each state provides insights to the research question and suggests the need for more holistic frameworks for analyzing policy processes than currently exist. Comparative case studies draw on more than 140 interviews with health policy experts, managers and service delivery personnel in the two Indian states, as well as with representatives of domestic and international NGOs and donor agencies over three months in 2007; numerous national and state government reports; policy and program documents; and reports and documents from international donor and nongovernmental organizations to triangulate data relevant to answering the research question. The findings suggest that differing social historical influences in each state; worldviews, priorities and degrees of power among major political parties; strength and ideas of key policy actors; and capacity and norms in the concerned public health bureaucracies shaped variation in availability and access to publicly provided safe motherhood services in the two states, especially for more vulnerable groups (e.g. women with lower economic, educational and social status). The results suggest a need for more holistic frameworks for analyzing policy processes—frameworks that highlight the influence of such social historical influences as major social movements and other feats of social organization (e.g. colonialism) as they shape conditions of the political environment, the power of policy actors and ideas, and organizational structures that shape subsequent policy processes. In doing so, the study identifies a neglected set of variables in historical social organization, refines our understanding of how the political environment matters, and presents political-bureaucratic actors and ideas as a category of factors that bridges policy and management to better reflect the overall set of causal relationships that influence policy outcomes.",305084175,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Stephanie LynetteSmithLynetteStephanieSmith, Stephanie Lynette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1904252461 , 49551691 , 66569 , 9781109470741 , 3381604 , 3381604", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109470741, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305084175?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy",," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," Public health , Public administration , Public policy"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Health policy , India , Maternal mortality , Public policy , Safe motherhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+policy+%26amp%3B+maternal+mortality+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Stephanie+Lynette&amp;isbn=9781109470741&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"301,"Migration in the age of globalization: Transnationalism, identity, social class, and education of Latino families","This dissertation addresses the connections between migration, identity, social class, and education, and how these relations create contemporary transnational individuals. I closely examine how Latino migrant families live their every day lives within a transnational context. Specifically, I compare the migration experience of middle and poor class Latinos from varying nationality and look at how they live and narrate concepts of belonging, ethnic identity, and social class. In addition, I examine how families and schools give advantages and/or disadvantages to Latino migrant children. Over a 12-month period, I conducted in-depth ethnographic case studies of 4 Latino families of varying nationalities and social class. The research design includes interviews with family members and school teachers, field observations at homes and schools, document collection, and field notes. The comparative ethnographic design of this research offers a detailed understanding of the processes through which families of diverse background cope with migration. This work shows how Latino families simultaneously engage in different social practices within multiple locations. In particular, it shows how social class is being transformed by to the movement of people and the shifting global economy. The findings reveal that there are important differences in how Latinos of different background settle and adapt to a new country, create networks of support, navigate the educational system, and relate to other ethnic and racial groups, including other Latinos. It also uncovers that differences in uses and access to technology leads to inequality between schools and families; this digital divide is in many ways related to race and ethnicity. In conclusion, I point out the need to adopt a multidimensional approach when studying transnational migrants. This approach helps us understand the often contradictory set of forces operating in these families. Implications of this study highlight the need for teachers and schools to look at the culture and the home environment of their students. The findings show that schools need to be active participants in the development of parental involvement programs that take into account the families’ cultural background. In addition, schools need to look more closely at the instruction on uses of technology needed to compete in the globalized world. For policy-makers, this study reveals that a new type of nation building is occurring; one that is based on multiple belongings and loyalties. Thus, this study suggests that the United States should adopt a migration agenda based on the possibility of having double loyalty , where migrants living in the U.S. are allowed to feel a sense of responsibility and duty to several countries.",305086791,,Dissertations & Theses," Crespo Sancho, CatalinaCrespo SanchoCatalinaCrespo Sancho, Catalina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1786258721 , 44497531 , 66569 , 9781109157024 , 3356018 , 3356018", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109157024, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305086791?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Educational sociology , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Education , Ethnicity , Families , Latino , Migration , Social stratification , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migration+in+the+age+of+globalization%3A+Transnationalism%2C+identity%2C+social+class%2C+and+education+of+Latino+families&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Crespo+Sancho%2C+Catalina&amp;isbn=9781109157024&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"302,A perspective of global capitalism,"Since the 1970s, the political-economic structure of global society has undergone drastic restructuring. International political economy is concerned with providing explanations for these changes. This thesis will provide an alternative view of international relations that is often marginalized in the mainstream literature. It will be argued that global society needs to be understood under the historical context of capitalism and the class relations that stem from it. Central to this argument is a Gramscian derived articulation of hegemony. Thus, hegemony will be conceptualized in this thesis as a transnational class that governs over global society through consent and coercion. While hegemony is usually understood as a dominant state or a collection of powerful states, the state-centric perspective that has persisted in international political economy will be rejected. Moreover, the driving force behind the reorientation of production, finance, institutions, ideas and social relations in recent decades is a transnational class movement of capitalism or what will be referred to in this thesis as neo-liberal hegemony. From this perspective, neo-liberal hegemony can be understood as a class configuration of productive forces, institutions, transnational firms, intellectuals, political elites and most importantly the role of ideas.",305087346,,Dissertations & Theses," Soller, JamesSollerJamesSoller, James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1975266021 , 51053481 , 66569 , 9781109638455 , 1474415 , 1474415", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109638455, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305087346?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Political science , International law"," Social sciences , Capitalism , Class , Globalization , Gramsci's theory , Hegemony , Washington consensus",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+perspective+of+global+capitalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soller%2C+James&amp;isbn=9781109638455&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"303,"Delinking as resistance to transnationalized corporatism: A study of state society relations in Mexico, 1982-2006","State-society relations in Mexico have changed over the past thirty years from state corporatism (SC) to ‘transnationalized corporatism’ (TC). Driving the transition from SC to TC has been the state's adoption of neoliberal political-economic reforms under the tutelage of the International Financial Institutions and the World Trade Organization. Situated in a Marxist account of Mexico's capitalist relations of production, this work reports, analyzes and explains the various strategies employed by a purposive sample of non-state actors—unions, opposition political parties, NGOs, election movements, gremial movements and the Zapatista movement—in responding to the new order of TC. Because of its unique ‘delinking’ response to TC, the Zapatista movement is examined in detail. The dissertation's empirical findings are that although corporatism has declined in scope it has persisted in a transnationalized form; that in response non-state actors have variously adopted a range of strategies including maintaining (modified) relations with the state, forming independent unions, augmenting the scope of their demands, making coalitions, substituting for the state's withdrawal from service provision and seeking autonomy from the state altogether. Theoretically, ‘integrative’ (corporatist or anti-corporatist) or ‘delinking’ (non-corporatist) response strategies are distinguished in relation to their accommodation to TC and the social relations of production. The persistence of corporatism as an entrenched feature of Mexican state-society relations undermines the view that Mexico is a pluralist democracy. Finally, the Zapatista delinking strategy is compared with that of Hugo Chavez in relation to US imperialism and the deglobalizing efforts of the Argentinean factory takeover movement. Keywords .

In this movement, sport is formally recognized, by organizations including the United Nations, to hold a utility in advancing social development, particularly in Low and Middle Income Countries. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 former interns from the International Development through Sport program organized and operated by Commonwealth Games Canada (CGC). CGC's program places qualified candidates with a sport and/or health partner organization in a Commonwealth nation in Africa or the Caribbean for a minimum of 8 months to facilitate the use of sport and play to meet development goals. A theoretical framework informed by sport sociology, post-colonial theory and international development studies was employed to investigate how and why sport is used in development, the socio-political consequences of SDP and the implications of sending young Canadians to serve as sport development facilitators and leaders. Framed within neo-Gramscian politics, the methodology centred on the Foucauldian subject as both the participant subject imagined within the SDP movement, and the subject position of the SDP volunteer. The results offer evidence with which to argue that despite popular rhetoric regarding the political transcendence of sport in relation to its utility in development, the use of sport as a development tool is susceptible to the logic of contemporary neoliberalism whereby underprivileged people are primarily understood to lack the means to participate effectively in market capitalism. As such, SDP is beholden to the same political challenges that face international development as a whole. With respect to the subject position of the intern, internships such as those organized by the CGC program, may position young Canadians in a way that secures their transnational innocence and disavows relations of dominance, both historical and contemporary, the ethics of which require careful consideration.

The practice developed as a dynamic popular, and public form of history of the everyday lives of ordinary people, which encouraged people to take the writing of their family history into their own hands, and contribute, with their historical work, to highlighting the roles of their families and of ordinary people to the history of the development of Pennsylvania, and ultimately of the nation. This development was supported by the growth, standardization, and professionalization of a library and archival system that facilitated the development of family history as a form of self-education and leisure-time pursuit. At the same time, the movement reflected the racial foundations and social boundaries of the progressive concepts of “the people” and “the public.” During the late nineteenth and first decades of the twentieth centuries, family history, as a public practice, was promoted and practiced almost exclusively among those people, who traced their descent to groups of white ancestors from Northern and Western Europe, who had immigrated to Pennsylvania during the colonial (provincial) period. While promoting a concept of a pluralist people, this pluralism at the same time reflected hierarchies based on race, religion, and chronological precedence. To situate the development of the definitions of “the people” that shaped the practice more broadly, this study also analyzes its development in a transnational context, with a particular focus on the development of relationships between family historians pursuing Pennsylvania German family history in the United States, and promoters of the pursuit in Germany. During National Socialism, German scholars attempted to use genealogy, including Pennsylvania-German genealogy, as an ideological tool in defining and implementing an ideal of the nation and the people that was shaped by völkisch ideology that defined the nation on the basis of purity of descent. After World War II, family historians in Germany and the United States began to co-operate under a regionalist umbrella in the spirit of German-American reconciliation and friendship, while remaining largely silent about the history of genealogy during the Third Reich. This study ends in the late 1960s, when the concept of “Pennsylvania and its people” was being re-defined, and when the racial foundations of the concept were coming under challenge, changing the ideological context of the practice of family history and paving the way for the genealogy boom of the 1970s. Thus, this dissertation not only documents the development of the practice of Pennsylvania German family history as a form of history of the everyday lives of ordinary people from 1891-1966, but also how and in what regional, national, and international context these people defined themselves and their family histories.",305130282,,Dissertations & Theses," Hering, KatharinaHeringKatharinaHering, Katharina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1901790791 , 47696331 , 66569 , 9781109443011 , 3377700 , 3377700", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109443011, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305130282?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0399 Library science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0399 Library science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0399 Library science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0399 Library science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , American history , Library science , Ethnic studies , Families & family life , Pennsylvania"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Archives , Family history , Genealogy , Historiography , Libraries , Pennsylvania-German , Public history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CWe+are+all+makers+of+history%E2%80%9D%3A+People+and+publics+in+the+practice+of+Pennsylvania+-German+family+history%2C+1891%E2%80%931966&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hering%2C+Katharina&amp;isbn=9781109443011&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Ethnic NewsWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"306,"Globalization, local movement and transnational networks","This dissertation examines the activism of the Amazonian indigenous peoples in Ecuador who have resisted neoliberal state policies that have spurred the destruction of their culture and homelands through the process of oil extraction. Their messages of resistance have diffused through borders and facilitated the creation of links with transnational organizations in the U.S. that are linked to this Ecuadorian movement. This research examines both the local level and the transnational level of activism. Transnationally, the indigenous have formed ties with organizations based in the US that work to raise global awareness about the plight of the Ecuadorian indigenous. This research asks: How are the indigenous peoples in Ecuador’s Amazon organized? How have the indigenous peoples’ organizations framed resistances at the local level and why do the frames resonate locally? Further, what frames have been deployed at the transnational level by US based organizations and why do they resonate globally? Using a two-sited research design, qualitative data was collected from 44 semi-structured interviews and organizational documents, and participation observation. Observing and working closely with six Amazonian organizations and three US-based organizations, forty-four interviews were conducted Forty-four interviews were conducted The two sites are in Ecuador and the U.S. Such a research design facilitated the exploration of transnational connections between movement/movement organizations across sites and from both ends; rather than the usually presented view that is from the Global North alone, an approach that often overlooks the power relations involved in the North-South dynamic. This research indicates that local level indigenous peoples have adopted organizational structures that can be classified as hybrid in form. Frames deployed at the local level are culturally relevant for community members. They use conceptual understandings of indigenous livelihood, synergy with community and the environment to explain and mobilize local communities. Frames adopted at the transnational level by the US-based groups used universal norms of environmental conservation and human rights to explain injustices and mobilize their supporters. These frames resonate transnationally with the intended audience because they employ universal norms. The project contributes to our understanding of transnational movements. The research on localized indigenous resistance and the connections it has with transnational organizations adds to the theoretical understanding of localized resistances within the global antiglobalization movement and mechanisms involved in the diffusion of frames across the local and transnational. This provides a ‘bottom-up’ perspective of transnational linkages in the social movement literature. Research on resistances and collective action of marginalized groups in the developing world, such as the indigenous in the Amazonian region, are often considered peripheral to discussions in the discipline in the global north. Considering broader impacts, this study enables us to reconsider our conceptualizations of resistances that may be embedded in specific contexts but yet may have a bearing on our theoretical understandings of organizing movements. The outcomes from this study will also raise public awareness about indigenous peoples and their movements to challenge injustices.",366652177,,Dissertations & Theses," Williford, Beth AnnWillifordAnnBethWilliford, Beth Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2056279821 , 52710201 , 66569 , 9781109769463 , 3403432 , 3403432", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109769463, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/366652177?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Social structure , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Ecuador , Globalization , Indigenous peoples , Transnational movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Globalization%2C+local+movement+and+transnational+networks&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williford%2C+Beth+Ann&amp;isbn=9781109769463&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"307,Globalized movements and local politics: Framing natural resource conflicts in Thailand,"Marginalized small farmers in northern Thailand face insecure tenure, landlessness and conflicts with other users and the state over the natural resources necessary to their livelihoods. The struggles to address those insecurities have taken a variety of forms, conditioned by globalized movements and local political opportunities, none of which have been entirely satisfactory in achieving their ends. In the ""green"" version, farmers on state lands highlighted their resource management and conservation strategies, and attempted to place themselves and stakeholders in the politics of forest management. In the ""red"" version, farmers pressed the state to live up to its responsibility to ensure productive use of agricultural land by directly challenging existing tenure relationships through land occupation. Initially confirming Keck and Sikkink (1998), they were successful in writing farmers into the conservation debate as stakeholders with the support of local and transnational allies. This position was highly constrained, and challenged by a coalition of globally-connected conservationists, forestry officials, and competing farmers. By highlighting some elements of their situation at the expense of others, farmers were able to do the conceptual and ideological work of identity articulation (Li 2000), and global framing (Tarrow 2005), but they could not defend the resultant construction from the conservation movement. Farmers challenging the state in class terms were constrained by the danger of anti-communist state repression and the difficulty of courting cross-class allies from that position, but were able to form positive and mutually-beneficial horizontal relationships with other farmers and poor people domestically and internationally. The power of these coalitions to effect social change locally was limited by the domestic opportunity structure, but the potential avenues for scaling up to the regional and international level through the global justice movement were more numerous. From their class based-position, these farmers were moving into sustainable agriculture and reaching out to ""green"" consumers. This suggests that it is more effective for farmers to build environmental sustainability into livelihood concerns than to add livelihood to an established environmentalist agenda.",519157740,,Dissertations & Theses," York, Jodi ChristineYorkChristineJodiYork, Jodi Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2066034341 , 49570921 , 66569 , 9781124032238 , 3411246 , 3411246", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781124032238, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/519157740?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure," Social sciences , Environmental politics , Farmer's movements , Social movements , Thailand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Globalized+movements+and+local+politics%3A+Framing+natural+resource+conflicts+in+Thailand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=York%2C+Jodi+Christine&amp;isbn=9781124032238&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"308,"Postwar evangelical social concern: Evangelical identity and the modes and limits of social engagement, 1945-1960","The early post World War II era served as a formative period for the American evangelical movement in terms of defining the manner and methods of its social engagement for the remainder of the twentieth century. During these years, three main factors influenced the development of an evangelical ethos of social engagement: the historic evangelical emphasis on conversion, a renewed impetus toward social action among some evangelicals, and evangelicals' experience in the world. Throughout its history, the evangelical movement has been characterized by a desire and effort to see others converted. In fact, this evangelical impulse toward conversion is at the heart of evangelical identity and subsequently, evangelical unity. During the 1940s and 1950s, all manner of American Protestants who emphasized conversion as the foundational religious experience were drawn together in a spirit of cooperation. At the same time, a renewed social concern percolated among evangelicals as their corporate experience exposed them to suffering and need. While evangelical elites sought to develop a cohesive, unified evangelical social theology, others (mainly ecclesiastical leaders), aimed at ""doing something"" about it. Even though elites ultimately failed to develop a cohesive, unified evangelical social theology due to the minimalist theological orientation of evangelicalism as a movement, their theological efforts contributed to the growing ethos of social concern that was rippling through evangelical cooperative venues. In some instances (e.g. global poverty, anti-communism), this growing ethos and impetus towards social engagement resulted in unified action and goals as experiences of suffering were mediated to rank-and-file evangelicals. Ensuing efforts were distinctively oriented around historic evangelical foci, particularly efforts towards conversion. In other instances (e.g. the early civil rights movement), evangelical social concern faltered as the evangelical emphasis on conversion—in both its experiential and theological aspects—failed to provide a suitable substrate from which to develop a workable, unified, specifically evangelical solution. In every instance, positions codified in this period explain later developments within American evangelicalism, particularly regarding the modes and limits of social engagement.",734726721,,Dissertations & Theses," Mullin, Miles S., IIMullinS.MilesIIMullin, Miles S., II",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2099178421 , 53698171 , 66569 , 9781124106724 , 3416174 , 3416174", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781124106724, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/734726721?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations"," Religious history , American history , International Relations , Evangelicalism , Social psychology , Social identity"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Civirl rights movement , Evangelical identity , Postwar , Religious identity , Social engagement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Postwar+evangelical+social+concern%3A+Evangelical+identity+and+the+modes+and+limits+of+social+engagement%2C+1945-1960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mullin%2C+Miles+S.%2C+II&amp;isbn=9781124106724&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"309,Public Liturgy as the Paradigm for Social Transformation: Shifting a Local Congregation from Sanctuary to Street,"This professional project examines methods used in two United Church of Christ congregations in Southern California to engage in public liturgy based on local and international models of social justice ministries. The ontology of social transformation in the 20 th Century forged by religious institutions, civil rights organizations, and progressive social movements is analyzed through the lens of prominent and contemporary individuals whose contributions determined the actual impact on societies. This project's purpose is to recognize the importance of elevating local issues that resonant across traditional barriers of race, class, gender, and geography to inspire corporate imagination that can motivate and connect disaffected persons to the plight of the ""other"" in societies. Specifically, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and the American Civil Rights movement, the Rev. Dr. Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Germany's Confessing Church during World War II, Cardinal Jaime Sin and the People Power Movement in the Philippines during the waning reign of Ferdinand Marcos, and Mahatma Gandhi's demonstration of his satyagraha philosophy in India provide a portrait of local actions that created historical, global events. That is the backdrop used to design modest opportunities for the two congregations in this project to deliberately organize and utilize easily accessible resources to address issues within their targeted service areas. This project intends to operate within the framework of those congregations situated in urban and suburban communities where worship focuses on a narrow understanding of traditional religious practices. The project concludes with a critique of the roles individuals play within congregations to embody their religious beliefs through promoting events within the sanctuary of the churches and outside those walls on the streets where they invite and involve public safety personnel, professionals, politicians, and a variety of other religious groups to participate. Finally, newspaper articles and media coverage of events sponsored by the two congregations are included as examples of the churches' effective presence in the Public Square toward shifting from placid sanctuaries to turbulent relevance in the streets.",808438866,,Dissertations & Theses," Cribbs, Arthur Lawrence, Jr.CribbsLawrenceArthurJr.Cribbs, Arthur Lawrence, Jr.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2196025301 , 55739721 , 66569 , 9781124328447 , 3431621 , 3431621", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781124328447, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/808438866?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology"," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology"," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology",," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology"," Ethics , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Liturgy , Social justice ministries , United Church of Christ",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+Liturgy+as+the+Paradigm+for+Social+Transformation%3A+Shifting+a+Local+Congregation+from+Sanctuary+to+Street&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cribbs%2C+Arthur+Lawrence%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9781124328447&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"310,Expanding corporate responsibility: The role of business in creating sustainable peace and security,"Foreign corporations have provided significant investment toward the economic and social progress of developing countries, but the impact of their presence and operations is often a mixed blessing. In many cases, the actions or inactions of multinational corporations (MNCs) contributed directly or indirectly to human rights abuses and fueled violent conflict in areas at high-risk for civil war. The 1990s saw a prevalence of human rights issues involving corporations, from an unflagging system of apartheid in South Africa to the exposure of child and forced labor in factories and dangerous industries to violent conflict in the oil fields of the Niger Delta. In the same time period, civil conflict and civil war were on the rise, often in weak or failing states with heavy dependence on corporate extraction of their natural resources for revenue. International attention, including increasing pressure from activist shareholders and global social movements, has thus over the last 30 years shifted toward expanding the responsibility and role of MNCs in many non-economic areas of civil society, including the protection of human rights and conflict prevention. The desire for enhanced engagement by corporations has been driven by several dynamic situations: (1) the changing nature of conflict is challenging traditional conflict resolution methods; (2) weak and failed nation states are changing attitudes toward the principle of national sovereignty; and (3) globalization and expanding market economies mean that business has greater influence and interests in international affairs and global stability. Two new concepts emerged to address these global challenges: corporate social responsibility (CRS) and conflict prevention. Both frameworks define an interest and need for corporations to take greater care and responsibility with regard to the impacts of their operations, and go further in asking corporations to use their influence to address human rights issues and to engage in peacebuilding and establishing security outside of their gates. Voluntary codes of conduct based on international standards have evolved to address a broad range of corporate investment issues and provide guidelines for MNC behavior. However, none of the traditional instruments provides a common framework for MNC behavior or guidelines for political engagement with regard to human rights, or address the unique challenges of doing business in countries with high risk for conflict. The lines have become blurred regarding responsibilities of corporations and those of the state and other actors, and national sovereignty principles are often in conflict with changing international norms. This thesis explores current approaches to CSR and conflict prevention to understand whether new and better rules are needed for MNC political involvement in promoting human rights and securing peace, and if so, how to define a new political role and practical guidelines for MNCs.",822646680,,Dissertations & Theses," Webb, Susan E.WebbE.SusanWebb, Susan E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2231240961 , 49710621 , 66569 , 9781124379913 , 1483586 , 1483586", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781124379913, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822646680?accountid=14496," 0310 Business administration , 0394 Ethics , 0563 Peace Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0310 Business administration , 0394 Ethics , 0563 Peace Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0310 Business administration , 0394 Ethics , 0563 Peace Studies , 0601 International Relations",," 0310 Business administration , 0394 Ethics , 0563 Peace Studies , 0601 International Relations"," Business administration , Ethics , Peace Studies , International Relations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Expanding+corporate+responsibility%3A+The+role+of+business+in+creating+sustainable+peace+and+security&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Webb%2C+Susan+E.&amp;isbn=9781124379913&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"311,"East meets West: The politics of human rights activism in Turkey, 1980–2007","This study explores the evolution of Turkey’s grass-roots human rights movement over a period of three decades, paying particularly close attention to inter-organizational relations between Islamist and secular organizations. It asks, why and under what conditions did seemingly opposed organizations develop into an ideologically and socially more cohesive human rights movement? Which, if any, conflicting human rights perspectives blocked cooperation between Islamists and secularists, and how were these differences reconciled? Thus, the main goals of this research project were (1) to analyze the similarities and differences in the way Islam-rooted and secular organizations engaged human rights norms and articulated their claims, and (2) to investigate the social implications of the Islam-secular divide by examining inter-organizational relations within the movement. I explore areas of convergence and divergence especially among Islam-rooted and secular organizations by analyzing different organizations’ approaches to four specific issues: the death penalty, torture, Kurdish rights, and the headscarf ban. In addition, I analyze the factors that shaped each organization’s particular articulation of rights claims, as well as the factors that enabled and constrained coalition-building among disparate organizations. The study concludes that ideas concerning universal human rights—ideas rooted in international human rights norms and Islamic norms of justice—provided the language for local groups to articulate their grievances and the tools to devise solutions for Turkey’s human rights problem. More importantly, once grievances were expressed in terms of universal rights, these similar articulations formed the ideational building blocks that were used by organization leaders to transcend past models of advocacy work based on in-group solidarity. Additionally, discourses on civil society and democratization, as well as the shared experience of being political outsiders and victims of state abuse were also used by organization leaders to facilitate positive relations between disparate Islam-rooted and non-religious organizations. Over time, a movement collective identity emerged and crystallized around the idea of non-partisan human rights activism, which sustained movement cohesion even during periods of intense polarization between Islamists and secularists in Turkish society.",849716289,,Dissertations & Theses," Negron-Gonzales, MelindaNegron-GonzalesMelindaNegron-Gonzales, Melinda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2260543111 , 48189911 , 66569 , 9781124457895 , 3440907 , 3440907", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781124457895, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/849716289?accountid=14496," 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," European Studies , Middle Eastern Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Activism , Human rights , Islam , Kurds , Social movements , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=East+meets+West%3A+The+politics+of+human+rights+activism+in+Turkey%2C+1980%E2%80%932007&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Negron-Gonzales%2C+Melinda&amp;isbn=9781124457895&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"312,Trouble in our Fields: Health and Human Rights among Mexican and Caribbean Migrant Farm Workers in Canada,"For many years Canada has quietly rationalized importing temporary “low-skilled” migrant labour through managed migration programs to appease industries desiring cheap and flexible labour while avoiding extending citizenship rights to the workers. In an era of international human rights and global competitive markets, the Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) is often hailed as a “model” and “win-win” solution to migration and labour dilemmas, providing employers with a healthy, just-intime labour force and workers with various protections such as local labour standards, health care, and compensation. Tracing migrant workers’ lives between Jamaica, Mexico and Canada (with a focus on Ontario’s Niagara Region), this thesis assesses how their structural vulnerability as non-citizens effectively excludes them from many of the rights and norms otherwise expected in Canada. It analyzes how these exclusions are rationalized as permanent “exceptions” to the normal legal, social and political order, and how these infringements affect workers’ lives, rights, and health. Employing critical medical anthropology, workers’ health concerns are used as a lens through which to understand and explore the deeper “pathologies of power” and moral contradictions which underlie this system. Particular areas of focus include workers’ occupational, sexual and reproductive, and mental and emotional health, as well as an assessment of their access to health care and compensation in Canada, Mexico and Jamaica. Working amidst perilous and demanding conditions, in communities where they remain socially and politically excluded, migrant workers in practice remain largely unprotected and their entitlements hard to secure, an enduring indictment of their exclusion from Canada’s “imagined community.” Yet the dynamics of this equation may be changing in light of the recent rise in social and political movements, in which citizenship and related rights have become subject to contestation and redefinition. In analyzing the various dynamics which underlie transnational migration, limit or extend migrants’ rights, and influence the health of migrants across borders, this thesis explores crucial relationships between these themes. Further work is needed to measure these ongoing changes, and to address the myriad health concerns of migrants as they live and work across national borders.",858860242,,Dissertations & Theses," McLaughlin, JanetMcLaughlinJanetMcLaughlin, Janet",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2304027121 , 59652301 , 66569 , 9780494713648 , NR71364 , NR71364", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494713648, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858860242?accountid=14496," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Forensic anthropology , Public health , Labor relations , Ethnic studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Caribbean , Farmworkers , Human rights , Mexican , Migrant workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trouble+in+our+Fields%3A+Health+and+Human+Rights+among+Mexican+and+Caribbean+Migrant+Farm+Workers+in+Canada&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McLaughlin%2C+Janet&amp;isbn=9780494713648&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"313,Gender equality in education: india's responses to international agendas,"Despite the high profile of gender equality, little research has been conducted on the interaction between current international and national strategies in relation to female education.Â  The case of female education is particularly interesting, as there is little consensus on the meaning of â��gender equalityâ�� in education and why it is important.Â  The thesis explores these different conceptualisations and offers an historical perspective on the development of this global agenda since the mid-twentieth century whilst addressing such questions as: how are such global agendas interpreted at national level and what factors are influential in these processes?

The thesis' proposition is that these struggles have undergone qualitative changes. Their previously defensive strategies are developing into propositional strategies that increasingly focus on public and community alternatives to privatisation. This politicisation and movementisation of urban WATSAN is hardly discussed by academic literature, despite it being an emerging opportunity for propublic sector reform. Thus, the inquiry concerns the role of social movements in the exploration of alternatives to privatisation and looks at transnational networks and localnational struggles. This thesis employs critical ethnographic, participant research methodology. Empirical research took place from 2004 to 2008 and developed an emergent practice of politicised social movement research. As conceptual framework, the role of social movement in urban water and sanitation is considered as a process of radical reformism and social appropriation. On this basis, the global water justice movement's emergent discursive frame is analysed and found to centre on the democratisation of public water. By means of a comparative typology theory I then analyse local and national-level social struggles and develop the concept of pro-public challenge. Two case studies further elaborate on this type of political process of sector reform. These are the Uruguayan sector reform after a national referendum in 2004; and the case of Peru, where the embedded case of the city of Huancayo developed a public-public partnership as alternative to a planned water utility privatisation. The thesis develops a meso-level qualitative analysis of the political process of movementisation of sector reform in form of matrices, contingent pathways and contingent generalisations. The central finding is that social movements at transnational and local level develop new roles in pro-public sector reform. Despite substantive impacts, their power to implement alternative paths of development was found to be limited. They run the risk of not meeting all the resulting new challenges posed by politicised participation in sector reform, failing to develop adequate strategies, resources, organisational capacity and expert knowledge.",899749822,,Dissertations & Theses," Terhorst, PhilippTerhorstPhilippTerhorst, Philipp",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491271591 , 64937371 , 101309 , U514075 , U514075 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/9220", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899749822?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/9220 , 510325 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+social+movements+in+developing+public+alternatives+in+urban+water+services&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Terhorst%2C+Philipp&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"315,Class struggles and worker co-operatives in English Canada: 1844–1914,"This thesis traces the root causes of the failure of the worker co-operative movement in English Canada to socialise production by examining class relations at the turn of the twentieth century. It attempts to establish why it is that this type of production faded to become a successful, wide-spread and viable alternative to capitalist relations of production. It is an exercise in historical materialism and thus seeks to unearth the mechanisms at work that not only formed this type of co-operation in the first instance, but also stunted its implementation, growth and therefore any of its revolutionary potential. As such, this thesis attempts to reinstate long-silenced voices into the discourse surrounding the worker cooperative movement itself through re-visiting the rise and the fall of the Knights of Labour in North America. The past is dredged up in order to learn the lessons of these early co-operators so that the same mistakes are not repeated. This is critical because contemporary national and international industrial relations of production are on the cusp of important change as witnessed by the recent collaborative agreement between the United Steelworkers of America (USW) and the MONDRAGON industrial co-operative organisation of Spain 1 . The lessons of the past documented in this thesis are, therefore, important for two reasons. First of all, they teach us what does not work. Secondly, by teaching what does not work, they point the way to what will. Co-operatives tend to thrive when there is structural upheaval, economic crises, and when capitalism spreads. This is what happened in the past and it is what is happening now. Globally, co-operatives 'now employ more workers than all multi-national corporations combined (CCA, 2009) and the annual aggregate turnover of the top 300 mutuals and co-operative organisations is equal Canada's national output. The resources and the sheer numbers for a potential revolution of the social relations of production do exist. And yet the workers remain unorganised and worker co-operatives remain the smallest contributors to this global output. The historical reasons for this contemporary situation are explored throughout this thesis by i) examining the initial rise of co-operation in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, ii) tracing how the British and European movements influenced the pioneers of the Canadian co-operative movement, and iii) exploring what the lessons of the past mean for the future in the final chapter. The conclusion reached in this thesis is that if the past teaches us anything, it is that only by politicising and centralising alternatives to capitalist relations of production can the movement's potential for reformation be realised. Worker co-operatives need to be politicised. Local, grassroots movements need to be connected to a universal project of emancipation that can act as the glue that holds the movement together. Because local spaces ""...are subject to the power of capital over the co-ordination of universal fragmented space and the march of capitalism's global historical time lies outside the purview of any particular one of them"" (Harvey, 1990: 239), collective, co-operative action by local communities is the only strategy that will work. A co-ordinated, international effort must be grow out of this that is capable of supporting this undertaking in order to try to match the powers of global capitalism. 1 See Appendix D for full text.",1046429125,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, Dawn AnnetteJohnsonAnnetteDawnJohnson, Dawn Annette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2767584981 , 64044791 , 66569 , 9780494885123 , MR88512 , MR88512", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494885123, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1046429125?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0334 Canadian history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0334 Canadian history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0334 Canadian history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," Canadian history , Labor relations , Social structure", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Class+struggles+and+worker+co-operatives+in+English+Canada%3A+1844%E2%80%931914&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Dawn+Annette&amp;isbn=9780494885123&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"316,The Cinematic Network Society: Ethical Confrontations with New Proximities to Human Suffering in the Information Age,"This dissertation examines the global “network society” as a social formation with ethical implications for Western subjectivity by scrutinizing how twenty first century “global network” cinema maps the network’s democratizing and exploitative possibilities. Popular discourses have long provided a terrain in which new social and geographical proximities to the other, and new ethical responsibilities, can be negotiated as changing material conditions transform everyday life. Theoretically, this study draws upon Lacan’s notion of the symbolic order, Jameson’s notion of the imaginary social totality, and Foucault’s arguably incompatible concept of the dispositif or “apparatus” of discourses that render the social order intelligible and modes of conduct acceptable. Cinematic depictions of the network society represent efforts to signify (symbolizations); they present viewers with the rough parameters of intangible relations (cognitive maps); and their stars’ off-screen humanitarian pursuits and on-screen responses to human suffering envision idealized ethical modes of conduct (self-government). More than promoting celebrity adoration or ideological allegiance, these films depict their central agents experiencing mastery (plenitude) as well as impotence (lack) in the midst of the complex networks they inhabit. Methodologically, this thesis draws upon semiological and discursive analyses of twelve post-2000 global network films; celebrity humanitarian discourses; promotional-critical discourses accompanying the reception of each film; and fieldwork at film festivals and panels in North America and the UK. The emerging “cinematic network society” these films signify in fact comprises off-screen linkages between the filmmakers, advocacy groups, and the invisible sites of trauma these interests aim to publicize. But even this liberal Hollywood movement envisions the practice of global citizenship in somewhat conservative terms: as a series of ethical private responses to suffering that are continuous with the neoliberal project. This contradiction is central to wider political negotiations of new ethical relations with the other in an age when everyone is connected.",1516258088,,Dissertations & Theses," Narine, NeilNarineNeilNarine, Neil",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3275716741 , 86883612 , 66569 , 9780499231260 , NS23126 , NS23126", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780499231260, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1516258088?accountid=14496, 0900 Film studies, 0900 Film studies, 0900 Film studies,, 0900 Film studies, Film studies," Communication and the arts , Cognitive mapping , Ethical confrontations , Historical trauma , Hollywood films , Information age , Network society , Proximities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Cinematic+Network+Society%3A+Ethical+Confrontations+with+New+Proximities+to+Human+Suffering+in+the+Information+Age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Narine%2C+Neil&amp;isbn=9780499231260&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"317,The politics of international law: implications for the chechen conflict,"This thesis is a socio-legal study of the politics of international law (i.e. the relationship between international law and international politics). There is not necessarily an accepted scope, or even direction, of this relationship but it is widely perceived to be important in international, as well as national, affairs. Still, this relationship needs to be better understood and articulated. This thesis offers a theoretical and empirical account of the phenomenon of the politics of international law, and its implications for the Chechen conflict by exploring how and to what extent one's understanding of the phenomenon is determined by culture, history, political and social context. Part One is an overview of the literature and theoretical approaches to studying the relationship between (international) law and (international) politics, as well as an analysis of sixteen face-to-face semi-structured interviews with practitioners of international law and international politics from different backgrounds and cultures. That leads to a theoretical model which is applied and verified in Part Two, a case study of the Chechen conflict. This focuses specifically on a socio-historical understanding of international law, the humanitarian and human rights movement in Russia, and the relationship between human rights law and international humanitarian law in the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights in the so-called Chechen cases. The findings of this study indicate that international politics is highly influenced by international law just as international law is affected by international politics. They both are integral parts of the international system, nevertheless, remain distinct from each other. It is therefore the politics of international law that allows international relations to take place, where politics provides the means by which the negotiations can take place and law creates specific language and provides a framework within which the debates can take place. It demonstrates that the challenges of modern times make that the two become increasingly influential on one another.",1774213640,,Dissertations & Theses," Szablewska, Natalia M.SzablewskaM.NataliaSzablewska, Natalia M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989209311 , 103025032 , 101309 , 10020275 , 10020275 , http://hdl.handle.net/2160/7166", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774213640?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/2160/7166 , (UMI)AAI10020275 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+international+law%3A+implications+for+the+chechen+conflict&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Szablewska%2C+Natalia+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"318,Exploring the link between law and the fair trade movement: how can law be opened to reflect values from a social movement to benefit the world's poor?,"The fair trade movement has been established to create a mutual equality among people in a global pane to offset a gap of inequality and poverty exacerbated by the effect of globalization. One of the main principles of fair trade is based on the value of fairness and social solidarity to create a tie between business corporations and impoverished producers. While the livelihoods of small-scale producers depend on trading interactions with the business world, the main concern is that the nature of corporations in their profit-seeking behavior might result in abuses of resources, labor malpractices, and environment degradation in developing countries. In order to offset the danger that global business poses on the poor, the relationship between law and the fair trade movement has raised my interest in conducting this thesis so as to consider the extent that legal approaches can be argued to embrace legitimacy from emerging social norms. Legal imperatives from CSR and soft regulation will be explored to propose the weight of fair trade in shaping corporate practices to take ethical and moral commitment towards sustainability of human development. The uniqueness of the fair trade movement is to be explored in the light of legal theories concerning community and solidarity. Philosophical ideas of scholars like Selznick and Cotterrell argue for ‘bottom-up’ legitimacy grounded in community power that seeks for a responsive role of bureaucracy towards new demands in an ever-changing society. Their legal arguments have been greatly influential in a modern legal analysis on emerging concepts of regulation. The thesis is set out to propose that the fair trade movement possesses a distinctive set of social forces capable of influencing regulatory strategies and policies to render fairness and justice to the poor.",1779537230,,Dissertations & Theses," Khumon, PrapanpongKhumonPrapanpongKhumon, Prapanpong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015128321 , 103785192 , 101309 , U565028 , U565028 , http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/1290", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779537230?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/1290 , 535784 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+link+between+law+and+the+fair+trade+movement%3A+how+can+law+be+opened+to+reflect+values+from+a+social+movement+to+benefit+the+world%27s+poor%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khumon%2C+Prapanpong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"319,Study on bhaskar's critical realism,"Translation from original language as provided by author From the latter half of the 19th century, social science guadually coming into being. In the realm of the social science, the research of social science goes under two different tension. On the one hand, the positive philosophy of social science have occupied the mainstream status, and the positivisim come into being important ideas. The leading figures of positivisim are Comte, Spoucer and Durkheim. They thought there aren't essential different between nature phenomenon and social phenomenon. Nature and Society comform to the same methodology. They can be explained in the same laws of causation. They persist in science and exact in research, and they reject to some research which violate the principles of science. On the other hand, many non-positive ideas have appeared with the turn of philosophy of science and some antagonistic to positivism. They damaged the positivism greatly and appeard their characteristics. Max Weber, on the behalf of non-positive of social science, thought social phenomenon have some of special properties, and social phenomenon don't use methodology of natural science, they shoud establish their appropriate research method. The aim of social science is explaination, isn't prediction. In social science some subjective factors are taken into account. In fact, the situations of opposition and controversy appears that positivism and non-positivism are of different ideas. Each side persisted in its own view. Those two ideas are quite distinct from each other. However, on the one hand, we must recognize it isn't right that the ways of natural science is used to deal with social science uncritically. On the other hand, non-positive philosophy pay more attention to idealism, humanism, and try to deal with problems about social science. But they are dissatisfied with fruits. The research about philosophy of social science was thrown into a dilemma. It is a good idea that the two philosophical camps should dialogue, communication and cooperation. This way not only can maintain a necessary tension between the two philosophical camps, but also can transcencd old ideas and towards a special way. In the 1970s, as the social science version of scientific realism, critical realism, which advocated by British scientific philosopher Roy Bhaskar, is indeed a philosophy commit to criticize and transcend the two camp's philosophier and try to eatablish a sort of rational, middle, a third way. We will illuminate critical realism from ontology, epistemology, practice three degree. Then we will explore the foundation of ontology: stratified ontology, rootedness and emergence. We point out the general principle of critical realism: mechanism work in all kinds of things, mechanism is structure,force and tendency. This principle is used to research social science by Roy Bhaskar. The he explained Transformational Model of Social/person connection, Explanatory Critique, and reach to the code of critical realism--emanicipation and free. This is the final aim of social science too. Critical realism as an international, interdisciplinary movement, which affect lots of social discipline, such as Marxism, economics, space research of society, information system and so on. As the social science version of scientific realism, critical realism, which advocated by philosophyer Roy Bhaskar, is a new transcendental philosophy paradigm. Bhaskar realized that critical realism isn't permanent standpoint. It embodys an effect of underlabouerner and midwife, put up a bridge of communication for philosophy in the future. We research the idea of critical realism, and analyse critical realism's value and significance for philosophy of social science.

With the development of information society, people which use free software are becoming more and more. Free software movement is thus the rise. In the process of free software movement development, also differentiated the open source movement. It not only adhered to the fundamental spirit of the free software movement, but also combined with commercial development. At present the free software movement has been from the start-up phase to a high speed in the development stage. With the free software movement, it has also been accompanied by controversy. In this paper, we think that the free software movement's ethical spirit is openness, freedom and sharing together. In the ethical spirit, freedom is the core. This spirit of ethics make by two ways. First, scientific ethics, free software movement is the new renaissance of scientific ethics in the IT sector. Second, the spirit of the Internet and the spirit of the open source movement build a network information of core IT culture together. At the same time, free software movement is not extreme freedom, but rather to establish the contract in their own, the self-consistent freedom. After this try, ethical spirit of free software has been analysed with the traditional ethical theories. Deontology and Consequentialism are the most important theory of the traditional theory. They are both comparative and complementary, alternately play the role of guiding human behavior. Kantianism and Social Contract are the most important things among to Deontology, The main representative of Consequentialism is Utilitarian. Through the study of these ethical theories, we found that any of these theories are not perfect. Each theory has not enough, we integrated with these types of ethical theory, to explore the ethical values of the free software, and inquiry their Ethical Implications of the reasonableness. Afterwards, the thesis tries to conduct rational analysis to the ethics of free software, advocating integration or beyond of traditional ethical theory. In other words, the two theories should be combined to maintain the necessary tension with the help of practice being, in order to realize the dialectical unity. On this basis, the thesis attempts to combine academy and problems to explore the opportunity of developing country's software growth which is brought about by the free software movement. Mainly from the practical point of view, the free software will be placed under the broad social context and historical space. It probes into the closely related ""digital gap"" and ""cultural imperialism"" and some more issue. It also makes a study of challenges and significances on the information society, especially it elaborates the importance of catching up from behind to our information industry. The thesis reckons that: the fact choosing the vibrant free software which meets the growing trend of the historical times as the developing direction of Chinese software industry is irreversible option under the condition of the real economy of Chinese society and the circumstance of international industries. At last, the thesis provides us with the basic strategy for the development of Chinese software industries exploring free",1868352051,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Xiao FeiLiuFeiXiaoLiu, Xiao Fei",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313749111 , 111083942 , 189128 , 10373797 , 10373797", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868352051?accountid=14496, 0402 Philosophy of Science, 0402 Philosophy of Science, 0402 Philosophy of Science,, 0402 Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Science," (UMI)AAI10373797 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+of+the+ethical+spirit+of+free+software+under+the+background+of+free+software+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Xiao+Fei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"321,On the improvement of chinese legal systems of corporate environmental,"Translation from original language as provided by author The scale of modern enterprise expands unceasingly. They monopolize the industry that they belong to, and cause profound influences to national politics, economics and social life. In this context, Shelton, a America scholar, first raised the notion of social liability of enterprise .He thinks that the enterprise can't put the profits as their only target, the moral factors should be involved during the existence of enterprise. The enterprise should carry social liability to other interest groups when it makes profits. With the increasing influence to modern life caused by enterprise, it is a common sense that enterprise should take social liability, although there is a controversy about the boundary . Enterprises are the creators of social wealth, but also a major consumer of resources and a major source of environmental pollution. As we revel in the rich production brought products, but be concerned about the environment consumed production costs and social costs. Production caused by shortage of resources, environmental pollution, ecological damage, which has seriously restricted the sustainable and healthy development of human society. With the increase of public awareness, the green consumer movement, positive commitment to corporate social responsibility to the environment, production of green technology, which is to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises is the only way to save the environment. China has made remarkable achievements in reform and opening up , but we must keep clear conscious that great environmental problems has been incurred by the rapid economic growth. China, as a developing country with billions of people, is facing great economic and environmental pressure in the fierce international market competition. Profit is the final purpose of enterprises,therefor, if the enterprises should bear higher environmental responsibility, the law should be applied other than only resorting to the enterprises social responsibility. The punitive mechanism and incentive mechanism should be combined and the enterprises should be guided to shift to green production.Therefor,studying how to create a sound enterprises' environmental social responsibility is of great practical significance in enhancing the market competitiveness of Chinese enterprises and improving the ecological environment in China. The paper applied the methods of comparative analysis and empirical analysis and it was divided into five chapters to discuss the legal mechanism of enterprises'social responsibility.In chapter one,the preface introduced the research background, research meaning and the basic framework.Chapter two outlines corporate environmental social responsibility, defines the concept of corporate environmental social responsibility and demonstrates its scientific content, and analyzes the necessity and legitimacy of corporate environmental social responsibility. Chapter three compares the corporate social responsibility between the developed countries and our country. The paper tries to analyze the difference of awareness concept and performance status in corporate social responsibility in our country and in developed countries. It also introduced the successful experience in environmental legislation of developed countries. Chapter four is about corporate social responsibility in our country. First of all, it illustrates the shortcomings of the current environmental legislation in China. Then, considering the country's condition, the paper tries to create a new legal mechanism of corporate social environmental responsibility that meets the need of China economic development, including renewing the legislative ideas,adjusting the legislation principle and strengthening the corporates' environmental legal liability.Chapter five is about conclusion and the shortcomings of the paper. The legal system construction about enterprise environmental liability not only needs to learn from foreign advanced experience, but also needs to consider the China's actual conditions. It needs to pay attention to requirements of environmental protection, and also needs to prevent the legislation from neglecting enterprise profits target. The legal construction is just one of social adjust instruments, and it only stipulates the minimum moral requirements. So, it is not enough to use legal construction as the only measure to regulate enterprise environmental actions, and also can't meet the environmental protection demands. It is a complicate, long-term plan to make enterprise take environmental protection liability. So the realization of this plan needs enterprise to take their responsibility positively, sound legal system, responsible governments, and public",1868630702,,Dissertations & Theses," He, Wei JunHeJunWeiHe, Wei Jun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314327911 , 111106192 , 189128 , 10367718 , 10367718", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868630702?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10367718 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+improvement+of+chinese+legal+systems+of+corporate+environmental&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=He%2C+Wei+Jun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"322,The survival on lifeboat-the research on garrett hardin's political outlook of north-south,"Translation from original language as provided by author Lifeboat theory was an influential political theory in the 70 era of the last century, but for many people in the country, it is still unknown. The In-depth studying on lifeboat theory can help us to have a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary Western concept of global politics on North -Nouth ,which have considerable influence in the political area ,and more importantly, we present economic and social development problems and difficulties encountered by now have significant degree of similarity with the last century 70 era of capitalist society,therefore, by in-depth reading of the lifeboat theory, we can learn from Harding to get some useful ideas of the mental element. By the use of text study in English, from the systematic and comprehensive principle, from the historical background and philosophical perspective, I explain and analyze the root causes of lifeboat theory.The core part of the lifeboat theory is lifeboat model and Harding's North-South political outlook. Lifeboat model is a metaphor, with it Harding explains vividly the relationship between the North and the South,which is just as the lifeboat floating in the sea. lifeboats model based on , Harding outlined his political vision of North and South, mainly involving four aspects -international aid, the establishment of the World Food Bank, the green revolution, international migration. After Hardin's lifeboat theory was published, domestic and foreign scholars, especially in developing countries, criticised him fiercely.In response, Harding has written numerous articles, with his bioethics debated tit for tat with the traditional ethics for his lifeboat theory of defense, argueing that his concept of the North-South political are reasonable. How to look at Hardin's lifeboat theory? I think we should apply the Marxist point of view, insist on two points, witch means that we must see the theoretical shortcomings such as lack of reality, but also see that it put forward valuable ideas and perspectives. through theoretical research on Harding' lifeboat we can drawn benefit of some enlightenment for China's socialist modernization. As the largest developing country,China should actively seek international assistance and participate in the world economic integration process, thus speeding up the development of China's social productive forces and forward movement, narrowing the gap between China and developed countries. In the process of foreign aid, our government must prevent rent-seeking behaviorand improve the utilization of foreign aid funds. China's development needs to be based on carrying capacity, which means firmly and unwaveringly taking the road of scientific development and taking family planning as the country's basic national policy to strictly control population growth, to promote sound and fast economic and social forward development Key words:lifeboat theory;the green revolution; ratchet effect;international",1868757931,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, Wen GuiZhouGuiWenZhou, Wen Gui",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314407671 , 111111732 , 189128 , 10332159 , 10332159", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868757931?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10332159 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+survival+on+lifeboat-the+research+on+garrett+hardin%27s+political+outlook+of+north-south&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Wen+Gui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"323,Discussion of bookchin's social ecology,"Translation from original language as provided by author In the fifties of the twentieth century,Murray Bookchin was an Americal veteran of the green theorists and social theorists, and actively participated in various ecological movement. Gradually,he combined the idea of anarchism and ecology and creatively reflected of radical tradition of Europe and the United States,then he set up his own theory called social ecology.He also named it ""eco-anarchism"". Bookchin's social ecology insisted that the domination of person-to-person caused the man's domination over the nature. The ecological crisis just rooted in the hierarchy of human society.The solution was to learn from the experiences of radical democracy and freedom derived from citizens assembly and municipal in western history,to wipe all forms of hierarchy,to realize the communism anarchism.The anarchy of nature provided a good running model of mankind, which was that all nature things were co-evolution and co-existence .The ecological reconstruction of society of Bookchin,which bypassed the capitalist system and avoided the class struggle,was really an ecological utopia of moralism. Bookchin's social ecology to solve the relationship between man and nature,gived us a new perspective and a new way of thinking.The thesis was divided into three chapters to introduce Bookchin's social ecology. The first chapter explained the formation, source and the main content of Bookchin's Social Ecology.Bookchin's social ecology theory was inseparable from social development,particularly when the people paid close attention to the human environment in the sixties of the twentieth century .The concept of social ecology was an inevitable product of social development. Bookchin absorpted,synthesised and developed the ideas of Christianity,Aristotle,Spinoza,Hegel,Marx and Kropotkin and others,some ideasand ecological,sociology,anarchism,liberalism. Bookchin's social ecology reviewed prehistoric ""organic society""era,before the emergence of the hierarchy and capitalism,and investigated the perception of non-hierarchical,habits,values and culture of egalitarian beliefs,and created the main features of the ancient which represented not simple principle of minimum protection ensuring everyone access to the material necessities of life means;Usufruct of the property and not believe in property ownership;Complementary and ethics different from a moral order and submit, connected a radical eco-political-related organic community .These principles must combine rational,science and modern technology and re-design in order to promote human and non-human world of integrated.This choice of integration would constitute a new social practice and the dominant perception. Chapter II commented Bookchin's social ecology of the philosophical basis,which solved global environmental problems.Through Bookchin's research methodology,it revealed an insurmountable contradiction Bookchin's theory.But we could also get useful wisdom and enlightenment.Meanwhile Bookchin's social ecology could give us a kind of world view. The third chapter evaluated Bookchin's social ecology.Meanwhile, it sort out the relationship between social ecology and sustainable development.As a radical theory,which not only provided an additional theory of sustainable development, but also changed the existing social system and our longer-term vision to provide a rich source of inspired imagination.Bookchin's social ecology also was still an evolving theory,some of which was less than worthy of us to think and make up.Concerned how to overthrow the capitalist system, Bookchin did not give specific operational practices,and he did not give the historical task of the working class, but counting on some organization which had cultural ties,which added utopian color to his ideal of ecological community KEY WORDS:social ecology;hierarchy;dialectical",1868758210,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, Li KaiZhouKaiLiZhou, Li Kai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314407841 , 111115242 , 189128 , 10343739 , 10343739", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868758210?accountid=14496, 0402 Philosophy of Science, 0402 Philosophy of Science, 0402 Philosophy of Science,, 0402 Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Science," (UMI)AAI10343739 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Discussion+of+bookchin%27s+social+ecology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Li+Kai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"324,Strategy research of anhui economy coping financial crisis under the international view,"Translation from original language as provided by author After American loan crisis evolving the international finance crisis, it has had the huge impact on the whole world financial system and the entity economy.

Anhui Province is a developing province in middle area, comparing with some coastal area's developed provinces, its influence is smaller than others , but has also encountered the major difficulty and the pressure. How as soon as meets to succeed from the financial crisis which as soon as hundred years meet, turns the danger into opportunity, is a most urgent also the thorniest question in front of various countries, it relates economical development and the political stability. The US-led developed country launches in abundance helps oneself to move, innovates unceasingly, the positive exploration, the luminescent spot is unceasing, the scotoma also many. Although China is not crisis's source area, but is actually crisis's victim. Anhui's as national chess in ""the board game piece"", facing financial crisis's impact, Anhui economy cannot escape by luck. Under this situation, in view of the fact that the financial crisis conducts time difference on the way, the US-led developed country rescues in advance, its crisis saves the strategy to be worth China using for reference including Anhui, by little detours, are many result. Anhui is a middle big province, although the economical extroversion is not high, but because economic development's some intrinsic characteristics caused the financial system and the entity economy varying degree have been under the international finance crisis's impact.

This paper analyzed the current situantion of DQE INTERNATIONAL's agency of steel material purchase and sale business roundly and detailedly and the company's problems in agency existed in according to the strategic management, strategic shift and core competitiveness theory. The thesis analyzed the macro-environment of the DQE INTERNATIONAL's agency of steel material purchase and sale business using PEST models and from the angle of industry structure and market demand. And then, from basic situation of the DQE INTERNATIONAL, company operation ability to existing customers and suppliers are analyzed from the micro-environment angle. On the macro-environment, the political context, the domestic economy environment and the social environment are conducive to the development of company business, and the international and the technical environment caused the corporate business suppressed. no matter in the DAQING OILFIELD or outside there exsited realistic and the latent competitor as well as the substitute threat. DQE INTERNATIONAL had lower bargaining power to its service's customer but to its supplier it had higher bargaining power, and the company business had a tendancy of decreasing along with the international environment as well as the technical environment. On the micro-environment, the DQE INTERNATIONAL's business, customer and suppliers' number and type assumed substantially slide to the situation what was very disadvantageous to the company whole movement. So finding the main problem in the company operating is strategic orientation being improper, the construction of supply being weakly and market tending to shrink largely which need to change present situation promptly by adopting the effective strategic measure what was not favor company's development. Finally, this paper analyzed the based on the industry status by using SWOT model, and analyzed the DQE INTERNATIONAL's agency of steel material purchase and sale business strategic orientation and the strategic target based on the consistent strategic target, competitive advantage and humanist basic principle instruction. And then proposed company strategic mode and the processing of connection with the two from customers and suppliers angles and puts forward the strategic shift route of the company's agency of steel material purchase and sale business divided two steps. And the proposed attaching importance to talent development and training, expanding the breadth of the business, developing and selecting the qualified supplier, speeding up to use the management information system as well as organization flexibility strategy methods and so on. After that, this thesis raised the supporting measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the strategic shift from the enterprise culture innovation, the company internal and external organization and operation mechanism innovation and the management information system's establishment in agency of steel material purchase and sale business",1868829439,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, BoZhangBoZhang, Bo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314593961 , 111111992 , 189128 , 10359383 , 10359383", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868829439?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAI10359383 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+strategic+transformation+of+dqe+international%27s+agency+of+steel+material+purchase+and+sale+business&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Bo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"327,A study of eu's international immigration problems and policies,"Translation from original language as provided by author The world is a globalized world. Trend of internationalization and opening increased communication among countries, population movements have Become more frequent. Under the background of globalization, the European Union has the typical nature both in the overall number of international immigrations and in the proportion of international immigrations. The EU has become the main immigrations area in the world. The quantity of international immigrations sharp growth has had a series of influences to European Union's development. On the one hand, a large number of international immigrations to enter, make up the situation of the EU's population aging period, the population of the low birth rate and labor shortage, to meet the EU's economic and social development needs and promote the sustained and stable development of the EU. On the other hand, because the huge differences between international immigrations and the EU's residents in political civilization, economic development levels, cultures and values, it has caused the serious social issues, economic issues, cultural issues and political issues. The negative impacts of international immigrations induced gradually emerged, international immigrations problem has become the core issues of the EU that to be solved. The EU has realized the seriousness of the issue of international immigrations, take a series of policies and measures to deal with this challenge positively. With the expansion of the European Union, EU's member states gradually recognized the need of the EU to develop a positive common international immigrations policies to deal with the international immigrations issues.According to the theory of Thomas Hamar, the EU's international immigrations policies can be divided into two parts, namely international immigrations control policy and international immigration fusion policy. EU experienced international immigrations control policies and then to further their own way to coordinate the integration process. But European Union's international immigrations fusion policy was still at the exploration stage at present, has not formed the fixed pattern, but also needs to further strengthen in reality and to consummate.Meanwhile, the EU also strengthened international cooperation with immigrant-sending countries, trying to control the source of international immigrations flows and deal with the international immigrations problem. Generally speaking, the EU's international immigrations policy has made great progress. However, due to international immigrations is a very complex issue, with national political, economic, cultural, and other closely related, it is a very sensitive issue. There are many situations limited the international immigrations policies integration. Despite there are various negative factors, the EU remains make great contribution to the goals of common international immigrations policy. facing so many problem that brought by the international immigrations,the EU will play an more and more important role in this area.the common international immigrations policy will also be just round the",1869054134,,Dissertations & Theses," Shi, Xiao PengShiPengXiaoShi, Xiao Peng",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314897521 , 111108272 , 189128 , 10334927 , 10334927", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869054134?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10334927 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+eu%27s+international+immigration+problems+and+policies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shi%2C+Xiao+Peng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"328,A study on relationship between pharmaceutical corporate social responsibility and financial performance,"Translation from original language as provided by author During 21st century, corporate social responsibility has become a common management practice and also has been paid great attention by global businesses and governments. With rapid development of China's economic, many domestic industries have been stimulated and have developed at an unprecedented speed. With global economic integration and growth, more domestic enterprises are encouraged to participate in international market competition. Facing with domestic and international market competition, consumers' demands for high quality products, environmental deterioration and insufficient natural resources, industry competition and enterprise credit crisis, employees' protection for their legal rights and the requirements of corporate social responsibility for social stability and harmony, domestic corporations must seek new strategies to improve their competitive qualities. The movements of corporate social responsibility are flourishing in the global world, which are considered as guides for corporation social responsibility development and can provide a favorable external environment, more importantly, if we can clarify the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, it will enhance the corporate social responsibility action.

As a left-wing whose theories reflected the current globalization, American historian Alif Dirlik's Critique of Global Capitalism stressed the need to understand the history of globalization, and to understand globalization as a new stage of capitalism, that which was called ""global capitalism"" phase. From Alif Dirlik's ""new international division of labor"" perspective, the current capitalist stages were summarized to the seven characteristics, and Globalization was thought to be the capitalism's ""Global abstract"". Dirlik emphasized,in the era of global capitalism, as new technologies to the capital and production, production appeared to be oriented in a perpetual state of constant movement, which was to seek the best interests of capital against labor, while also out of capital activities, social and political interference, there had been ""flexible production"". Because of this ""flexible"", capitalism got an unprecedented flexibility and adaptability. Capital hegemony, which became more frequent, more subtle and more ambiguous, expanded in the region and areas, and was formatted to be a three-dimensional network-like hegemony with a broader, more depth and more powerful structure. Dirlik brought the critical to new forms of global capitalist hegemony, and put it as a ""liberation politics"" of the specific historical context. He stressed that liberate politics was the overall replacement of capitalism. Around this problem, Dirlik outlined the liberation of a global capitalist agenda with ""borderline"" of the ""post-revolutionary,"" ""post-socialism"" and other terms. It was the product of complex context that Dirlik summarized the current situation of ""after the revolution"". His ""post-revolutionary"" had dual-related characteristics. On the one hand it refered to recognize post-colonial ""anti-revolutionary"" position, on the other hand it implied that the revolution itself into a new condition and must therefore be a new form of display, which is its ""re-invention of the revolution"", mean that the reconstruction of global social relations under capitalism. Dirlik made two post-revolutionary strategies for the reconstruction of social relations: the overall cultural revolution and specific ""local"" revolution. This specific ""local"" revolution will be the concrete forms of struggle to solve its problems of inequality and oppression, and resistance a place to global capitalism. The agenda of global capitalism and the liberation of the era of socialism envisaged by Dirlik Suffered in contemporary China experienced the actual situation. On a long history of research in China, Dirlik captured the history of the Chinese revolution, a flexible view of politic, socialism in China has its own unique understanding. This unique understanding allows Dirlik out of the ideological background of Western scholars of ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"" has made a very unique ""post-socialist"" understanding, and made it as ""the socialist era of global capitalism"" theoretical inspiration and practical paradigm. Dirlik's ""flexible production"", ""post-revolutionary"" theory, as well as ""post-socialism"", were not the real Marxism. But Dirlik's new socialist ideas critical and global hegemony of capitalism made us deep perspective the global picture of the world capitalist era. We saw a variety of subjects living condition under the hegemony of transnational capital, and felt the vitality of the contemporary world of Marxist critique of capitalist hegemony.

Given the basic development trend of the international situation, The private international law department which the core issues to resolve conflict of laws will face both opportunities and challenges. However, opportunities will outweigh challenges. Therefore, the study of how private international law development, knowing the movements of its future has become an important theoretical issue.

These theories are closely related to the historical background of the glissade of leadership of international system and the position of America in the world. During the 60s-70s, owing to the struggle for the hegemony of the world with Soviet Union, the United States fell into the Vietnam War and faced the challenge of developing countries. Due to the chain reactions which were brought by the oil crisis, American economy was confronted with difficulties and Bretton Woods System collapsed in the 1970s. This international and domestic situation made the scholars rethink profoundly the foreign strategy of America, and start the discussion of the course of the world politics. Based on this background, Modelski, who explores the history of international relationship in half a millennium and relies on the model of international politics theory, and draws on the experience of Kondratieff wave, Arnold Toynbee's cycle theory, Immanuel Wallerstein's modern world-system, Parsons's phase-movement theory, proposes the theory of disciplinarian of a political campaign which is the cycle theory of leadership. The core-concept of this theory is cycle and the leadership of world politics. In the system of world politics, the great power constitutes the international rules and provides international defense and security, and so on. Otherwise, the other countries can enjoy the fruits of these by free. This system will crash and collapse after a period of time, and another new power will replace it. This new power will build a new world system. During this process, the critical factor is Global War. The appearance of new power, alternation of world leadership, the establishment of international order will present common cycle phenomena. A cycle will last ranging from 100 to 120 years, and every cycle can be divided to 4 phases: the phase of Global War, the phase of world power, the phase of delegitimation and the phase of deconcentration. Every phase lasts 30 years. After 1494, the leader countries are Portugal, Netherlands, Britain and United states. Modelski corrects the opinion which attaches too much importance to the behavioral science and neglects the role of modern international history in political science. He inosculates the approach of behaviorism and modern international history, and investigates the relationship between war and economic cycle. He integrates the Parsons's phase-movement theory into the theory of international relationship. Although the approach of Modelski's long cycle, which is based on the study of history and the emphasis on the forecast of future, is limited with the change of time and space. According to the limitation other scholars proposes the different opinions, such as Joshua Goldstein, who connects war with economic in order to search the phenomenon of cycle, emphasizes the specialization of the social science. So he argues that it is necessary to cancel the disciplinarian of the cycle to maintain the long cycle in terms of long wave, Terry Boswell Mike Sweat points out that the long cycle can not resolve the relationship between cycle and war well, however, the resources theory explains the causal connections between economic expansion and the size of major wars in a better way; Charles F. Doran underlines the importance of power cycle of the nation-state, instead of the minority leader countries. However,it will be significant for China that Modelski's objective conclusion of history and his view about what qualities a leader country should possess. Although we do not attempt to develop into a leader state, the power of a state will play a crucial role under the state of anarchy. Therefore the long cycle theory is of practical significance for the direction of our development in the",1870381630,,Dissertations & Theses," He, FeiHeFeiHe, Fei",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316293341 , 111108272 , 189128 , 10436816 , 10436816", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870381630?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10436816 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cyclical+logic+to+the+transition+of+hegemony-reanalysis+of+george+modelski%27s+long+cycle+theory+in+world+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=He%2C+Fei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"332,The exploration of juan.linz's theory of democratic consolidation,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since the 1970s, the third wave of democratization led to the global democratization reform movement.

Juan Jose Linz is one of the most famous scholars researching the global democratization, his research includes the analysis of historical, social, economical, and political reasons of democratic breakdown, the relationship between democratic consolidation and constitutional institutions, the reasons of democratic regime rebuilding after autocracy and the discussion of the required qualifications of consolidating democratic regime existing racial, social and political cleavages. Linz defines the conception of democratic consolidation from the three dimensions- behavioral, attitude, and constitutional, and comprehensively explores the social, economical, cultural and political factors which promote the democracy; Linz further discuss the vital variables influencing the future of democratic consolidation- constitutional institutions, racial conflicts, social and economical development, international environment. And Linz points out the five important areas for democratic transition and democratic consolidation- civil society, political society, bureaucracy of state, law of rule, economical society; Linz redefines the modern non-democratic regimes based on the four dimensions of diversity, ideology, leading power, motivation, and accordingly points out the potential approaches and assignment of democratic consolidation from the transition of non-democratic regimes to democratic regimes. In addition, Linz discusses the relations between the various types of regime and democratic consolidation, and leads to a meaningful academic debate regarding with presidential system vs. parliamentary system.

They were the mainstream of Chinese population, who were educated, rich, open, trusted and cared the public affairs, had the right to speak, the political power and the ability to act.

It focused on Nancun, a common village in the Pearl River Delta in Guandong Province, to study its changes with the globalization. The auther observed and tried to understand these changes,and discussed both the active and passive practice in the local community in the isomorphic process of globalization and localization. In this paper, according to Geertz' framework of functionism used to analyze social change, the social structures and cultural structures in Nancun were studied. Nancun had been marching on the road of modernization since the opening and reforming, the boundaries of the village increasingly diversified under the influence of some political and economic factors, non-agricultural-based modes of production and way of life also changed villagers' own identites, the social stratification and the gap between the rich and the poor in it coincide with the trend of globalization trends. In the village economy, most traditional economic forms almost disappeared, and the old collective economy had been replaced by a new collective economy, and meanwhile new forms of organization and interest patterns appear in the village. These changes are not entirely a product of globalization and modernization. The network of state's administration and the network of rural culture was intertwine and interact in community life. The traditional village ethics are also involved in creating some new social rules in the countryside, every force had it's road to express, game and practise in dealing with resources and discourse. All of these had affected or determined the speed and direction of the changes in the village. The dissertation has combed Nancun's history and got different images of the different historical periods. As a village with a single clan , family culture and family memories in the community had been enormous roles in forming the collective personality. Meanwhile, the clan was also changing, ""lineage renaissance"" was in fact memories of peasants' miss about the tradition of collective, was their choice for survival and security or development in the impact of globalization. By discussing the presentation and the facts in nature, or something changing and unchanging in the Village's history and tradition, we can describe and perceive Nancun's yesterday, today and tomorrow. Combined with cultural capital flows Brought about by globalization and the village's own local resources, the ancient village tourism had developed. Tourism with one hand, is a product of global consumnism, and on the other hand is a strategy of promoting the sustainable movement for the country. The local society non-passively responded to the trend of globalization, the villages and farmers had their own behavior choices of the main considerations when facing social change from top to bottom. The source of their selection strategy were the local cultural structure and social factors behind their practices. We can find that the local society has enough vitality to protect their existence and continuation in the globalization and localization process just like what we have found in Nancun. The ability were able to adapt to several changes and had protect all communities and residents in any one historical periods including globalization. Because of this, the distance of social structure and cultural structure in rapid changes does not necessarily lead to social fracture, the local tradition of vitality and wisdom can make people able to create some changes in the global economy to pursue of wealth and also enable the social stability and the villagers' satisfactory strategy. The example of Nancun showed that on the one hand, the history of village and people's experience are embedded in and affected by the changes of the framework in national or international situation, on the other hand, thr changes in local societies are rooted in local cultural context and system, it can transform and adapt to cope with the impact from the outside world. The inherent vitality and creativity of local society are just the base and incentive for us to promote local cultural self-consciousness and build new, harmonious countries in the global",1870564067,,Dissertations & Theses," Zou, QiongZouQiongZou, Qiong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316328521 , 111111362 , 189128 , 10349816 , 10349816", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870564067?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAI10349816 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+practice+in+nancun--changes+of+villages+in+the+pearl+river+delta+in+the+process+of+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zou%2C+Qiong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"335,The tea party and its reason in american politics- perspective of social movement,"Translation from original language as provided by author Nowadays the researches about Tea Party have the common characteristics that the statement of facts is too much and the theoretical research is too little, the News perspective is too much and the political perspective is too little, influence study is too much and cause study is too little, and overseas study is too much and domestic study is too little. Especially it is widely believed in the researches that the cause of formation of Tea Party is the direct reaction of discontent to the U.S government. The author believes that the three characteristics of Tea Party: the topiclization of political goals, the Decentralization of organizational forms and the temporality of the member base shows that the Tea Party is an emerging social movement rather than the ""Third Party"" of the American politics. Therefore the author tries to set up a reason analysis model through the theoretical perspective of social movement to analyze the cause of the Tea Party Movement. The author believes under the surface reason of anti-Obama and against big government, there is profound social political and economic background behind the appearance and rapid development of the Tea Party phenomenon. The right-minded social thoughts and deep rooted finance - economic conservatism was the thinking basis. The personal value and civil liberty concerned Post-Materialism was the new affect to social movement. The outright collapse like weak economy and sky-high unemployment brought by global financial crisis and the deficit policies of U.S government caused Crisis Syndrome, more and more citizens lose their sense of security made the public foundation for the Tea Party Movement. The social fragmentation trend brought by the American unique political structure and the development of the Internet also provided political foundation and technical condition for the Tea Party Movement.This research through social movement perspective might help to provide a new thinking for the political studies of Tea Party",1874992579,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, TaoChenTaoChen, Tao",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319431461 , 70613782 , 189128 , 10539058 , 10539058", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874992579?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10539058 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+tea+party+and+its+reason+in+american+politics-+perspective+of+social+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Tao&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"336,To walk or fly?: The folk narration of community and identity in twentieth century black women's literature of the Americas,"My dissertation focuses on the function of black vernacular myths and rituals in three primary women’s texts of the Americas: Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon (1977), Simone Schwartz-Bart’s Pluie et Vent sur Telumee Miracle (1972) and Paule Marshall’s Praisesong for the Widow (1983). My project codifies how the black vernacular expressions of mythology and ritual are used to negotiate power between the individual and their community. Specifically, I trace how the women in these texts used resources of the black vernacular tradition as social and cultural collateral to empower themselves within an alternative system of values that simultaneously validates self and communal worth. Analyzing the transnational myths of the Flying Africans/Ibo Landing—myths of newly-arrived Africans escaping slavery by flight or by walking on water back to Africa, I contend that the performances of these myths and dance rituals not only created kinship bonds but also provided opportunities for expanding the parameters of community. This writing grew from the limits of the Black Arts Movement (1960-1970) when the male-dominated discourse on the black vernacular traditions focused on creating a voice distinct from, and often in conflict with, the prevailing white literary establishment. Simultaneously, Second Wave Feminism left women of color outside of the discourse on social justice and their definition of womanhood. I argue that these black women authors responded to this marginalization within their affinity groups by employing folk traditions to observe intra-communal dynamics. Doing so created a model of internal reflection that both revealed the seeds of internalized dominant/subordinate ideologies and served as an alternative method to record the impact of the larger social structure of domination. These authors located black women’s knowledge and power in liminal folk spaces in their novels. Taken together, they introduced a metaphor for black women’s positioning in the Black Arts Movement and Second Wave Feminism; folk traditions from this insider/outsider perspective became tools to navigate and critique systems of domination. These texts provided dramatizations of a black feminist perspective, navigating black women’s experiences of intersectionality, thus employing folk knowledge as a means to create new possibilities from historical traditions.",250874529,,Dissertations & Theses," Tolbert, Tolonda MicheleTolbertMicheleTolondaTolbert, Tolonda Michele",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2009101251 , 51557061 , 66569 , 9781109694529 , 3397521 , 3397521", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109694529, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250874529?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," Comparative literature , African American Studies , Black studies , Caribbean literature , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Barbados , Black ethnic literature , Black vernacular tradition , Black women , Caribbean literature , Cultural studies , Diversity studies , Folk narration , Folklore studies , Guadaloupe , Marshall, Paule , Morrison, Toni , Schwartz-Bart, Simone , Twentieth century , Women writers , Women's literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=To+walk+or+fly%3F%3A++The+folk+narration+of+community+and+identity+in+twentieth+century+black+women%27s+literature+of+the+Americas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tolbert%2C+Tolonda+Michele&amp;isbn=9781109694529&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"337,"Negotiating spectacle: Florence Mills, Josephine Baker &amp;amp; Adelaide Hall, transnational black women's expressive culture 1920-1935","Negotiating Spectacle highlights three African American women vaudeville entertainers as part of the trans-Atlantic and transnational genre of black expressive culture to demonstrate the ways in which the performance of ethnographic spectacles and the performers of such spectacles became racial and gender signifiers of nationhood and industrial modern movements. This cultural, historical project articulates the relationship between the acts of race and lived race to demonstrate the ways in which theatrical performances of the exotic non-white by African American women during the early twentieth century reiterated colonial ideas of race, sexuality and nation as well as conveyed an early twentieth century Afro-centric feminism. This dissertation comprises five chapters which examine the rise in popularity in Europe and the United States of black women vaudeville performers and their performance in theatrical race spectacles. Following the Introduction, in Chapter One I offer a feminist reading of black vaudeville women and demonstrate the expressive possibilities of performance. In Chapter Two, I theorize the relationship between Josephine Baker's trans-Atlantic success and African American modernity. This chapter also posits a connection between black diasporic aims toward equality and black women's trans-Atlantic and transnational cultural productions. In Chapter Three I demonstrate black uses of commodity culture and feminist articulations of the body. This chapter illuminates the uneasy relationship between black women's expressive culture and African American political and social pursuits toward equality and self determination. Finally, in the Conclusion I revisit the theme of black modernity and discuss the overall theoretical implications of the relationship between transnational race and gender theatrical spectacles and black modernity.

In response to this femicide, a social movement called Ni Una Más (Not One More) emerged, holding the creation of awareness as both a main goal and outcome. Though a significant process for participants within social movements, awareness is absent as a defined concept within social movement literature. For the purposes of this thesis, awareness will be defined as a cognizant realization of the problem resulting in collective indignation. Part of the process of creating collective indignation among those unaffected by the murders is the involvement both activist and non-activist actors doing both visible and invisible work to bring attention to them, and hopefully elicit an emotional response. However, even if the goal of collective indignation is met, knowledge of a problem does not guarantee one's ability, or even desire, to take action. Translation work must be done to transform awareness into a form of capital that addresses the problem. In the case of the femicide in Ciudad Juárez, actors in the arts/media, academic, and political realms have used their professional positions to translate awareness into awareness products. These awareness products do not work to solve the crimes or prevent future murders. However, these products do generate further knowledge that moves towards solutions and an element of therapeutic remembrance. Still an active movement, Ni Una Más continues to advocate for the awareness of victims of femicide, a process aided by artistic remembrance, academic legitimization and an unprecedented international court ruling.",276439491,,Dissertations & Theses," Upton, Sarah MeaganUptonMeaganSarahUpton, Sarah Meagan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2033434111 , 52041161 , 66569 , 9781109734751 , 1475353 , 1475353", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109734751, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/276439491?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy"," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy"," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy",," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy"," Womens studies , Communication , Criminology , Public policy"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Awareness , Border , Ciudad Juarez , Femicide , Mexico , Ni Una Mas , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Moving+beyond+awareness%3A+Ni+Una+M%C3%A1s+and+approaches+to+the+problem+of+femicide+in+Ciudad+Ju%C3%A1rez&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Upton%2C+Sarah+Meagan&amp;isbn=9781109734751&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"339,“A revolution we create daily”: Freegan alternatives to capitalist consumption in New York City,"New York City freegans are a group of critical consumption activists dedicated to limiting their impact on the environment, consumption of resources, and participation in what they argue is an exploitive capitalist economy. Perhaps best known for their ""trash tours"" of garbage in the city's streets and dumpsters, freegans participated in a variety of actions to highlight waste, create community and reclaim urban space. Participants in freeganism include high school teachers, corporate lawyers turned bike maintenance workers, squatters, college students, freelance employees, bike messengers, and retirees. Alternately defined as an anti-globalization, global justice or primitivist movement, the goals of freeganism often appear inconsonant with their tactics. Is freeganism an example of a postmodern movement responding to changes in contemporary organizing and social concerns, or is it a symptom of the society of spectacle they are critiquing? The use of dumpster diving as the primary recruitment tool for anti-capitalist organizing was a way to display excessive waste while simultaneously displaying freeganism as a solution but did this tactic obscure or enhance their message? Combining analysis of my participation in the freegan movement, interviews with freegans and an historical analysis of critical consumption movements in the United States, I learned about the complexities and contradictions freegans face in their use of radical democratic strategies to affect social, economic and political change. Freeganism is a reaction to and a product of a postmodern society of spectacle and capitalist hegemony and freegans' experiences illuminate the problems and solutions faced by other contemporary direct action movements. Using direct action theory as a starting point, this dissertation uses the stories and experiences of particular freegans along with descriptions of their various tactics to better understand how contemporary activists organize and what obstacles they are working to overcome. Freegans imagine a world that is free of the market rhetoric and capitalist hegemony and though they face many obstacles, they are in the process of discovering what it takes to create a postmodern consumer revolution.",305182414,,Dissertations & Theses," Ernst, KellyErnstKellyErnst, Kelly",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2041492641 , 52172371 , 66569 , 9781109739817 , 3406836 , 3406836", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109739817, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305182414?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Political science , Sustainability , Social structure"," Social sciences , Activism , Capitalism , Consumption , Direct action , Freeganism , New York , New York City , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CA+revolution+we+create+daily%E2%80%9D%3A+Freegan%0Aalternatives+to+capitalist+consumption+in+New+York+City&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ernst%2C+Kelly&amp;isbn=9781109739817&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"340,Global justice and the reform of the Bretton Woods regime,"My dissertation focuses on the problem of global justice (or cosmopolitanism) and its implications for international economic institutions, namely, the IMF and the World Bank. This is a topic that has recently attracted the attention of large audiences in academia, government and the general public. In the first part of my work, I explore theories of global economic justice in connection with questions of democratic governance. I focus especially on the governance of Bretton Woods institutions and I analyze rules affecting quota distributions, voting procedures and loan conditionality. The use of the latter by the IMF and the World Bank should call for heightened awareness of the biases that may result when implementing loan conditions in the developing world. Yet I find that global justice theorists tend to discuss the question of economic justice only at a highly abstract level. As a consequence, they have largely overlooked the power distortions implicit in the Bretton Woods regime. I then discuss some statist critiques of cosmopolitanism, which prove to be illuminating with respect to the past roles played by great powers in shaping the structures and policies of international financial institutions. I suggest ways in which both cosmopolitan and statist approaches could complement each other. The second part of the dissertation evaluates an empirical case of cosmopolitan activism. It describes the transnational advocacy campaign against ""structural adjustment"" (or neo-liberal policy conditionality) by the IMF and the World Bank. Drawing on the literature on social movements and the constructivist school of international relations theory, I argue that over the last three decades campaigners against neo-liberalism have incorporated many of the justice concerns raised by cosmopolitan theorists. As part of their strategy to reverse Bretton Woods sponsored neo-liberal reforms, I suggest activists have also grasped the necessity to engage with state actors in the global periphery. In the last chapter, I analyze the implications of global justice debates for the future of Bretton Woods and I review reform proposals that, critics believe, would contribute to increased fairness in the governance of international financial regimes.",305185420,,Dissertations & Theses," Ivanier, Ariel FernandoIvanierFernandoArielIvanier, Ariel Fernando",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1897989901 , 49417001 , 66569 , 9781109435528 , 3382525 , 3382525", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109435528, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305185420?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Political science , International law"," Social sciences , Bretton Woods , Development studies , Global justice , International financial institutions , International political economy , Political economy , Transnational activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+justice+and+the+reform+of+the+Bretton+Woods+regime&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ivanier%2C+Ariel+Fernando&amp;isbn=9781109435528&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"341,Transcendent reform: Quaker women and social reform during the Hicksite schism,"This thesis explores the role of Quaker women in social reform during the period from 1790-1920, particularly among the leading female reformers of the Northeast, focusing especially on the reforms of abolition, women's rights and peace witness. Nancy Hewitt's question is addressed; did the Hicksite schism lead to liberal reform among women? That is, were there positive repercussions from the Hicksite schism for women in the sense that the Hicksite schism became the platform for the women's movement, or that Hicksite Quaker women were far more involved in liberal social reforms than their Orthodox Quaker counterparts? 1 The study concludes that Hicksite and Orthodox Quaker women were equally involved in liberal social reform and activism, but that they differed primarily in the expression of their theological beliefs and hermeneutics. Certain radical theological beliefs of the Hicksites may have caused some historians to make assumptions that the Hicksites were more “liberal” in every way than the Orthodox, but in the core Quaker values which unite them in reform—their belief in peace, human equality and social justice, they were actually similar. As for the creation of the woman's rights movement, the study charts two theories of the creation of the women's movement—One that begins in Seneca Falls with the Women's Rights Convention of 1848 which involves predominantly Hicksite Quakers, and the second which sees the creation of the American women's rights movement evolving from the work of female abolitionists. This second theory focuses largely on Orthodox Quaker women. The study also describes how the creation of the American Friends Service Committee in the early 20 th century, as a merger of Hicksites and Orthodox Quakers concerned with peace and international humanitarian reform, served as an early healing of the Hicksite schism and symbolized the core Quaker values that characterized the denomination and united the reformers in their activities throughout the centuries. 1 The Quaker denomination split in 1828 into two divisions, Hicksite and Orthodox, and did not officially reunite until 1955. Nancy Hewitt is one of the only historians who suggests there might have been one positive outcome to the schism: women's reform.",305192724,,Dissertations & Theses," Cross-Hansen, JodyCross-HansenJodyCross-Hansen, Jody",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1978327941 , 51110561 , 66569 , 9781109640571 , 3396421 , 3396421", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109640571, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305192724?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," Religious history , American history , Womens studies , Quakers , Social change , Reforms , Religious orthodoxy"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , 1790-1920 , Hicksite schism , Northeastern U.S. , Quakers , Social reform , Women's reform , Women's rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transcendent+reform%3A+Quaker+women+and+social+reform+during+the+Hicksite+schism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cross-Hansen%2C+Jody&amp;isbn=9781109640571&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"342,American Muslims: A new Islamic discourse on religious freedom,"In 1998, the U.S. government made the promotion of religious freedom official policy. This policy has often been met with skepticism and hostility from foreign governments and publics. In the Muslim-majority world, it is commonly seen as an attempt to discredit traditional cultural norms and/or Islamic law, as covert support for American missionary activity, and/or as cultural imperialism. American Muslims could play a key role in changing this perception. To date, the American Muslim community has not become deeply invested in the movement for international religious freedom, but their notable absence has not been treated in any substantial length. This thesis draws on the disciplines of public policy, political science, anthropology, and religious studies to explore this absence, in the process attempting to clarify how the immigrant Muslim American community understands religious freedom. It reviews the exegetical study of Islamic sources in relation to human rights and democracy by three leading American Muslim intellectuals—Abdulaziz Sachedina, M.A. Muqtedar Khan, and Khaled Abou El Fadl—and positions their ideas within the dual contexts of the movement for international religious freedom movement and the domestic political incorporation of the Muslim American community. After comparing and contrasting their ideas, the thesis analyzes how their theory aligns with recent social, political, and economic developments in the broader Muslim-majority world. The history of the movement and subsequent policy encapsulates the challenges that Muslim Americans face such as interfaith relations, government scrutiny, and political empowerment. These challenges have to date constrained Muslim American support for U.S. religious freedom policy. Yet while slow and even hesitant to broadly support U.S. international religious freedom policy, Muslim Americans have embraced the cause of civil and religious liberty in their own domestic context, which in turn has generated new conceptual frameworks fusing Islamic principles and American values. These fusions, which orient toward theology, philosophy, and jurisprudence, respectively, combine an appeal to reason with sacred Islamic sources, providing a potential touchstone for future generations of Muslims both in the U.S. and abroad in which to anchor the promotion of religious freedom in the Muslim-majority world.",305203570,,Dissertations & Theses," Musselman, John C.

The movement has been damned as coercive in the name of conformity in the historical literature. This dissertation argues that Kellor's Americanization movement promoted immigrants and immigration, Americanized long-term Americans and their institutions as much as immigrants, and joined all residents in America via participation in progressive democratic activism. Kellor's Americanization programs were as aimed at social justice as the rest of her progressive work. Kellor was not against immigrants. Her earliest work with immigrants involved many protective measures that had already been established by immigrant community organizations. She protected immigrants from swindlers from the time they arrived to the time they left. She then started industrial protection advocacy with Lillian Wald. One of her organizations stopped legislation that would have shut down the foreign language press in America. And she constantly, and fiercely, fought against restricting immigration. The literature fails to acknowledge how much of the Americanization movement aimed at reforming American. Her theory held that exploiting and harassing immigrants made them discontent. Thus Americanization required banks, libraries, courts, and government agencies to welcome immigrants and accommodate their needs. State laws that abused immigrants and attempts to silence them were Anti-American. Kellor nearly never complained about immigrants. As seen in her harshest work Straight America, the vast majority of her wrath targeted the prejudice of long-term Americans and their ideas of Anglo-superiority. Kellor's Americanization efforts ultimately sought to Americanize via engaging immigrants and long-term Americans in progressive action. Her organizational style always coordinated and encouraged pre-existing activist groups rather than replacing them. Americanization Day got many sectors of society, immigrants and long-term Americans out in the streets together. Her curriculum advocated community activism as creating an investment and feeling of ownership in America. To better understand this tactic, her curriculum recommended reading John Dewey's work. Her idea for universal civilian training also sought to instill habits of civic participation. And, her curriculum and agenda stayed inclusive throughout World War I. Raised in poverty by a single mother, Kellor rose to the top of the progressive movement by recommending and engaging in progressive activism. Her seminal work on athletics advocated sports because they would make women active in the public sphere. Her book on domestic workers advocated a collective social network would mitigate their exploitation. Kellor's founding of the National Urban League also represented a blend of activist organizations. After leading Roosevelt's 1912 presidential campaign, Kellor - with the help of Jane Addams - established the activist wing of the Progressive Party in an attempt to run the nation on a cooperative participatory sociological basis. Her involvement in running the women's branch of Charles Evans Hughes' 1916 presidential campaign modeled these behaviors. And, Kellor ended her career by creating international cooperation via her American Arbitration Association. Because there were some who used the term 'Americanization' to harass immigrants, Kellor distanced herself from that label after World War I. But while many harassed immigrants under that banner, this was not - as the literature suggests - the only sort of Americanization program. Most historians acknowledge Kellor as the top claimant to the title of leader of the Americanization movement. As such she coordinated a vast amount of its activities. This dissertation shows that only portraying the Americanization movement as coercive and bent on conformity misses its progressive character and Kellor's importance as a theorist and leader.",305211691,,Dissertations & Theses," Press, JohnPressJohnPress, John",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1963553841 , 50812911 , 66569 , 9781109595468 , 3390447 , 3390447", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109595468, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305211691?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education"," 0304 Biographies , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education"," 0304 Biographies , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education",," 0304 Biographies , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education"," Biographies , Education history , Social studies education"," Social sciences , Education , Americanization , Culturism , Culturist , Democracy , Immigration , Kellor, Frances",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Frances+Kellor%2C+Americanization%2C+and+the+quest+for+participatory+democracy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Press%2C+John&amp;isbn=9781109595468&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"344,"Solidarity sometimes: Globalization, transnationalism, and the labor movement","This dissertation investigates the role of global labor in international relations. I argue that global labor is mainly comprised of two parts: national union organizations and Global Unions. Global Unions are transnational labor organizations (TLOs) with a worldwide membership that were created by national union organizations to represent their interests internationally. I contend that Global Unions perform five interrelated functions for national unions. However, due to the inherent structural weaknesses of Global Unions, it is the national unions that, in fact, remain the critical force behind global labor. Therefore, I focus on the transnational activities of national unions. I identify three conditions that result in incentives for unions to choose strategies of labor transnationalism: the shrinking of national political opportunity structures, the increasing availability of international political opportunity structures, and the adoption of a social union or social movement unionism paradigm for union revitalization. Additionally, I identify three factors that inhibit labor transnationalism among national unions: diminishing resources, turf wars, and cultural barriers. I introduce the concept of complex labor transnationalism as an alternative approach to the more limited traditional practice of labor transnationalism. I disaggregate the activities associated with complex labor transnationalism into six types: communicative transnationalism, political transnationalism, steward transnationalism, protest transnationalism, collaborative transnatonalism, and steward transnationalism. Furthermore, I conduct a case study on the state of labor transnationalism in the United States concluding that while most unions take a traditional approach towards labor transnationalism there is some evidence of complex labor transnationalism. Finally, I draw several conclusions about the role of global labor in international relations and outline three areas of potential growth.",305225832,,Dissertations & Theses," Rothermel, Jonathan C.RothermelC.JonathanRothermel, Jonathan C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1965402611 , 50852561 , 66569 , 9781109597783 , 3390517 , 3390517", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109597783, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305225832?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0629 Labor relations"," 0616 International law , 0629 Labor relations"," 0616 International law , 0629 Labor relations",," 0616 International law , 0629 Labor relations"," International law , Labor relations , Globalization , Case studies , International relations , Labor force"," Social sciences , Complex labor transnationalism , Global Unions , Globalization , International labor solidarity , Labor movement , Labor transnationalism , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solidarity+sometimes%3A+Globalization%2C+transnationalism%2C+and%0Athe+labor+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rothermel%2C+Jonathan+C.&amp;isbn=9781109597783&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"345,The interpretation of environmental sustainability (ES) by the IOC/Olympic Games 1994 - 2008,"The purpose of this qualitative multi-case study was to examine the interpretation of environmental sustainability (ES) within the Olympic Movement. Two research questions guided the inquiry - first, how has the concept of ES been defined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and second, how has the concept of ES been defined and enacted by the Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games (OCOGS)? During the past two decades, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) established several policies and programs related to ES. Its actions reflect a broader trend of environmentalism within economic and social spheres around the world (Milton-Smith, 2002). Despite the numerous initiatives, the Olympic Games continue to cause significant environmental damage. Frey, et al. (2007) argued that the Olympic Movement contradicts the fundamental premises of ES because the Games are hosted in a two week time period, are situated in a confined area, and accumulate operating and infrastructure costs in the billions of dollars. Further, Etzion (2007) stated ""there is positive and significant correlation between firm size and environmental performance"" (p. 642) and in the context of the Olympics the size impact relation is striking. Since 1972, the year the UN launched its international environmental awareness efforts, the Summer Olympics grew to 201 nations (39% increase), 10,500 athletes (32% increase), 28 sports (30% increase), and 302 events (43% increase) (Johnson, 2004; Girginov &amp; Parry, 2005; Upegui, 2008).

One of these alternatives, activist tourism, seeks to create opportunities for education, cultural exchange with local people, cross-cultural dialog regarding justice issues, and stimulate meaningful activism among tour participants. This study emerges in response to the need for more research and analysis of alternatives to traditional tourism, which have grown largely from both the ecotourism movement and increasing involvement of nonprofit organizations employing a tour aspect to their mission. This research will explore the community-based, activist tourism practiced by the Reality Tour Program sponsored by San Francisco-based Global Exchange, an international human rights organization, which promotes economic, social, political, and environmental justice. Focusing on the Global Exchange tour to the Caribbean side of Costa Rica on the theme of ecotourism and sustainability, this study seeks to use the touristic encounter between tour delegates, local guides and representatives of Costa Rican families and organizations as a space in which the conflicting experiences created by widespread ecotourism can be understood. Costa Rica, with its beautiful scenery, abundant resources, and diverse wildlife has made it an ecotourism mecca, which produces conflicting effects on the various communities in the country. Using participatory interviews among the four constituencies of this tour (the Global Exchange organization, the tour delegates, the Costa Rican tour leader, and spokespeople from local families and organizations who presented their stories in the tour encounters) and reviews of archival materials from previous Costa Rica tours, this study provides an opportunity to foreground the stories of local Costa Ricans about their experiences with ecotourism and related issues and to better understand the motivations, experiences, and possible transformation of tour delegates toward enhancing reflective capacity and social learning among providers of alternative tourism.",305238122,,Dissertations & Theses," Shinnamon, Felicia GobbaShinnamonGobbaFeliciaShinnamon, Felicia Gobba",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2042683871 , 52337301 , 66569 , 9781109760149 , 3407170 , 3407170", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109760149, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305238122?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0814 Recreation"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0814 Recreation"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0814 Recreation",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0814 Recreation"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies , Sustainability , Recreation"," Social sciences , Activist tourism , Costa Rica , Ecotourism , Emancipatory anthropology , Global exchange , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Activist+tourism%3A+Perceptions+of+ecotourism+and+sustainability+in+Costa+Rica&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shinnamon%2C+Felicia+Gobba&amp;isbn=9781109760149&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"348,"Wrestling with sustainability: Growth, land use development and the struggle for justice in Los Angeles","In the decades since the 1970s, major shifts in economic theory and political ideology have taken place, resulting in a widening gap between the rich and poor within and between the world's major economies—all occurring in the name of, and on behalf of, material growth. Urban centers responded accordingly to these shifts, allowing the emergence of development elites (growth machines) that dominated local government. These, in turn, have transformed into global cities where the support work for a global economy takes place. One of these is Los Angeles. These tectonic shifts have not occurred in a vacuum, however, nor have they occurred without protest and contestation. While the concept of an “alternative” society has been ideologically swept aside by the dominant world order of neoliberal capitalism, thousands of economic justice organizations have mobilized to not only protest these shifts but to struggle for a more just distribution of the economy’s wealth. Particularly in global cities and major urban centers, a type of activism emerged in the 1990s that contests the implementation of the neoliberal city. Known loosely as economic justice organizations, these groups identify grievances and make social movement claims regarding how their cities should be developed and grow, what should be built and who should build it, and how the social surplus from this development should be distributed. A new form of organizing, neither traditional community organizing nor community development practice itself, these organizations took root and grew in the interstices that opened during the transition from urban growth machine to global city. During the same period, environmental justice organizations have organized and grown. Using a “rights” frame, these groups protest the disparate environmental impacts of untrammeled growth on their communities and demand redistribution of environmental “bads” and “goods”. Although stemming from different positions within the dominant structure, these two forms of contestation have similar methods and have begun to work together in coalitions that did not exist two decades ago. I explore these organizations in Los Angeles, theorizing their political development as actors in the city-building process. I examine this process and question whether or not the combination of economic disparity and crisis, combined with ecological decline results in a questioning of neoliberal capitalism and its growth paradigm, whether or not these organizations and their campaigns reflect a systemic critique of the social order. I argue that the work of these two types of activism are, in fact, converging, and that this convergence may be theorized as a struggle for sustainable justice. I examine the role that the development of land use plays in this process of frame convergence and find that those organizations more closely engaged in coalitions and campaigns around issues of growth and development are the most likely to be incorporating a conjoined frame of sustainable justice. Although the work of these organizations can be theorized as counter-hegemonic, the limitations imposed by lack of an overarching political construct within which to nest these campaigns limits the systemic critique implicit in the demands. I suggest that these groups are transitional—their work lifts up the role of urban development and city-building—work that in a larger political framework may be the core of a social movement contesting both economic and ecological injustice.

The “culture wars” for the National Standards for History of 1994–1996 and quest for a further clarification of a national identity were also a part of two concomitant movements; the global standards movement in international education and also the domestic voluntary national standards movement in the core subjects (i.e., reading, mathematics, science and history) that was sponsored by governmental commissions and professional organizations. The acrimonious ideological and satirical rhetoric that was exchanged in the formation of the National Standards for History entangled historians, educators, curators, legislators, special interest groups, professional organizations, government agencies, think tanks and the media. In 1995, the contentious pathway eventually led to the censure of the National Standards for History in the United States Senate and with a process of consensus, a set of revised standards were issued and disseminated. In order to understand the prominence of the NHSP, a brief narrative overview is provided chronicling the seminal reform initiatives in history education beginning with the 1892 prestigious Committee of Ten. The need for the NHSP was precipitated by both the movement for national standards in learning and federal legislation that later impacted state and district curricula. Because the impact did not occur immediately, changes in local policies both with the Illinois Board of Education (ISBE) and the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) are chronicled to 2004, a decade after the National Standards for History were written. Topical issues in history education and accountability are also examined. Multiple sources of evidence were utilized in the research including oral history interviews (refer to Questionnaire, Appendix A) and documents and artifacts from the NHSP housed in the archives of the Charles E. Young Humanities Research Library at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). Archival materials are also referenced from the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) which demonstrate the curricular applications of the National Standards for History . According to Yin, the convergence of multiple sources of evidence including documents, archival records, open-ended interviews, primary and secondary sources provide an invaluable advantage in the case study strategy. 3 Although a critical first step was the creation of the voluntary National Standards for History to establish clear goals for learning and achievement to raise the overall quality of history education, currently, the implementation process of the history standards is not uniform in all of the states’ schools districts. Although generalizations are made to national trends and implications, this research study primarily focuses on the policies of ISBE and those of CPS. The conclusions reached in this qualitative study are: (1) that the National Standards for History impacted the ISBE history standards and those of CPS; (2) the state of history education is adversely affected by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) (2001) legislation to fully implement the history standards effectively and (3) educational policies and funding must be changed to ameliorate the accountability measures in assessing the performance of students to achieve the intended content and skills of the history standards. The implications for teacher preparation and certification in history and the social sciences are also examined for the promotion and sustainability of highly qualified teachers to ensure the mastery of the history standards in instruction. The contemporary advocacy movement in history and social science education by professional organizations is also discussed as well as the role of government in educational policy making including the issues of accountability and assessment. 3 Robert K.

It shows the mechanisms through which critical thinking and political opposition continued to operate in the shadow of the dominant discourses on security and threats which, after the terrorist attacks of September 11 th , attempted to impose a given narrative about security which relied on political consent as a security imperative. Treating this question from an international relations standpoint infused with sociological methods of inquiry, this project casts a different light on the actors relevant to the understanding of security policies. It demonstrates that the temptation of exceptionalism and the security discourses on which it relies are in constant evolution and modification depending on the waves that agitate the social fields that govern the enunciation of dominant discourses. To make these points, this thesis examines different social movements of opposition to the Patriot Act as well as the detention policies implemented during the war on terror and embodied by the detention camp of Guantanamo Bay. The reflection on these movements is interlaced within a larger analysis of the evolution of protest as a right and a social practice throughout the modern history of the United States in order to make sense of the contemporary forms of public political action. Eventually, this dissertation establishes that different forms of desecuritization are conceivable: repoliticization, rejudiciarization and the reform of the security measures that infringe on civil liberties in the name of the protection against a terrorist threat. Through a focalization on the role played by social actors and the use of sociological methods inspired by Bourdieu but also Edelman and Rogin, this project contributes to the critical approaches of security. It offers an alternative outlook on the Agambenian vision of the state of exception by denouncing the impression of fatality present in the Italian philosopher’s vision and insists, instead, on the resilience of key social actors such as librarians, civil liberties defense groups, lawyers and military personnel who, through their socialization, their professional ethics and values, managed to successfully resist the discourses of the administration and through institutional channels force it to the confines of its logic.

After World War II Americans traveled the world in unprecedented numbers, inspiring the sociologist Dean MacCannell to argue that tourists formed an emancipatory class whose world-historical consciousness centered on the creative use of leisure time. Many writers shared this idealism, although they did not try to instantiate McCannell’s social holism but rather valorized radically individualistic self-making. The ideology of this new global frontier complicates Edward Said’s model of the master-slave colonial binary, as post-WWII American travel narratives are simultaneously postcolonial and imperial. On one hand, writers resisted cultural hegemony and state control, fashioning prototypical models of hybrid selfhood and anticipating various developments in postmodern culture and theory. On the other hand, their vision of freedom was a specifically middle-class vision of liberated professionalism, a creative fusion of work and play that functioned to elide social inequality and marginalize collective struggles against oppression. White Flight argues that writers such as William S. Burroughs and Saul Bellow were therefore complicit with forms of neocolonial exploitation. The dissertation’s concluding chapter argues that Richard Wright wrote against frontier libertarianism and the escapism of a globalized “white flight,” as he imagined a postcolonial resistance movement that would extend middle-class self-empowerment to everyone. As a supporter of the Enlightenment and the work ethic of Protestantism, Wright problematizes our contemporary emphasis on cultural hybridity and the resistance of master narratives, arguing that a firm commitment to progress, education, and universal rationality in fact enables global mobility and cultural in-betweenness.",518697673,,Dissertations & Theses," Strand, EricStrandEricStrand, Eric",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2065696401 , 52898131 , 66569 , 9781124018195 , 3404657 , 3404657", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124018195, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/518697673?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Bellow, Saul , Burroughs, William S. , Diaspora , Fiction , Globalization , Middle class , Professionalism , Race , Travel , Travel writing , Wright, Richard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=White+flight%3A+Travel+writing%2C+globalization%2C+and+the+American+middle+class&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Strand%2C+Eric&amp;isbn=9781124018195&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"352,"The local politics of a global hotspot: Environmentalists, farmers, quilombolas, and nativos in Brazil's Atlantic Forest","The coastal Atlantic Forest in Southern Bahia, Brazil is the subject of an intense contemporary debate with broad social and environmental repercussions. Here, environmentalists, family farmers, quilombolas (Afro-Brazilian descendents of slaves living in quilombo communities), and nativos (people born in this region) compete and negotiate for control of some of the most ecologically significant and rapidly disappearing land on the planet. These interactions occur not only among people with deeply entrenched race, class, and ideological differences, but through separate social movements and activist groups that often hold conflicting positions. Environmentalists claim that land reform or independent family farmers near ecologically important areas pose threats to their conservation agenda. Family farmers resent natural areas being reserved for “plants rather than people” and complain an elitist environmental movement can be disconnected from the plight of the poor. In similar yet distinctive voices, quilombolas and nativos bemoan the loss of land and livelihood opportunities to what they view as esoteric environmental conservation, elites with capital and power, and neoliberal development. While in the past these groups have been able to pursue their goals in relative isolation or in collaboration with like-minded allies they must increasingly interact around common issues of ecology, economy, and culture that particularly impact their lives in what is known as a global “hotspot.” In this dissertation, I argue that differences in history, class, race, identity, subjectivity, and conceptions of place create important cultural politics that shape the relations among existing and emerging social movements and activist groups in Bahia’s Atlantic Forest. I particularly focus on group leaders as important conduits for revealing how cultural politics are often ignored or suppressed. I explore how histories of colonialism and clientalism, constraints of race and class, and forms of “othering” create distinct separations among contemporary social movements and activist groups and inhibit their present-day relations and ability to unite around powerful forces that threaten their way of life. I conclude that studying across social movements and activist groups is valuable for illuminating critical power inequities and, in turn, for creating new cultural politics that have important ramifications for people and place.",521854350,,Dissertations & Theses," Scanlan Lyons, Colleen M.Scanlan LyonsM.ColleenScanlan Lyons, Colleen M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2068108441 , 52925901 , 66569 , 9781109780871 , 3403979 , 3403979", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109780871, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/521854350?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Environmental Studies , Latin American Studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Atlantic forest , Brazil , Culture , Environmentalism , Politics , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+local+politics+of+a+global+hotspot%3A+Environmentalists%2C+farmers%2C+quilombolas%2C+and+nativos+in+Brazil%27s+Atlantic+Forest&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Scanlan+Lyons%2C+Colleen+M.&amp;isbn=9781109780871&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"353,"Urban agriculture as revolution: An action research and social movement analysis of food production in Alameda County, California","This dissertation examines characteristics of urban agriculture as a social movement using Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area as a study context. The overarching goals of this study were: (a) to add to the theoretical understanding of urban agriculture in the Global North; (b) to assess urban agriculture practitioners’ interest in receiving technical assistance from University of California Cooperative Extension, (UCCE); (c) to assess the possibilities for, and take steps toward, expanding UCCE assistance for a diversity of urban agriculture practioners. The study was conducted using an action research framework. Distinct characteristics of action research are: its attention to process; its dedication to motivating social change through research; and its emphasis on the interplay between theory and social action. Field research consisting of intensive interviews and site visits explored: social and geographic characteristics of 52 urban agriculture operations (farms, ranches, and gardens); challenges experienced by practioners; and types of assistance that would better enable operations to realize their goals. This information was analyzed using descriptive statistics and various social theories. GIS maps were created with site location and U.S. Census data. This enabled further geographic and demographic analysis. An additional data set consisted of UCCE agricultural advisors’ perspectives on urban agriculture. This information was collected through participant observation from within the University of California Small Farm Program and Small Farm Workgroup, both of which are part of California’s extension system. In concert with the practical focus of this work, this dissertation draws from several theoretical frameworks for its analysis of urban agriculture as a social movement. David Harvey’s (1973) work on revolutionary theory and Patricia Allen et al.’s (2003) study of California agrifood initiatives (AFIs) are central to this analysis. Discussion sections of this work center on a set of four themes derived from the field research. These themes are: (a) community gardening; (b) community food security/food justice/youth development; (c) sustainable living/self-provisioning; and d) commercial agriculture. Key findings and recommendations are presented in two chapters of this dissertation. Chapter 9 presents action recommendations focused on steps that could be taken to motivate and increase Cooperative Extension support for urban agriculture.

This study investigated how Freire’s idea of becoming fully human was exercised in a critical literacy curriculum with a privileged group of students. As a teacher and researcher, I constructed an after-school critical literacy curriculum about poverty with three Korean 6th graders from economically affluent backgrounds. Different instructional models of critical literacy (Busching &amp; Slesinger, 2002; Lewison et al., 2007) elaborated how students' resources should be reflected in a critical literacy curriculum. This research provides one example of how an instructional model of critical literacy can be unique, depending on students’ backgrounds. This study employs an integrated design of case study and teacher research. I used grounded thematic analysis, employing Strauss (1998) and Gee's (1999) discourse analysis to analyze cultural models and the world and political building tasks of the participants. I also used Appadurai (1996) for analyzing students’ movement across spaces. The findings indicated how students made use of their personal beliefs concerning poverty both to embrace and to resist the teacher's curricular moves. The students’ resistance demonstrated their unique movement without disrupting their cultural models of poverty. Tracking students’ transnational identities illustrated how students reconfirmed their life histories as hard-working individuals without challenging their privileges. While there were moments where students were critical about poverty, the development of critical consciousness was unique. Every student demonstrated his or her own ways to understand poverty. They also imposed their own life experiences and histories on the poor to imagine a way to help them. In the process, my approach of being direct and exploratory in terms of particular beliefs and ideologies about poverty interacted significantly with the students’ learning. Unique meanings derived from the critical social practices these particular individuals constructed emerged as a way to personalize a critical literacy curriculum. A discussion of how the transnational identity of students influenced their resistance as well as possible movement beyond their personal boundaries is included for its pedagogical utility.",598302511,,Dissertations & Theses," Huh, SeonminHuhSeonminHuh, Seonmin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2074798801 , 53223531 , 66569 , 9781124039282 , 3408079 , 3408079", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124039282, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/598302511?accountid=14496," 0279 Language arts , 0524 Elementary education , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0279 Language arts , 0524 Elementary education , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0279 Language arts , 0524 Elementary education , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0279 Language arts , 0524 Elementary education , 0727 Curriculum development"," Language arts , Elementary education , Curriculum development"," Education , Critical literacy , Critical literacy curriculum , Education for social justice , Elementary literacy , Literacy education , Transnationalism in critical literacy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=I+do+not+know+what+it+would+be+like+to+be+poor%3A+Learning+about%0Aprivileged+Korean+6th+graders%27+understanding+of+poverty&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huh%2C+Seonmin&amp;isbn=9781124039282&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"355,From margin to mainstream: The Jubilee 2000 campaign and the rising profile of global poverty issues in the United Kingdom and the United States,"In this dissertation, I examine the process by which social causes go from margin to mainstream—that is, how ideas once considered undesirable and unimportant become accepted as norms, either by a specific target audience or by society at large. I investigate the case study of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which advocated for debt cancellation for the world's poorest countries. This highly successful effort attracted a wide variety of powerful supporters, from Pope John Paul II and Bono (the musician) to Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Not only did it succeed in reforming international financial policy; it also tangibly set the stage for a variety of visible successor initiatives that have expanded resources and support from western countries to combat issues of global poverty. I combine scholarship on innovation and its diffusion with theoretical perspectives from performance studies to trace the series of interactions by which actors of (generally) lower status were able to convince more powerful institutions and individuals to take on the idea of debt cancellation as their own. The major argument of this study is about transforming the politics of scale inherent to current thinking about intentional social change efforts. I attempt to counter unrealistic expectations of about the magnitude and speed of social change by identifying the many complex forms of agency involved in such efforts, and delineating their relationship to the overall process by which a new idea becomes normative. Criticizing dominant trends in social entrepreneurship literature (which tends to focus mostly on the agency of ‘heroic’ individual leaders) and social movements literature (which tends to focus on collective agency), I frame the pursuit of social change as a granular, socially-embedded and contingent process that is always incomplete.

The global implications and replicability of Gawad Kalinga’s nation-building model on the emergence and development of other forms of social movements, civil society-state governance, and individual faith-in-action are compelling.

Linear models of knowledge transfer from one point to another have become secondary to knowledge exchanges where local contexts impact how multiple forms of knowledge emerge and are then shared. The direction of knowledge movement globally has become more complex as colonial dominance is transcended by narrative forms of knowledge arising from the social margins of the Global South and are incorporated into the worldviews of sympathetic advocates in wealthy Western countries. This dissertation investigates why and how narratives originating in the Global South are emergent in Canada. More specifically, the concepts that inform contemporary globalisation are presented though the lens of grade 10 social studies teachers in Alberta implementing a new social studies curriculum that not only magnifies the importance of global social structures on Canadian society, but also lends a critical eye towards social justice on a global scale. The use of narratives from the Global South supports a broad theorisation on the social phenomenon of global social justice as knowledge generated in social margins brings awareness to multiple forms of historical injustice that continue to be lived out around the world.",744392025,,Dissertations & Theses," Malcolm, GaryMalcolmGaryMalcolm, Gary",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2112877601 , 53928881 , 66569 , 9780494621639 , NR62163 , NR62163", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494621639, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/744392025?accountid=14496," 0534 Social studies education , 0700 Social structure , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0534 Social studies education , 0700 Social structure , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0534 Social studies education , 0700 Social structure , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0534 Social studies education , 0700 Social structure , 0727 Curriculum development"," Social studies education , Social structure , Curriculum development , Social justice , Alberta Canada , Canada"," Education , Social sciences , Alberta , Global social justice , Social studies classroom",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Changing+directions+in+development%3A+The+emergence+of+global+social+justice+in+the+social+studies+classrooms+of+Alberta+schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malcolm%2C+Gary&amp;isbn=9780494621639&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"358,Building a movement: Filipino American union and community organizing in Seattle in the 1970s,"The Asian American Movement emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, Antiwar Movement, Black Liberation Movement, and struggles for liberation in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Activists, including college students and community members throughout the United States, used “mass line” tactics to raise political awareness, build organizations, address community concerns, and ultimately to serve their communities. While the history of the Asian American Movement has been chronicled, the scholarship has been analytically and theoretically insufficient -and in some cases nonexistent- in terms of local struggles, how the movement unfolded, and the role of Filipino Americans. This dissertation focuses on one, untold story of the Asian American Movement: the role of activists in Seattle, Washington who were concerned with regional injustices affecting Filipino Americans. I argue that this local struggle in the Pacific Northwest not only demonstrates the diversity of action and strategy within the Asian American Movement but also deepens our understanding of the broader movement as both local and transnational – unique in its local strategies yet closely aligned with the goals of the era’s social movements. Based on both historical and qualitative data, this dissertation uses a Gramscian framework to explore the possibilities and limitations of using civil society as instruments for social change. Specifically, I examine the efforts by a group of local activists in the 1970s to seek redress for the exclusion, discrimination and social dislocation experienced by Filipino Americans. I explore two local Asian American Movement case studies in which activists worked within two preexisting organizational formations of civil society, the Alaska Cannery Worker’s Union and the Filipino Community of Seattle, to achieve their goals. This dissertation sheds light on the evolution of their organizing strategies and tactics with regard to broader processes of community and identity formation, as well as to their aims of bringing about revolutionary change. My research explored the following questions about attempts to serve and support the Filipino American community in Seattle in the 1970s: First, how do processes of community, identity, and ideological formation shape social movement organizing strategies? And second, how have changing patterns of immigration, institutional community formation, and international movement ideology shaped the strategies used by activists organizing on behalf of the Filipino American community in Seattle, Washington? I argue that the efforts to organize in support of the Seattle Filipino American community in the 1970s unfolded in two phases. In the first phase, the activists were influenced and guided by the Civil Rights Movement and the ideas of the larger Asian American Movement. These movements provided activists with a framework from which to understand their grievances and activists started organizing using a Civil Rights and equity-based framework to address grievances and achieve social reforms. However, the declaration of martial law in the Philippines in 1972 coincided with a fracture within the Filipino American community in Seattle because one group of activists experienced an ideological shift to a more radical viewpoint. This schism amongst the activists and within the larger Filipino American community was complicated by differences based on time of immigration, class, and generation and was manifested in political questions regarding the mission, goals, and use of both the Filipino Community of Seattle and the Cannery Worker’s Union. In the second phase of organizing, the radical activists were no longer intent on just reforming these local organizations; they also had a broader political agenda, and their organizing strategies changed to reflect this ideological shift. I argue that the strategy of the activists in this second phase was what Gramsci calls a “War of Position,” meaning that the activists tried to use civil society institutions – a non-profit and community organization and a union – as a means to build a social movement and as a way to wage an attack on the state. Ultimately, the findings of this study challenge previous claims that the Asian American Movement was either reformist or radical. In this case study of Filipino American activists in Seattle, the data demonstrates that they were agents for social reform and also revolutionaries, not one or the other. The findings of this study point to the need for more nuanced and complex frameworks for understanding social change processes and organizing strategies.",748918804,,Dissertations & Theses," Domingo, Ligaya ReneDomingoReneLigayaDomingo, Ligaya Rene",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2126261051 , 54172051 , 66569 , 9781124140483 , 3413353 , 3413353", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124140483, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/748918804?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," Asian American Studies , Ethnic studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Asian-American movement , Civil society , Filipino-American , Labor , Organizing , Social movement , Washington",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+a+movement%3A+Filipino+American+union+and+community+organizing+in+Seattle+in+the+1970s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Domingo%2C+Ligaya+Rene&amp;isbn=9781124140483&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"359,"Fabled futures: Development, gridiron football, and transnational movements in American Samoa","For over a hundred years since the chiefs ( matai ) of Tutuila and Manu'a signed the deeds of cession that submitted the islands to United States' sovereignty, the question of how to reap the benefits of association while maintaining indigenous customs has been an issue for American Samoans. Taking the phenomenon of American football as a crucial strand of development on the island since the 1960s, this dissertation traces its establishment and evolution on the island of Tutuila over the past fifty years, investigating how it has become a significant path of transnational movement, and a source of social mobility, status and prestige. In a local political economy in which rapid population growth and limited economic opportunity induce continuous migration to the United States, football represents a relatively new form of labor and transnational movement for many Samoans. I draw on my ethnographic research to show the many dimensions of this experience and to trace the forms of capital players seek through football success. I argue that for many Samoan players the transformation of subjectivity and the body in accumulation of what I call ""gridiron capital"" is crucial to their success in the football context, but their connection to family and community provides other measures of worth that allow them to resist further commodification driven by the capitalist logic that permeates the sport. I argue that transnational movements and access to alternative sources of status and prestige such as those associated with football success, have precipitated important shifts in the constituent concepts and recognized indigenous practices of tautua and the fa'amatai over time. In some ways football success, like many other foreign imports before it, is both reincorporated by the powerful logic of the fa'asamoa and the matai system, and serves to undermine existing social hierarchies and the relations of power that structure them. I suggest that one result of the growth of particular kinds of gendered institutions in American Samoa (especially the military, government, and sport) has been the elevation of embodiments and iconographies of male authority and prestige that have narrowed the field of possibility for gendered social relations.",749402769,,Dissertations & Theses," Uperesa, Fa' anofo LisaclaireUperesaanofo LisaclaireFa'Uperesa, Fa' anofo Lisaclaire",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2128980911 , 51288061 , 66569 , 9781124174044 , 3420691 , 3420691", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124174044, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/749402769?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation"," Cultural anthropology , History , Social structure , Recreation"," Social sciences , Development , Football , Labor , Matai , Migration , Samoa , Sport",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fabled+futures%3A+Development%2C+gridiron+football%2C+and+transnational+movements+in+American+Samoa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Uperesa%2C+Fa%27+anofo+Lisaclaire&amp;isbn=9781124174044&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"360,"Dealing with historical issues in Japan and Germany: Ruling coalitions, transnational activism, and conservative reaction","When and why does a perpetrator state take a more penitent stance on its past injustices? This dissertation explores the variations in Japan’s and Germany’s choice of history policy, mainly through the comparative study of common historical issues—sexual slavery, forced labor, and biased history textbooks. I test and compare two competing approaches to explain the variance in the two states’ behavior toward these historical problems. A realist approach argues that geopolitical incentives are the driving force behind a state’s penitence regarding past transgressions. A transnational-coalitional approach—newly combined for this study—posits that a perpetrator state will adopt more penitent attitudes toward its past wrongs when transnational activism is powerful and the state is led by a progressive ruling coalition. Transnational actors push the state to adopt more conciliatory policies toward past misdeeds by disseminating information, engaging in persuasion, and exerting pressure. Progressive governing elites, who have a strong motive for promoting human rights and social justice, listen to and take into account the voices requesting redress for unresolved historical issues from transnational actors. The case studies show that the two approaches are not mutually exclusive but complementary despite the relative strength of transnational-coalitional approach. The effect of transnational activism is heightened when the target state is faced with other geopolitical incentives and/or when the target state is led by a progressive ruling coalition. The Japanese state, for example, responded to the transnational comfort women movement in a somewhat conciliatory manner between 1993 and 1995 when building better ties with Asia was in its security interest and a liberal, non-LDP coalition briefly took power. Similarly, the German state took a more conciliatory stance on the forced labor issue when the progressive SPD/Green Party led a coalition government and German business interests were at stake in the U.S. market during the late 1990s. The transnational German-Polish History Textbook Commission played a key role in improving the German historical narrative and its textbook policy regarding Poland, particularly as the progressive SPD-FDP coalition supported the Commission and such action was very much in keeping with German security interests during the 1970s. In the 2000s, on the other hand, transnational activism regarding history textbooks had a limited impact on the Japanese historical narrative and its textbook policy given, in large part, the strengthened U.S.-Japan security alliance and the conservative governing coalition led by the LDP.",749787774,,Dissertations & Theses," Ku, YangmoKuYangmoKu, Yangmo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2132315411 , 50272451 , 66569 , 9781124149561 , 3413641 , 3413641", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124149561, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/749787774?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0615 Political science"," Asian Studies , European Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Conservative reaction , Germany , Historical issues , Japan , Ruling coalitions , Transnational activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dealing+with+historical+issues+in+Japan+and+Germany%3A+Ruling+coalitions%2C+transnational+activism%2C+and+conservative+reaction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ku%2C+Yangmo&amp;isbn=9781124149561&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"361,"Gaps, flows, and networks: Social space and the cultural work of communication theory in social science, sci-fi, and political movements, 1937–1980","This dissertation examines the disparate theories of mass communication produced and circulated by social scientists, through films and the popular press, and political activist movements between the late 1930s and the end of the 1970s. It analyzes communication theory as a cultural practice, not limited to academic scholarship, that helps imagine and create different kinds of social spaces to support state and oppositional politics. I basically argue that the theoretical concern with media effects rested on visions of the social spaces audiences inhabited. This construction of different models of this social space was a cultural practice that accompanied propaganda politics, media reform discourse, and the strategies of political movements and thus extended beyond academic institutions into popular culture, the media professions, and movement politics. Communication theories were mobilized to interpret particular social groups (the national populace, African American activists, second wave feminists) and their relationship to the mass media of the United States. I outline the imaginative mappings of social spaces that were at the center of communication research in the 1940s and 1950s about the impact of commercial media. This work relied on ideas about the passage of mass communication through space in order to negotiate between the worries about propaganda and the hope of preserving democratic discourse. The dissertation then traces the construction of a global communication space in early Cold War science fiction films; and it shows that these films engaged concerns about communication technologies and propaganda and that the cinematic interpretations resonated strongly with academic theories. In the second part, the dissertation juxtaposes these official theories with the theories articulated within political movements, namely the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and second wave feminism in the 1970s as the liberal mainstream magazine Ms. represented it. In their critiques of commercial media, the Black Arts activists and the feminists of Ms. analyzed media hegemony and mapped social spaces that functioned as sites for oppositional media practices. Their takes on the underlying problem of a functioning public sphere provided the ferment for the turn in media scholarship toward Cultural Studies and Marxism in the 1980s.",749934669,,Dissertations & Theses," Lierow, LarsLierowLarsLierow, Lars",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2133367881 , 51557501 , 66569 , 9781124153506 , 3413834 , 3413834", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124153506, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/749934669?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," African American Studies , American studies , Black history , Social research , Womens studies , Political science , Mass communications , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Black Arts movement , Communication theory , Feminism , Media activism , Propaganda , Science fiction , Science fiction films , Social space",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gaps%2C+flows%2C+and+networks%3A+Social+space+and+the+cultural+work+of+communication+theory+in+social+science%2C+sci-fi%2C+and+political+movements%2C+1937%E2%80%931980&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lierow%2C+Lars&amp;isbn=9781124153506&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"362,"In search of movement: Italy's “movimento dei movimenti,” theoretical-practice and re-making the political","My dissertation is an effort to rethink our understanding of social movements and politics, taking a movement’s own production of meanings, knowledge and theoretical-practices as key to such renewed understanding. By looking at Italy’s “movimento dei movimenti”(MoM), a movement that is considered part of the global wave of protest launched in Seattle, and made most visible on occasions like the violent protests against the G8 in 2001, I argue that social movements cannot be understood using traditional conceptions or theoretical frameworks for such an endeavor. Traditional approaches treat movements as objectively definable entities, delimitable in time, place and to a particular set of concrete demands and objectives. However, my sustained ethnographic research revealed that this movement, was comprised as much by the narratives, descriptions and stories about it, as it was by any material or political reality that constituted it. In fact, with its multiple levels of action and presence, it should be understood as a space and meaning-making tool for developing new political practices, for re-imagining the political, and for producing new visions and subjects of social change. Building on diffuse collective knowledge of both the past failures of traditional politics and new theoretical and practical insights, Italian activists have worked to create novel forms of cultural-political mobilization that have at their center political and ethical commitments to difference, partiality, reflexivity, and autonomy. Central to the emergence of these features are reflective and theoretical-practices that help to create the conditions of possibility for transformative social change, through cultivating critical ethical subjects, non-dogmatic knowledges, as well as practices and lifestyles that reflect these. Building on insights from a wide variety of disciplines, including cultural studies, anthropology, geography, and political theory, I argue that social movements must be understood not simply as oppositional entities, but also as sophisticated knowledge producers, contributing to the creation or consolidation of a “new political imaginary.”",751336206,,Dissertations & Theses," Osterweil, MichalOsterweilMichalOsterweil, Michal",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2140499901 , 52209931 , 66569 , 9781124172811 , 3418729 , 3418729", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124172811, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/751336206?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," Cultural anthropology , Political science"," Social sciences , Epistemology , Italy , Movimento dei movimenti , Political , Social change , Social movements , Theoretical-practice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+search+of+movement%3A+Italy%27s+%E2%80%9Cmovimento+dei+movimenti%2C%E2%80%9D+theoretical-practice+and+re-making+the+political&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Osterweil%2C+Michal&amp;isbn=9781124172811&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"363,Rights approaches: Case studies in Egypt and Liberia,"Human rights advocacy varies across countries due to state policies, violations, organizational resources and networks.

Local organizations play a vital role in the international human rights movement as information gatherers, trend setters and translators of the human rights regime into diverse local environments.

However, they were seldom included by the public health community while designing prevention and treatment programs and policies. Soon after 1999 when young leaders took it upon themselves and began championing HIV/AIDS efforts in different parts of the world, it was clear that the lack of synergy and coordination among these efforts was resulting in minimal overall impact. In 2004, a group of youth leaders conceived the Global Youth Coalition for HIV/AIDS (GYCA) to address this issue. The mission of the GYCA was to optimize the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to synergize youth efforts globally, and empower young people with the knowledge, resources and skills to fight the epidemic. GYCA uses a range of Internet-based tools and activities such as online resources, a listserv, e-consultations and e-courses to achieve their mission. The performance and growth of online health movements such as GYCA is determined to a great extent by the participation of their members. This study examined the various factors that facilitated or impeded online participation of young people in GYCA’s online activities. Perspectives from four conceptual domains—public health, social informatics, social movements and computer-mediated communication—informed this research. Together, these literatures suggest that a range of contextual factors at different levels of the social ecology influence online participation. The main focus of this study was to explore which intrapersonal, social psychological and technological factors influence participation in GYCA’s online activities. In addition, I tested a trans-disciplinary conceptual framework which hypothesized a causal pathway: contextual factors influence online participation which enhances the perceived utility of online social networking leading to perceptions about program effects. In doing so, the study employed a mixed-methods design: qualitative in-depth interviews of GYCA leaders informed a cross-sectional online survey of GYCA’s membership. The interviews were conducted through email and online chat while the online survey was administered on SurveyMonkey using stratified sampling based on region and tenure of membership with the coalition. Statistical analyses comprised chi-square tests and linear and logistic regression modeling using standardized weights. Overall, 275 GYCA members responded to the survey – nearly 50% from Africa, and approximately 24% each from Americas/Europe &amp; Asia. Nearly 75% of respondents reported participating in the listserv, 19% in the e-consultation and 25% in the e-course. Regression analyses showed that overall intrapersonal factors were least predictive of online engagement, social psychological factors were strong predictors, and technological factors were strongest. Social networking utility proved a critical mediator between online participation and perceived program effects. I concluded that contextual factors influence participation of young people in an online health social movement such as the GYCA. The influence of these factors on online participation may differ by the type of online activity. From a programmatic standpoint, it is important to recognize that a complex range of intrapersonal, social psychological and technological forces shape participation in online health movements that eventually aim to influence health outcomes. From an academic perspective, trans-disciplinary approaches are useful and essential to conducting robust, holistic inquiries into online health movements. Further research needs to be conducted on developing a conceptual framework such as the one tested in this study, for more thoroughly examining processes of causes and effects relating to the use of ICTs in public health.",753940008,,Dissertations & Theses," Vijaykumar, SantoshVijaykumarSantoshVijaykumar, Santosh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2145921201 , 54556001 , 66569 , 9781124198507 , 3419737 , 3419737", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124198507, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/753940008?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0573 Public health , 0602 Behavioral Sciences"," 0459 Communication , 0573 Public health , 0602 Behavioral Sciences"," 0459 Communication , 0573 Public health , 0602 Behavioral Sciences",," 0459 Communication , 0573 Public health , 0602 Behavioral Sciences"," Communication , Public health , Behavioral Sciences"," Health and environmental sciences , Communication and the arts , Psychology , Aids , Global health , Hiv , Internet , Online , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+health+2.0%3A+Youth%2C+Internet%2C+and+the+fight+against+HIV%2FAIDS&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vijaykumar%2C+Santosh&amp;isbn=9781124198507&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"365,"Grassroots, activist newspapers from civil rights to the twenty-first century: Balancing loyalties and managing change","Journalism historians have addressed the important role that ethnic and gay/lesbian media have played within their communities and as part of a broader media landscape. And alternative media and social movement scholars have discussed how activists engage with communication inside and outside social movements. These two conversations—one about grassroots media that represent ethnic or gendered communities and another about activist media that address social movement agendas—are brought together in this dissertation. This research looks at media that emerged during a robust time of research and practice in U.S. journalism and communication history. The global push for civil rights in the 1960s and 1970s influenced activists and journalists who in turn founded media outlets. Some publications from this time lasted only a few years. But others published longer. The International Examiner, serving Pan-Asian and Asian American communities, and the Seattle Gay News, serving gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities, are two examples of user-generated, political communication from this era. Each published in Seattle, Washington. Each published for more than thirty-five years. Interviews with newspaper workers, qualitative content analysis of newspapers, and examination of archival records suggest several nuances about their loyalties to community, activism, and journalism, as well as patterns about how each newspaper organization changed over time. There are several ideas discussed in this project that media and communication scholars interested in journalism history, media organizations, and political communication should think about. First, alternative media's friendlier relationship between movement and media appear to influence how these media operate and what is produced as content. Second, publications might balance a duality of memberships—community and journalism, and community and activism. Third, alternative media's critique of dominant journalism practices, such as stereotyping and prioritization of stories, might also involve engaging mainstream media and their audiences. Fourth, alternative media sometimes criticize factions within their own communities as they balance their loyalties to journalism and political leanings. Fifth, grassroots, activist newspapers might change over time via phases, such as sponsoring, separating, stabilizing, and surviving. And finally, organizational structures and choices can shape how these media develop over time and possibly survive.",756250869,,Dissertations & Theses," Gustafson, Kristin L.GustafsonL.KristinGustafson, Kristin L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2153461481 , 52073131 , 66569 , 9781124227962 , 3421785 , 3421785", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124227962, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/756250869?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0708 Mass communications",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," Asian American Studies , Journalism , GLBT Studies , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Activism/social movement , Activist newspapers , Alternative media , Ethnic/Asian American , Gender/gay/lesbian , Grassroots media , Journalism history , Loyalties , Newspaper organization , Washington",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grassroots%2C+activist+newspapers+from+civil+rights+to+the+twenty-first+century%3A+Balancing+loyalties+and+managing+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gustafson%2C+Kristin+L.&amp;isbn=9781124227962&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"366,"Waiting for Maitreya: Of gifting statues, hopeful presents and the future tense in FPMT's transnational Tibetan Buddhism","In this multi-sited ethnography, I examine the controversial plans and practices of the Maitreya Project, which hopes to offer a multi-million dollar ""gift"" of the world's biggest statue to India. The Maitreya Project operates under the auspices of FPMT, a transnational Tibetan Buddhist group. My examination of holy objects in FPMT centers in India elucidates how taking the ""social life of things"" seriously sheds new light onto ritual and social performances of identity construction. During my research period, local Indian farmers in Kushinagar were vehemently protesting against the Maitreya Project; farmers argued that they will be disenfranchised by the state's application of eminent domain to acquire their farmlands for the statue. Thus, I also engage with the emergent grassroots movements and the dynamics of People's Struggles vis-à-vis the current era of rapid globalization and development in India. Writing a ""cultural biography"" of the giant statue of Maitreya, then, provides a unique opportunity to observe two communities engaging with their many histories and futures through the virtual body of a sacred object. I first investigate the central, albeit contested, place of the mammoth 500-foot Maitreya Project statue in the development of a transnational Tibetan Buddhist religious community almost exclusively comprised of Western and Asian converts as likely to hail from Switzerland as Singapore. Second, I trace the trajectories of my Buddhist informants' changing notions of hope and temporality regarding Maitreya himself, their future statue of the future Buddha, and their own karmic futures, especially as regards reformulations of Buddhist morals and ethics in the face of various unanticipated ""karmic obstacles"" to their desires (such as protests by local Indian farmers). Third, I endeavor to understand FPMT's practice of gifting holy objects—giant statues, microscopic relics, and other Buddhist bodies—in terms of both karmic exchanges and socio-economic development benefits, through a close examination of individual donations, ritual offerings, and ""engaged,"" Buddhist humanitarian works. My work takes classic ritual, gift exchange, temporality, and development literatures in new directions by writing them through both Western academic discourses and Buddhist social theories, such as the Madhyamika framing of ""emptiness.""",756452875,,Dissertations & Theses," Falcone, Jessica MarieFalconeMarieJessicaFalcone, Jessica Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2154368441 , 51082011 , 66569 , 9781124132921 , 3416947 , 3416947", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124132921, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/756452875?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Futurity , Holy objects , Maitreya Buddha , Material culture , Tibetan Buddhism , Transnational buddhism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Waiting+for+Maitreya%3A+Of+gifting+statues%2C+hopeful+presents+and+the+future+tense+in+FPMT%27s+transnational+Tibetan+Buddhism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Falcone%2C+Jessica+Marie&amp;isbn=9781124132921&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"367,"Conflicts of solidarity: Nuclear weapons, liberation movements, and the politics of peace in the Federal Republic of Germany, 1945-1975","After 1945, the German politics of peace – against war and among activists – was defined by the emerging and interpenetrating geopolitical regimes of the Cold War and decolonization. These unprecendented international conditions forced pacifists to rethink their existing agendas. Peace rhetoric that once had focused on the domestic roots of militarism was reoriented to emphasize human dignity as a positive leitmotif. Was this a sufficient response to the deployment of modern weapons in an ideologically-grounded and potentially global conflagration? What sort of position were pacifists to take on anticolonial wars like those fought in Algeria or Vietnam, which many activists perceived as being fought in the name of human dignity? These and similar questions vexed West German pacifists and led to a series of crises among them. This dissertation explores the historically-contingent nature of pacifism as it was articulated and practiced in the Federal Republic of Germany on the shifting terrains of geopolitics, political economy, and activist networking. At its core, this is a history of peace organizations and their respective attempts to revive pacifism in Germany after World War II, adjust their priorities to the geopolitical and domestic political priorities of the Cold War, and accommodate themselves to a new era of social movement organizing and activism. I demonstrate a global turn in pacifist thought during the 1950s, and I argue that this shift encouraged pacifist identification with and support for national liberation movements around the world during the 1960s, leading some activists to seriously qualify their traditional opposition to the violence of war. Pacifists thus found themselves caught between affective expressions of solidarity and political movements that thematized exploitation in such a way as to elevate human dignity above the sanctity of human life. Resisting the common characterization of protest as an expression of youthful, countercultural dissent, I identify the competing influences of broader cultural economies over peace activism. The historical trajectory that I map enables further analyses of pacifist relationships to local, regional, and transnational public cultures; of protest as a mode of remembrance; and of the influence of peace politics over West Germany's evolving political culture.",756452922,,Dissertations & Theses," Oppenheimer, Andrew GlennOppenheimerGlennAndrewOppenheimer, Andrew Glenn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2154368461 , 53246151 , 66569 , 9781124197937 , 3419680 , 3419680", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124197937, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/756452922?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies"," European history , Peace Studies"," Social sciences , Germany , Liberation movements , Nuclear weapons , Pacifism , Peace , Social movements , Solidarity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conflicts+of+solidarity%3A+Nuclear+weapons%2C+liberation+movements%2C+and+the+politics+of+peace+in+the+Federal+Republic+of+Germany%2C+1945-1975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Oppenheimer%2C+Andrew+Glenn&amp;isbn=9781124197937&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"368,A comparative study of Chinese and Mexican immigrants' economic incorporation in the United States,"This dissertation research is a comparative study of the economic incorporation of the unskilled Chinese and Mexican immigrants in the United States. This comparative approach is justified by the fact that these two groups share striking similarities in human capital, social networks, and immigrant flow patterns, whereas they also differ significantly in their migration cost, transnational practice, and reception in the U.S. labor market. This research investigates three specific aspects of their labor market experience: participation in self-employment, job transition, and earnings growth. Essentially I hope to find out whether these immigrants can achieve economic mobility over time and in what forms. To explain the variation in immigrants' labor market performance, I examine the effects of a series of factors, including assimilation, transnationalism, and other factors pertaining to the contexts of exit and reception. One particular point of inquiry is immigrants' job placement in nontraditional destination areas and the economic consequences associated with that movement. This is mainly a quantitative study, using data from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP) and the China International Migration Project (CIMP). Besides descriptive statistics I employ a series of multivariate methods in my analyses, including logistic regression, discrete-time logit model, event history proportional hazard model, and fixed-effects and random-effects models. In addition, I utilize the qualitative information collected from the in-depth interviews with select Chinese immigrants in New York City in order to corroborate and complement the quantitative results. This study finds many similarities between the two groups' labor market experience. These include their occupational status, patterns of job transitions within the U.S., and the influence of pre-migration endowment on their entrepreneurial attainment in the host society. Furthermore, both groups show an increasing trend of working in their nontraditional destination areas, very likely due to the reduced job competition and higher wages there. But they differ vastly in their labor market niches, including participation in self-employment and employment by coethnics, which lead to important differences in their economic well-being. In addition, intensive transnational practice and exorbitant migration cost constitute unique forces in affecting the incorporation experiences of Mexican and Chinese immigrants respectively.",756745473,,Dissertations & Theses," Chunyu, MiaoChunyuMiaoChunyu, Miao",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2155585401 , 54746351 , 66569 , 9781124201399 , 3419811 , 3419811", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124201399, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/756745473?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0510 Economics , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0938 Demography"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0510 Economics , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0938 Demography"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0510 Economics , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0938 Demography",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0510 Economics , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0938 Demography"," Asian American Studies , Economics , Hispanic American studies , Demography"," Social sciences , Chinese , Chinese immigrant , Comparative research , Economic incorporation , Ethnic economy , Immigrant integration , Immigrants , Labor market , Mexican , Mexican immigrant",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+comparative+study+of+Chinese+and+Mexican+immigrants%27+economic+incorporation+in+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chunyu%2C+Miao&amp;isbn=9781124201399&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"369,Developing a definition of well-being to assess human rights documents,"Human well-being, although a frequent part of social policy discourse, is not clearly defined. A clear definition of well-being can be a tool for policy development, analysis, and social change. In order to better understand well-being, individual and collective human needs must be adequately examined. The following six interrelated dimensions of universal human needs, derived from social, psychological, and human development theory, can be used to understand well-being: biological-material needs, social-psychological needs, productive-creative needs, security needs, self-actualization needs, and spiritual needs (Fromm,1975; Gil,1992; Maslow, 1970). In this study a definition of well-being is developed based on the aforementioned six universal human needs. This definition is used to examine United Nations (UN) human rights documents and the constitutions and levels of well-being of nine selected nations. The research, which involves social and philosophical exploration of human needs, rights, and well-being, is conducted through four foci. Focus One defines wellbeing using the six interrelated universal human needs; this definition is subsequently used as a theoretical framework for the other three research foci. Focus Two examines the extent to which UN human rights documents are compatible with the definition of well-being; the UN human rights documents that are examined include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Focus Three examines the extent to which the constitutions of nine selected nations are compatible with the definition of well-being; the nations that are studied include the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and four additional nations—Brazil, Rwanda, Sweden, and Vietnam. Focus Four assesses the extent to which circumstances of living in these nine nations correspond to the dimensions of well-being assured by their constitutions; the well-being definition is used as the basis to select social, economic and health indicators from existing global data sources and compose data sets for the nine nations in order to make this assessment. UN treaties, constitutions of nations, and aggregate global resources suggest the theoretical possibility of well-being for world citizens. Despite this possibility, no single nation has achieved well-being, though some nations have better human needs outcomes than others. The separation between theoretical and manifest well-being is explained through historic choices that cultures have made with respect to social justice. Based on the research findings, it is suggested that broad social movements become the impetus to achieve global well-being.

First, it places the emergence of the social forum phenomenon in the broader transformations towards neoliberal capitalism. It thus puts renewed emphasis on the often side-stepped structuring power of capitalism and class as analytic lenses for a deeper understanding of the alter-globalization movement in general and social forum process in particular. From this vantage point, movements and groups of the alter-globalization movement are not merely unconnected struggles over the particular but they are potential instantiations of struggles over class formation. Social forums are then arenas for convergences that could lead to a new 21 st century class formation; a class formation keyed to neoliberal capitalism that would take on a very different form than during Fordism. Second, the study analyzes the social forum process—or what I am calling the ""Global Social Forum Rhizome""—as a strategic instrument of the alter-globalization movement by examining them as ""resistance relays."" I suggest that social forums' unique organizational matrix has allowed for an ongoing process of 'becoming-other-together.' Social forums as relays provide the context and act as catalyst for generating linkages, mobilizations and convergences of this multi-centered ""movement of movements."" As such, social forums can be understood as instantiations of an emerging new stage in social movement based organizing, which the study labels the ""Rhizomatic Left."" However, the anarchist-inspired politics of social forums generate their own limits and shortcomings that this dissertation also addresses. The study stretches across various physical and virtual sites. The research relied on two main strategies: following online social forum related discussion and conducting on-site field work at social forums in addition to critically reviewing various academic literatures on social movements in general and social forums in particular.",759985063,,Dissertations & Theses," Funke, Peter NikolausFunkeNikolausPeterFunke, Peter Nikolaus",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2173043831 , 53237781 , 66569 , 9781124276601 , 3429164 , 3429164", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124276601, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/759985063?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0344 Social research , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," Social research , International Relations , Political science"," Social sciences , Capitalism , Globalization , Neoliberal , Resistance relay , Social movement , World Social Forum",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Global+Social+Forum+Rhizome%3A+The+World+Social+Forum+as+resistance+relay+and+social+movement+politics+in+neoliberal+capitalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Funke%2C+Peter+Nikolaus&amp;isbn=9781124276601&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"371,"Degeneration nation: The body, medicine, and the culture of biofuturity in American literature, 1883-1928","“Degeneration Nation: Reproduction, Disability, and Biofuturity in American Literature, 1880-1930” disentangles the relationship between Progressive Era American fiction and eugenic science. Specifically, I argue that race, gender, class, and disability converge in the discourse of the degeneration, which, by contesting rigid standards of corporeal and cultural normalcy, represents the threat of difference posed by people with disabilities, poor people, and ethnic and racial minorities. I contend that as a rhetorical answer to the specter of degeneracy, a culture of biofuturity emerged in the U.S. in the late nineteenth century. I use the term “culture of biofuturity” to capture how literary and cultural production as well as social movements of the Progressive Era imagined a future in which improved social relations were inextricable from the improvement of the body through scientific eugenic reproduction practices that enabled “better breeding.” In “Degeneration Nation,” I read literary works by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Frances E.W. Harper, Pauline Hopkins, Charles Chestnutt, Edith Wharton, and Edith Summers Kelley in relation to contemporary socio-cultural projects of the period, such as the Panama Pacific International Exposition (PPIE), public health initiatives in San Francisco and Panama, post-Reconstruction black uplift movements, eugenic family studies such as Charles Davenport’s The Hill Folk , better baby and fitter family contests such as Mary Watts and Dr. Florence Sherbon’s “Fitter Family for Future Firesides,” and the birth control activism of Margaret Sanger. I also discuss medical writing by major medical figures of the period, such as S. Weir Mitchell, George M. Beard, and Miles Vandahurst Lynk. I read literature in conjunction with social and cultural texts in order to contextualize the literary works under study here as participants in complex social activities, as constituted by specific discursive practices and as outgrowths of a specific mode of production, as a means of better understanding the symbolic economies of the texts which govern their possibilities for meaning.",762395584,,Dissertations & Theses," Stuckey, Michelle AnnStuckeyAnnMichelleStuckey, Michelle Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2180212961 , 53332301 , 66569 , 9781124272375 , 3426445 , 3426445", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124272375, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/762395584?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature",," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature"," American studies , Womens studies , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , American literature , Critical medical studies , Cultural studies , Disability studies , Progressive Era , Women's studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Degeneration+nation%3A+The+body%2C+medicine%2C+and+the+culture+of+biofuturity+in+American+literature%2C+1883-1928&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stuckey%2C+Michelle+Ann&amp;isbn=9781124272375&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"372,Democracy and social movement learning in Ghana: Reflections on 15 years of learning in the democratic terrain by Ghanaian activist-educators,"Ghana’s democracy is a widely-known African good news story. What is not known about this story is how this democracy’s dynamism is fundamentally grounded on ongoing social movement activism that is constantly pressurizing the largely elite democratic institutions to better respond to the everyday needs of average Ghanaians. Critical to this pressurization is not only activism around domestic policies, but also a wide-spread ongoing questioning of the forces of transnational neoliberal governmentality that discipline, contain, and subvert the potential of African states to place the needs of their populace in-front of the needs of transnational capital. This is the alternative story of Ghana’s democracy told by this study, where Ghanaian activist-educators embedded in the country’s various contemporary social movements have come together in a participatory research endeavour to critically analyze Ghana’s current democratic terrain. Key to this analysis is the connection between Ghana’s social movement activism, and learning within these movements, to this reconstituted story of Ghana’s democracy. According to our participatory research group, it is the intersection of the ways movements learn and communicate with the ways these movements stay rooted in the needs of their wider membership that concomitantly determines their impact on the range of democratic possibility. Instrumental to this intersection, according to this study, are the informal processes through which movement members learn in, through, and to struggle. It is from our mutually-constituted understanding of these processes that our participatory research is now leading to action.",807679836,,Dissertations & Theses," Langdon, JonathanLangdonJonathanLangdon, Jonathan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2194705671 , 55704071 , 66569 , 9780494664490 , NR66449 , NR66449", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494664490, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/807679836?accountid=14496," 0516 Adult education , 0700 Social structure"," 0516 Adult education , 0700 Social structure"," 0516 Adult education , 0700 Social structure",," 0516 Adult education , 0700 Social structure"," Adult education , Social structure"," Education , Social sciences , Activism , Democracy , Ghana , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Democracy+and+social+movement+learning+in+Ghana%3A+Reflections+on+15+years+of+learning+in+the+democratic+terrain+by+Ghanaian+activist-educators&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Langdon%2C+Jonathan&amp;isbn=9780494664490&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"373,We Are Made of Our Food: Latino/a Immigration and the Practices and Politics of Eating,"This dissertation explores how claims of Latino/a immigrants to food justice and food entitlements are made, reshaped, and denied in Seattle, Washington. Drawing upon four years of ethnographic fieldwork from 2005 through 2009, I advance three central arguments. First, I argue that a transnational approach to cultural and social citizenship provides a useful framework for making connections between broad social and political-economic processes and the everyday lived experiences of Latino/a immigrants with respect to food. Secondly, I take up the question of the possibilities for urban agriculture in meeting the needs of Latino/a immigrants and argue that the movements for sustainable food in the Seattle area are far from achieving a truly transformative and just food system that serves the needs of all residents. Finally, I argue that while emergency food programs fill a crucial need for individuals and families who are excluded from federal and state food entitlement programs based on citizenship status, the emergency food system remains an imperfect and temporary fix to more fundamental issues of structural violence and marginalization. Methodologically, this study contributes to a genealogy of multi-scalar anthropological studies that use locally grounded ethnography to demystify the discourses, practices, and effects of social structures and institutions. I follow the extended case method method and draw upon feminist approaches to ethnography and participatory methodologies to create an ethnography grounded in and by the local community with applied and practical relevance. Theoretically, my dissertation brings together and contributes to four integrated bodies of scholarship: Marginality and Structural Violence, Transnational Immigration and Settlement, Latino/a Agency and Citizenship, and The Political Economy of Food Systems. Through highlighting examples of agency that I witnessed within multiple levels of the food system, I hope that this dissertation draws attention to manifestations of individual and collective resistance that have the potential to transform the current food system. At the same time, through exposing the ways that agency and resistance are constrained, I render visible the contradictions inherent to the market, state, and civil society as mechanisms of regulation and control that dramatically impact the lived experiences of Latino/a immigrants.",808257524,,Dissertations & Theses," Mares, Teresa MarieMaresMarieTeresaMares, Teresa Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2195651731 , 52072861 , 66569 , 9781124325613 , 3431682 , 3431682", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124325613, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/808257524?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Cultural anthropology , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Ethnography , Food security , Food studies , Hunger , Immigration , Latino/a",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+Are+Made+of+Our+Food%3A+Latino%2Fa+Immigration+and+the+Practices+and+Politics+of+Eating&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mares%2C+Teresa+Marie&amp;isbn=9781124325613&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"374,Teachers' resistance: Japanese teachers stories from the 1960s,"The purpose of this study is to listen to teachers’ stories and reconstruct their classrooms in the midst of the global upheaval of people’s movements in the 1960s-70s through teachers’ narratives. The primary research questions are: How did social movements in the 1960s-1970s influence their teaching practices? What was their intention and how did they carry out their daily teaching practice? In the educational research field, narrative inquirers explore teachers’ stories, their life experiences and teaching practices, in order to understand how teachers view the world. I collected stories, through in-depth interviews, of ten Japanese teachers who taught in Japanese public school system, and were active in social and educational movements during the 1960s-70s in order to understand how teachers understood and resisted dominant oppressive forces which create and perpetuate social inequality. Teacher narratives were analyzed using two complementary methods: contents analysis and interactional positioning theory. First, stories of teachers’ struggles in their classrooms and schools were contextualized in a wider social struggle for humanity and a more just society, in order to explore teachers’ understanding of social oppression and their resistance, and multiculturalism in Japanese classrooms in the 1960s-1970s. Through their stories, an indigenous multicultural nature of Japanese classrooms was revealed, even before the multiculturalism became an imported educational topic in the 1980s. Furthermore, using interactional positioning theory, I discussed how teacher activist identities were constructed during the narration, at the same time, uncover how social stigma of being an activist possibly suppressed the participants overtly constructing an activist identity in narratives.",814814962,,Dissertations & Theses," Kato, ReikoKatoReikoKato, Reiko",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2200826321 , 55868311 , 66569 , 9781124320021 , 3427543 , 3427543", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124320021, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/814814962?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0520 Education history , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0520 Education history , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0520 Education history , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0520 Education history , 0727 Curriculum development"," Educational sociology , Education history , Curriculum development , Teacher attitudes , Classrooms , Social change"," Education , Activist teacher , Multiculturalism , Teacher resistance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teachers%27+resistance%3A+Japanese+teachers+stories+from+the+1960s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kato%2C+Reiko&amp;isbn=9781124320021&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"375,Rhetorical interactions of social movement organizations in a movement: A study of the intersex rights advocacy movement,"While rhetorical scholars have long studied social movements, few studies investigate the rhetorical interactions of organizations working within a single movement.

Rather than merely selling lipsticks and perfumes, I argue that Avon's direct selling system is a geopolitical project that has - and continues to - capitalize on national differences by presenting Western beauty practices as key to modernity; ideal femininity as something achieved by consumption of beauty aids; and the work of an Avon Lady as a gateway to ""civilized"" society. To better isolate key moments in Avon's global expansion, each chapter examines specific discourses over the last fifty years that have helped produce and sustain Avon's far flung geographic reach and influence. Some examine these moments within the geographic and cultural/political/social context of the United States, while the others examine how they operated outside the United States, especially in Latin and South America. Together, they document the strategies Avon developed to harness the power of women's social networks to facilitate the global sale and appeal of its products. A critical examination of Avon's transnational history presents new ways to discuss the gendered dimensions of globalization and transnationalism; the emergence and global influence of U.S. and Western commercial beauty practices; the geopolitical dimensions of selling beauty; and the impact of popular social and political movements on corporate branding enterprises.",815403705,,Dissertations & Theses," Feitz, LindseyFeitzLindseyFeitz, Lindsey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2202883051 , 50473731 , 66569 , 9781124324296 , 3427764 , 3427764", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124324296, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/815403705?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0338 Marketing , 0453 Womens studies"," 0323 American studies , 0338 Marketing , 0453 Womens studies"," 0323 American studies , 0338 Marketing , 0453 Womens studies",," 0323 American studies , 0338 Marketing , 0453 Womens studies"," American studies , Marketing , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Avon , Beauty ambassadors , Cosmetics , Femininity , Gender , Globalization , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Democratizing+beauty%3A+Avon%27s+global+beauty+ambassadors+and+the+transnational+marketing+of+femininity%2C+1954%E2%80%932010&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feitz%2C+Lindsey&amp;isbn=9781124324296&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"377,"Restoring human dignity and building self-reliance: Youth, women, and churches and Black Consciousness community development, South Africa, 1969–1977","This dissertation explores the community development ideas and practices of South Africa's Black Consciousness movement, a leading anti-apartheid force in the late 1960s and 1970s. It focuses on the Black Community Programs (BCP) organization and three of its most important projects: the Zanempilo Community Health Center and the Njwaxa leather-work factory (both in the rural Eastern Cape), and the BCP's annual publication, Black Review. Based on South African archival sources and over seventy oral history interviews, it evaluates the BCP's social and economic impact and the key role of youth, women and churches in supporting and carrying out these projects. It argues that Black Consciousness activists took an innovative, participatory approach to development that combined their philosophy of black psychological liberation and self-reliance with the transnational ideas and methodology of Brazil's Paulo Freire. When putting their philosophy and methods into practice, activists faced state repression, tensions within local black communities, and contradictions emerged between their avowed self-reliance and their use of so-called white liberal resources. The study further concludes that although short-lived, Black Consciousness community work succeeded in improving the material conditions of individuals and communities and strengthening their sense of self-worth and self-reliance. This study speaks to the historiography on Black Consciousness and South African liberation movements. Previous scholarly literature has failed to address Black Consciousness community development adequately. Yet, it was an integral part of the movement from its beginning to 1977 (when all Black Consciousness organizations were shut down by the government). This study helps us understand more about the activists and their relationships with each other and the broader black community. It also adds to the history of rural South Africa while demonstrating the importance of oral history and grassroots activities and actors in the history of political and social movements. The first two chapters lay the background of community work and the Black Consciousness philosophy. Chapter 1 examines the place of community work in the philosophy and South African Student's Organization. Chapter 2 documents and analyzes the founding of the BCP as part of the Black Consciousness movement and the ecumenical, Christian organizations that sponsored it. The next three chapters are case studies. The Zanempilo clinic represents the health initiatives of the BCP and serves as an illustration of the Black Consciousness holistic approach to development. Chapter 4 analyzes how the BCP intended for their publications and resource centers to serve as development tools by publishing from a black perspective and contributing to an informal program of education. Chapter 5 compares the BCP effort to establish a home-industry in Njwaxa to other government and white business development efforts in the Ciskei.

'Ibis thesis explores this policy question through a case study of the evolution of the global intellectual property regime as it relates to pharmaceuticals (""the global IP regime"") from 1994-2009. Encapsulated in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the global IP regime of the 1990s required developing countries to grant stringent patent monopolies on medicines, however, the regime has since evolved to afford substantively greater policy space for developing countries to take into account public health needs. How did this regime change come about? Beginning around 1995, a small set of developing country governments, civil society organizations, and experts succeeded in de-stabilizing the legitimacy – and thereby the authority – of the IP regime by problematizing and beginning to re-frame IP rules as a social issue. This re-framing attracted new actors and resources, facilitating further re-framing and the shift of IP debates into new institutional arenas, such as the World Health Assembly. The movement for global access to AIDS treatment created a policy crisis from 1999-2001, which opened a window of opportunity for regime change; codified in the WTO Doha Declaration, the revised regime afforded greater priority to health concerns and allowed increased flexibility in IP rules. These new norms were consolidated in the ensuing years through a series of interconnected global and national-level political contests over national legislation, court cases, and policy decisions. By 2009, the IP regime had become at least partially embedded to take into greater account public health concerns reflected in changes in formal and informal rules, norms, and the discourse and practices of all the relevant actors. By using global networks to tap into a broad range of power resources (normative, structural, institutional, expert and economic), a loose coalition of developing country governments, CSOs and experts changed the global IP regime. The case demonstrates how relatively ""weak"" actors in the global system can marshal various sources of power to render global economic rules more equitable and inclusive.",815849690,,Dissertations & Theses," Moon, SuerieMoonSuerieMoon, Suerie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2204031371 , 55753391 , 66569 , 9781124338484 , 3435473 , 3435473", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124338484, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/815849690?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law"," 0573 Public health , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law"," 0573 Public health , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law",," 0573 Public health , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law"," Public health , International Relations , International law"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Access to medicines , Development , Embedded liberalism , HIV/AIDS , Intellectual property , TRIPS , Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Embedding+neoliberalism%3A+Global+health+and+the+evolution+of+the+global+intellectual+property+regime+%281995-2009%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moon%2C+Suerie&amp;isbn=9781124338484&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"379,"Engineering the global Indian: Skills, cosmopolitanism, and families in circuits of high-tech migrations between India and the United States","This dissertation focuses on Indian technomigration – the transnational movements of Indian engineers between India and the United States. It documents and analyzes the experiences and perceptions of Indian technomigrants and the structural conditions that shape their mobility. The research was oriented by two main questions: (1) How do Indian technomigrants understand their own mobility? What shapes these understandings? (2) What historical, cultural, and political-economic conditions shape Indian technomigration? What are the cultural and structural (trans)formations that it engenders? The research was designed as a multi-sited ethnography (Marcus 1995): ethnographic interviews with Indian technomigrants, participant-observation, and internet and noninternet based primary and secondary research constitute the main methods of datacollection. 30 in-depth interviews were conducted with Indian engineering students in Mumbai, India, Indian graduate engineering students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY, and Indian early-career professionals based in various parts of the United States as part of this research. Technomigrant writings, in the form of application essays to graduate school, and as essays reflecting on the practice of transnational mobility are also important data sources. Data from participant-observation at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2009 at Chennai, India – an annual diaspora conference organized by the Government of India – constitutes a third data-set. The dissertation argues that Indian technomigration is shaped by multiple factors at different scales - a historic overproduction of engineers by the Indian educational system, middle class imaginations of successful careers and lifestyles, logics of kinship, a perceived shortage of skilled labor in the United States and the global economy, and discourses of cosmopolitanism, being some of the most salient ones. These drivers of Indian technomigration articulate in complex ways. A key argument is that frustrations with the Indian state writ large have meant that Indian technomigrants have become carriers of economic liberalization, even while they are legacy beneficiaries of state socialism through systems such as subsidized higher education. U.S. immigration law, through its emphasis on attracting highly skilled labor, also draws and regulates the flow of Indian technomigrants into the United States. In doing so, it interpolates them into an intermediate position of a “model minority” within the preexisting racial hierarchy. Together, these conditions render Indian technomigrants particularly dependent on a moralizing discourse of “Global Indian” cosmopolitanism – a discourse that allows Indian technomigrants to simultaneously maintain a strong cultural-national Indian identity while also distancing themselves from the Indian state machinery, as well as carving a distinct, culturally isolated social space for themselves in the United States. In the process, the family, both as an ideological and a practical construct, becomes a strong locus of individualized investment, supporting a range of “privatized strategies” (Fernandes 2005) for success and security. Empirically and theoretically, the dissertation contributes to an understanding of how people move and invest in contexts characterized by economic liberalization. In Indian technomigrants, the dissertation thus describes an emergent community of practice that is articulating new ways of being and belonging in the emerging world order – a differential cosmopolitanism that is based in notions of difference of Indian culture from dominant Western culture. Methodologically, this dissertation furthers understanding of how (global) systems (Marcus &amp; Fischer 1986/1999) can be understood and portrayed through ethnographic research and writing. One methodological argument is that moral discourses (here that of cosmopolitanism and Global Indianness) are usefully conceived as infrastructural in nature, providing support not unlike the kind of support that law and technology provide. A second methodological argument is that many systems of concern to ethnographers are reflexive, morphing as players within the systems interpret and evaluate their context(s). Collier &amp; Ong’s (2005) conception of “global assemblages” is thus particularly useful because it highlights ways the reflectiveness of actors within a system animates the very system they reflect on. The notion of “global assemblages” thus usefully extends established ways of thinking about systems in Science and Technology Studies, which has been characterized by a limited emphasis on how acts of interpretation, especially in domains of relative privilege, alter the very systems in which they take place. Results of this dissertation will contribute to streams of scholarly research on transnationalism and global order, on the role of family and skill in economic liberalization, and on the subject constitution of technologically skilled emerging middle classes. Results can also advance insight on how race, privilege and bias continue to operate in the contemporary global system, informing practical efforts to build just and effective structures to support global circulations of people and expertise.",816601042,,Dissertations & Theses," Khandekar, AalokKhandekarAalokKhandekar, Aalok",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2208242831 , 56029211 , 66569 , 9781124350424 , 3435855 , 3435855", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124350424, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/816601042?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Asian Indian , Cosmopolitanism , Families , Global Indianness , Indian engineers , Skilled labor , Technomigration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Engineering+the+global+Indian%3A+Skills%2C+cosmopolitanism%2C+and+families+in+circuits+of+high-tech+migrations+between+India+and+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khandekar%2C+Aalok&amp;isbn=9781124350424&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=Conversations+with+Amiri+Baraka&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1994063426&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"380,"Borderless world, boundless threat: Online Jihadists and modern terrorism","The online jihadist community represents a new phenomenon in the global spread of Islamic radicalism. Many terrorism experts largely ignore the fact that the Internet is more than just a tool for established terrorist organizations--it can be a platform for the evolution of the jihadist social movement itself. While the majority of this movement's members are casual supporters of a global Islamist jihad against the West, a number of the community's members have already proven willing to take their virtual beliefs into the real world through terrorist acts. Many of these terrorists have attracted significant media attention--Jihad Jane, the Christmas Day Bomber, the Fort Hood Shooter, the attack on CIA agents in Afghanistan, the Times Square Bomber, and a number of other ""homegrown"" terrorists. The individuals perpetrating these terrorist acts are as diverse as they are dangerous, presenting a significant challenge to counterterrorism officials and policymakers. This study profiles 20 recent cases of online jihadists who have made the transition to real-world terrorism along a number of characteristics: age, ethnicity, immigration status, education, religious upbringing, socio-economic class, openness about beliefs, suicidal tendencies, rhetoric focus, location, target, terrorist action, offline and online activity, and social isolation or the presence of an identity crisis. The analysis shows that today, it is much less important how al-Qaida or any other jihadist group expresses its ideology, because any individual may self-radicalize and interpret the jihadist social movement in their own way and carry out terrorist attacks based on this understanding. When the jihadist social movement becomes borderless, the threat presented by the terrorists it inspires is no longer limited by the artificial boundaries of the real world. Counterterrorism officials must recognize this and adopt a long-term strategy for combating this movement.",818725727,,Dissertations & Theses," Hayne, Spencer O.HayneO.SpencerHayne, Spencer O.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2217682191 , 51226941 , 66569 , 9781124348605 , 1483143 , 1483143", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124348605, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/818725727?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," International Relations , Political science"," Social sciences , Counterterrorism , Internet , Islamist , Jihad , Online , Terrorism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Borderless+world%2C+boundless+threat%3A+Online+Jihadists+and+modern+terrorism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hayne%2C+Spencer+O.&amp;isbn=9781124348605&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"381,"“A time for resistance”: Globalization, undocumented immigration, and the Chicana/o movement in the San Diego borderlands","This dissertation asks how the ethnic Mexican community in Southern California struggled for full societal membership while a large proportion of their constituency were noncitizens and therefore targets of border enforcement policies? These violations, due to racialist presumptions of border enforcement, not only affected immigrants, but also U.S. citizens of Mexican heritage. I demonstrate that beginning in the 1920s and continuing to the present, with particular highlight on the “Chicano movement” of the 1960s and 70s, a number of activists responded to this conundrum by forging a conception of community across differences in nationality (American and Mexican) and citizenship status (U.S. citizens and Mexican immigrants). This more fluid, transnational conception of a “Chicano-Mexicano” community was chiefly developed through the spectrum of a shared ethnicity and culture coupled with the experience of racialization by border enforcement immigration policies. Transnational and cross-citizenship status solidarity within the ethnic Mexican community was forged in the context of struggle against more narrowly nationalistic forces both within and outside the community. In recognition of this vexing context, my dissertation explores the activism emanating from the Committee on Chicano Rights (CCR) led by Herman Baca, a printer from the barrios of southeast San Diego County. Building off the cross-citizenship activism of Mexican-American labor activists of the previous generation, the CCR utilized a grassroots approach to mobilizing by basing itself in and interacting with working-class Latina/o community members to assess key social problems and develop solutions to them. Mobilizing as a united ethno-racial community in classic Chicano movement style, the CCR moved into addressing class issues through engagement with the capital-labor antagonism embedded within immigration policy. This community-based effort engaged constituents initially through voter registration and later through providing community services to undocumented migrants, going door-to-door calling issues-based meetings in communal places such as the local church, and establishing an open presence out of Baca’s printing shop in the main commercial strip of the city. In this way, the CCR stayed attuned to the demographic transformations occurring in the Latina/o community in the 1970s, namely the mass influx of new migrant laborers, many of whom were undocumented.",821548521,,Dissertations & Theses," Patino, Jimmy C., Jr.PatinoC.JimmyJr.Patino, Jimmy C., Jr.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2224304241 , 51114721 , 66569 , 9781124368795 , 3432465 , 3432465", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124368795, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/821548521?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," American history , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , California , Chicana/o movement , Globalization , Immigration , Race and ethnicity , San Diego , U.S.-Mexico border",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CA+time+for+resistance%E2%80%9D%3A+Globalization%2C+undocumented+immigration%2C+and+the+Chicana%2Fo+movement+in+the+San+Diego+borderlands&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patino%2C+Jimmy+C.%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9781124368795&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"382,"Governing sexualities: Globalization, biopower, and citizenship in postcolonial India","This dissertation compares the political struggles around decriminalization of homosexuality and sex work in contemporary India. Since the mid-1990s the Indian state and national and international NGOs have been mobilizing sex workers and gay populations for HIV/AIDS prevention work in India. I asks two primary questions: First, how do the legal and political challenges around sex work and homosexuality become articulated in the face of local needs and practices and transnational concern about HIV/AIDS; and second, what do these challenges reveal about state power over how human bodies are used in a postcolonial context and about the connections between sexuality and modernity. I draw on Foucault's concept of biopower—the surveillance, control, and management of populations—to analyze what happens as these groups become part of transnational health projects for the first time, and how these projects transform the relationship between the state and sexually marginalized communities into one in which they have more opportunity to assert themselves as rights-bearing actors. I also show how state agencies find themselves competing among themselves in their relationships to these groups. The Indian state both needs to work with these groups to prevent HIV/AIDS but also to impose the criminal sanctions on homosexuality and sex work mandated by law. I pay particular attention to these disjunctures within the state, and analyze how they do or do not enable these groups to resist stigma and discrimination and demand formal legal rights from the Indian state. Despite the engagement of transnational actors and local social movements, I find that the demands for inclusion of marginalized communities are not always external to the state. Transnational groups, the state and the movements are co-constituting the politics of rights on the ground.",821684368,,Dissertations & Theses," Lakkimsetti, ChaitanyaLakkimsettiChaitanyaLakkimsetti, Chaitanya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2219600271 , 54741861 , 66569 , 9781124363882 , 3437047 , 3437047", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124363882, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/821684368?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , GLBT Studies , South Asian Studies , Social structure , Comparative analysis , Globalization , Citizenship , Colonialism , Politics , Homosexuality , Prostitution , Human immunodeficiency virus--HIV , Acquired immune deficiency syndrome--AIDS , Nongovernmental organizations--NGOs , Sexuality , India"," Social sciences , Biopower , Globalization , Homosexuality , India , Postcolonial , Sex work , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Governing+sexualities%3A+Globalization%2C+biopower%2C+and+citizenship+in+postcolonial+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lakkimsetti%2C+Chaitanya&amp;isbn=9781124363882&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"383,Watching the world watch: News media and the everyday politics of international oversight in post-conflict Macedonia,"This dissertation is an ethnography of the Macedonian public sphere. It analyzes contemporary forms of international intervention associated with transnational “global governance” and European integration. Following the 2001 armed conflict in Macedonia, diplomats and officials from the European Union and United States saturated the Macedonian public sphere with value-laden evaluations of the country's political maturity and prescriptive expectations for its future. I show how the public speech of foreign officials in Macedonia depended on and enacted a different set of communicative norms, language ideologies, and metadiscursive regimentations when compared to the standards that mediated and shaped participation in Macedonia's national public. I then demonstrate how the gap between foreigner and Macedonian “regimes of publicity” animated new political and social engagements in Macedonia as political actors and ordinary citizens would refigure the discursive forms locally associated with “Europe” in pursuit of recognition and authority before contrasting international and domestic audiences. The dissertation details this recognition politics through ethnographic descriptions of: news media production, a grassroots protest movement, politicians' performances, and everyday genres of sociality and self-presentation. Ultimately, the dissertation contends that international actors' achievement of an “oversight public” in Macedonia, and Macedonian practices that presupposed international oversight, constituted a central dimension to the remaking of Macedonia's post-conflict and post-socialist social order. By tying Macedonian ways of being and acting in public together with this particular rendering of post-conflict democracy-building, the dissertation amounts an ethnographic account of a new political subject who is dually interpellated by local social relations and the presumed gaze of foreigners. I illustrate how the double consciousness of Macedonian forms of publicity catalyzed an internationally sanctioned, neoliberal redistribution of rights and responsibility at the expense of pre-existing models of social entitlement. My attention to foreigner and Macedonian modes of publicity, and the tensions between them, provides a novel analytic and theoretical window on political communication and its relation to political structure, governmentality and political subjectivity. The dissertation adds a critical, ethnographic perspective to the study of global governance and European Union enlargement by a focus on communicative aspects of the cultural politics intrinsic to any transnational political exercise.",822630554,,Dissertations & Theses," Graan, AndrewGraanAndrewGraan, Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2230992191 , 51510381 , 66569 , 9781124376639 , 3432720 , 3432720", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124376639, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822630554?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Journalism , East European Studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , European integration , International intervention , Macedonia , News media , Political communication , Publicity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Watching+the+world+watch%3A+News+media+and+the+everyday+politics+of+international+oversight+in+post-conflict+Macedonia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Graan%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781124376639&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"384,Through the Lens of a Global Educator: Examining Personal Perceptions Regarding the Construction of World-Mindedness,"As we embark upon the 21st century, the world is becoming increasingly interconnected. Yet, despite increasing globalization, educational systems are not reflecting this phenomenon. The overwhelming majority of countries, including the United States, still emphasize nationalistic curricula (Parker, 2008; Tye, 2009). Global education is a movement whose supporters advocate an education reflecting the push towards globalization by providing students with the components necessary to live and thrive in an increasingly interconnected world system. Global educators have a common bond as advocates that a global perspective needs to be developed in the classroom. The degree to which this is being done is unknown. Further, how a global educator is prepared and formed is unknown. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research in global education (Gaudelli, 2003). Personal experiences have a major influence to what a teacher attributes his or her beliefs and values (Lincoln, 2005), and this is an area of study that has not been examined in global education. Using a mixed-methods design that includes a background survey, a global-mindedness survey and interviews would provide a better understanding of what self-identifying global educators attribute their global-mindedness. By presenting a rich account of the perspectives of high school social studies teachers who are involved with a global education initiative, social studies teacher education programs can gain insight about providing the best preparation that will lead to teacher candidates gaining the skills necessary to teach from a global perspective. The case study presented here consisted of 2 surveys, multiple interviews, and examination of program documents. Analysis resulted in 8 themes identified by the participants as being attributed to the development of a global perspective: (a) family, (b) exposure to diversity, (c) minority status, (d) curious disposition, (e) global education courses, (f) international travel, (g) having a mentor, and (h) professional service. Additionally, the themes were perceived to influence curricular decision making by providing strategies, resources, and empathy towards students. The participants' perspectives have implications on social studies teacher education programs and future research. These implications include the types of instructional methods, themes, and global dimensions that should be addressed in teacher education programs.

Features incised into and structures built onto the natural environment by the first arriving colonists after the mid-seventeenth century endured for more than two centuries. Over that period, the humanly-created material environment, a social product, fed back into the development of social forms--institutions, rituals, practices, modes of interaction, activities, and beliefs. A significant number of these social forms endured into the late nineteenth century and beyond, even after mechanization and industrialization arrived in the region known as The Pass, the area currently occupied by the two cities. The analysis of the status of buildings as signifying systems on the border reveals shifts in border interdependency not often evident in written records. This work shows large architectural features to be contingent rather than autonomous and self-fulfilling, as enmeshed in circumstance, connected to power and institutional authorities. The constructed architectural object is understood as ""text"" that signifies and transmits socio-cultural meanings, but in a manner that is specific to architecture, whether produced through specialized aesthetic judgments or by shared cultural processes. During the nineteenth century large scale shifts in political arrangements intensified the importance of the former supply station on Spain's northern frontier. Mexico's independence from Spain, 1810-1821, and loss of territory through aggressive acquisition by the United States, 1846-1848, created an international border setting. After 1880 arrival of the railroads propelled the two towns into rapid urbanization and modernization. The built environment of the two towns empowered municipal development, political, social, economic, and cultural. The first international railroad and street railway bridges furthered local and state relations and expanded bi-national trade and commerce in unprecedented ways. Their forms, based on developing trestle technology, added new dimensions to the physical infrastructure of the border towns and created trans-border investment and entrepreneurial partnerships. An attempt to exploit bridges as social agents shows the power of the built environment in its own right. From 1885-1905 mercantilist architecture reflected Mexico's newly-reduced tariff rates and intentions to equalize economic opportunity in the borderlands. Many of the new-style department stores in Ciudad Juárez, funded and constructed by Europeans, communicated a global entrepreneurship active on this commercial frontier. Perceived as a challenge by El Paso's merchants, the buildings embodied a surge of investment on the Mexican side which engendered a period of fierce and bitter competition within the dual community. Research into El Paso's built environment of the period shows clearly that the town's overheated resistance to commercial success in its sister city was unwarranted and unwise. Mercantile emporiums and stores, warehouses, and railroad depots reified Mexico's experiment with tariff reductions and spawned a bi-national consumer pool. Specific sets of objects shared the work--social, political, cultural, and economic--that projected the particular character of the built environment of the El Paso-Ciudad Juárez bi-national community. Groups of structures, acting as social agents, provided a means of interaction rather like language, but additional to it. Government halls and customshouses across the combined cityscape depicted and encouraged nationalistic fervor and zealous patriotism. I argue that social forms, for example, sodalities or congregations, are not only contingent on human activities but also depend on the material environment of those activities. Cultural institutions fit the pattern of objects that, once built, subsequently shape their human creators. Schools, libraries, hospitals, and churches projected powerful visual messages of economic development and cultural ambitions shared by the two towns. In part, the structural forms helped to shape local societies. Moreover, the edifices, many massive and imposing compared to preceding architecture, gave notice to the outside world of modernizing achievements on the fringes of both nations. The sphere of transportation was especially formative at The Pass. Geographic location invited the physical reality of iron rails and steam engines which spanned the international border, cut through the hearts of both towns, and launched the region into its role as a hub for intersecting railroad companies. Architecturally speaking, railroads redesigned both towns by their preemption of local space, but also by reducing time and space for exchange of goods and movement of people, and by carrying wire connections for vastly-facilitated communication. Later airports served many of the same functions, further compressing time and space, stamping their imprint into the earth as had those first intrepid settlers. This dissertation is intended as an introduction to the use of material culture as an analytic tool for further exploration into the social, cultural, political, and economic worlds in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.",837428757,,Dissertations & Theses," Hodges, Gladys ArleneHodgesArleneGladysHodges, Gladys Arlene",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2236210571 , 53267171 , 66569 , 9781124396781 , 3433699 , 3433699", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124396781, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/837428757?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0729 Architecture"," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0729 Architecture"," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0729 Architecture",," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0729 Architecture"," American history , International Relations , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Borderlands theory , Material culture , Texas , Urban history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=El+Paso%2C+Texas%2C+and+Ciudad+Ju%C3%A1rez%2C+Chihuahua%2C+1880-1930%3A%0AA+material+culture+study+of+borderlands+interdependency&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hodges%2C+Gladys+Arlene&amp;isbn=9781124396781&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"386,"Making Africans and Indians: Colonialism, Identity, Racialization, and the Rise of the Nation-State in the Florida Borderlands, 1765-1837","The Florida Borderlands from 1765 to 1837 was a fluid space in which established colonial and Indigenous social, political, and economic systems were in dialogue with emerging discourses associated with the market economy, nationalism, and race. Utilizing British, Spanish, and United States government documents, diplomatic correspondence, and slave claims, this work traces the racialization of diverse Indigenous and African populations. Older colonial powers and nascent nation states sought to create political and social space between individuals within these categories in an effort to better control their labor, movement, and economic status. Consequently, Seminoles and Africans resisted and adapted, depending on the situation, to these new forms of colonialism, especially during the U.S-Seminole Wars. This study's chronological scope facilitates a greater focus on the continuity of processes such as racialization and identity formation between the British, second Spanish Florida, and U.S. territorial eras, roughly from the 1760s to the 1830s. Historians tend to compartmentalize these respective colonial projects as they pertain to Indigenous and African peoples. Additionally, runaway African slaves are viewed as simply members of the African Diaspora and separate from their Seminole neighbors despite their multifaceted relationship. This reinforces racial categories and de-emphasizes the fluid sociocultural boundaries that these groups crossed. A transnational borderlands framework interweaves the history of these groups and reveals their impact and influence upon each other. Since Florida was located within the larger Southeastern Borderlands and Atlantic World, it was affected by early nationalist discourse, the burgeoning international market economy, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.",837428823,,Dissertations & Theses," Nuno, John Paul A.NunoPaul A.JohnNuno, John Paul A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2236210561 , 53267171 , 66569 , 9781124397078 , 3433712 , 3433712", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124397078, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/837428823?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Black Seminoles , Borderlands , Florida , Racialization , Seminoles , Spanish Florida",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+Africans+and+Indians%3A+Colonialism%2C+Identity%2C+Racialization%2C+and+the+Rise+of+the+Nation-State+in+the+Florida+Borderlands%2C+1765-1837&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nuno%2C+John+Paul+A.&amp;isbn=9781124397078&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"387,An analysis of the ongoing Church Planting Movement among Western and Eastern Cuban Baptist Conventions from 1990–2008,"In the face of very difficult political, social, and economic circumstances, Cuba is experiencing an unprecedented movement of God, which has seen hundreds of thousands come to faith in Jesus Christ, along with thousands of new church starts. The purpose of this research is to analyze critically the Church Planting Movement taking place among the Eastern and Western Cuban Baptist Conventions from 1990-2008. Chapter 1 introduces the Church Planting Movement phenomenon. It includes a definition of the movement, an analysis of the ten universal elements, common factors, and the global impact. Chapter 2 describes and critically evaluates the antecedents to the present Church Planting Movement, including the religious background in Cuba, the beginnings and development of permanent Protestant work, the beginning and development of Baptist work, and the effects of the Communist Revolution on Church growth. An analysis of the indigenous heritage of Cuban Baptists and factors that contributed to the early growth of the work closes the chapter. Chapter 3 presents a critical review of the emergence and analysis of the growth of the Church Planting Movement among Baptists from 1990 to 2008. Additionally, a brief look at the Assemblies of God growth is included. Chapter 4 provides the findings and recommendations for the future of the Church Cuban Church Planting Movement. This chapter includes a critical analysis of the various models of Church that have emerged within the Church Planting Movement. Some of the obstacles that need to be overcome and the challenges to be faced for the Church Planting Movement to continue and even flourish are discussed as well. The final chapter offers a brief conclusion to the study of the Cuban Church Planting Movement, possible topics that warrant further study, and how this dissertation can be used to help encourage and foment Church Planting Movements in other traditional church contexts.",843217090,,Dissertations & Theses," Urbanek, Kurt VanUrbanekVanKurtUrbanek, Kurt Van",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2241382041 , 57297521 , 66569 , 9781124415703 , 3438478 , 3438478", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124415703, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/843217090?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," Religious history , Caribbean Studies , Baptist churches , Conventions , Social change , Social impact , Cuba"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Baptist , Church Planting Movement , Cuban Baptist Convention",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+the+ongoing+Church+Planting+Movement+among+Western+and+Eastern+Cuban+Baptist+Conventions+from+1990%E2%80%932008&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Urbanek%2C+Kurt+Van&amp;isbn=9781124415703&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"388,"The Commandment of Love: Liberal Christianity and Global Activism in the Young Women's Christian Association of the USA and the Maryknoll Sisters, 1907-80","Twentieth-century American women's religious activism did not end with the temperance movement. Nor was it limited to conservative Christianity. ""The Commandment of Love"" investigates the overlooked links between turn-of-the-century Christian women's reform culture and liberal social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Case studies of two influential organizations, the Protestant Young Women's Christian Association of the USA (YWCA) and the Catholic Maryknoll Sisters, reveal an evolving body of religious ideals that were put to service in the pursuit of social change. With an understanding that the biblical injunction to love one's neighbor gave women responsibility to shape life on earth, the groups mobilized around questions of labor, international relations, and race in a decades-long quest for fellowship and world unity. The dissertation argues that despite the perceived divide between Protestantism and Catholicism, an ethics of Christian love and dedication to single-sex community gave rise to a non-sectarian women's activism with global horizons. The organizations steadily grew more liberal and politicized, moving from an imperial evangelicalism to an interest in social justice and community empowerment. The YWCA established a breadth of programming that took a wide view of the Christian development of women. It immersed itself in reform early in its history, becoming an innovator in the labor and civil rights movements. The Maryknoll Sisters, a missionary religious order, gained new visibility for women's labor in the Catholic Church, particularly in the embrace of Cold War anti-communism. The sisters emerged from the upheavals of the 1960s as an emblem of left-wing Catholicism. At times, both groups earned acclaim for what was perceived to be selfless Christian service. At others, they came under profound censure. Following international women's activism from the imperialistic drive of early foreign mission to the late twentieth-century pursuit of human rights, this project challenges templates of social action that privilege the secular. In a departure from recent scholarship on the rise of conservative Christian politics, it underscores the persistent significance of religion as a wellspring of liberal activism. Finally, in examining the multifaceted strategies for progressive change that came out of single-sex organizing, it documents women's rich contributions to liberal religious thought and political movements.",847395596,,Dissertations & Theses," Izzo, Amanda LeeIzzoLeeAmandaIzzo, Amanda Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2249221351 , 53454691 , 66569 , 9781124422220 , 3440529 , 3440529", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124422220, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/847395596?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," Religious history , American history , Womens studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American Christianity , Feminism , Mary Knoll Sisters , Transnationalism , Young Womens Christian Association",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Commandment+of+Love%3A+Liberal+Christianity+and+Global+Activism+in+the+Young+Women%27s+Christian+Association+of+the+USA+and+the+Maryknoll+Sisters%2C+1907-80&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Izzo%2C+Amanda+Lee&amp;isbn=9781124422220&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"389,"Liberal Imperialism: The Rise and Fall of Liberal Internationalism in U.S.-China Relations and the Origins of the Cold War, 1898-1945","This dissertation is a study of the rise and fall of liberal internationalism in U.S.China relations from the late-nineteenth century until the end of WWII. I argue that framing the history of U.S.-China relations in this way illustrates the centrality of both the early-twentieth century and China to the origins of the global Cold War, and shows that the degree to which the U.S. conformed to, or veered away from, the ideals of liberal internationalism aid us in our understanding of the dynamics of U.S. imperialism during the twentieth century. The project traces a genealogy of the Cold War back to the late-nineteenth century, and locates its antecedents in new and interesting places and historical formations. This dissertation sheds light on critical aspects of the transnational history of the twentieth-century, and highlights the historical inseparability of race, empire, social and political movements, and international relations. Chapter 2 examines the transformation of Chinese conceptions of time and history in the late-nineteenth century from a cyclical mode to a linear one, and argues that this was critical for the emergence of China into a modern system of nation states. Chapter 3 argues that the American missionary enterprise in China was both imperialist and liberatory; by introducing Western liberal ideas into China, it ultimately sowed the seeds of its own undoing Chapter 4 maps the origins and rise of Chinese anti-communism, and chapter 5 illustrates how U.S. attempts to bring the CCP and KMT together were doomed because of the dynamics of Chiang Kai-shek's fanatical anti-communism. It also suggests that the wartime U.S. intelligence organization, SACO, provided the model for U.S.-supported Third World anti-communist insurgencies during the Cold War. Chapter 6 examines the international debates over the repeal of Chinese exclusion in the U.S., and suggests that exploring the dynamic political scene in China during that time as part of the repeal debate enlarges its traditional role beyond that of a minor episode in Asian American history. The final chapter examines the failure of U.S.-China diplomacy during the late-war years, and argues that it paved the way for McCarthyism.",849302791,,Dissertations & Theses," Chang, Jason C.ChangC.JasonChang, Jason C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2258098831 , 52127401 , 66569 , 9781124438276 , 3441150 , 3441150", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124438276, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/849302791?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," American studies , American history , Asian American Studies , International Relations"," Social sciences , Asian American , China , Cold War , Global Cold War , Imperialism , Liberal internationalism , Transnationalism , United States-China",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Liberal+Imperialism%3A+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Liberal+Internationalism+in+U.S.-China+Relations+and+the+Origins+of+the+Cold+War%2C+1898-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chang%2C+Jason+C.&amp;isbn=9781124438276&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"390,Cosmopolitan priming for change: Transnational social movements in Communist Eastern Europe,"Social movement scholars have argued that social movement mobilization at the micro level is a sequential multi-stage process but have ignored the first stage of this process, the creation of a pool of supporters from which movements can potentially draw participants, when analyzing the Eastern European protest wave of 1989. I question the assumption that such a pool of potential participants was ready-made and ask how it was formed. To address these concerns, I analyze the mobilization context in which the successful protest wave of 1989 developed. I contrast it with the mobilization contexts of the unsuccessful Chinese and Albanian cases. My concrete research question is: What were the societal institutional environment and the political culture in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s within which protest movements could gather mass support and within which democracy could take root? I argue that the Eastern European democratic impetus was grounded within a cosmopolitan world culture. I also argue that Eastern European transnational social movements were major cosmopolitan actors in creating and promoting this culture over more than a decade. Thus, cosmopolitanism served as a mobilization potential while the development of cosmopolitanism appears to have been the first stage of the protest mobilization process and subsequent democratization in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s. My evidence comes from various sources, including a dataset on transnational social movement organizations around the world from 1953 to 2003, the World Value Survey, data on movement membership and reach, and semi-structured interviews with members of the most prominent movement in the region, the Esperanto movement, in four Eastern European countries.",851112127,,Dissertations & Theses," Velitchkova, AnaVelitchkovaAnaVelitchkova, Ana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2262965931 , 58142621 , 66569 , 9781124463391 , 1489902 , 1489902", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124463391, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/851112127?accountid=14496," 0437 East European Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0437 East European Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0437 East European Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0437 East European Studies , 0700 Social structure"," East European Studies , Social structure", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cosmopolitan+priming+for+change%3A+Transnational+social+movements+in+Communist+Eastern+Europe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Velitchkova%2C+Ana&amp;isbn=9781124463391&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"391,Transnational Migration and the Reverse Mission of Nigerian-led Pentecostal Churches in the U.S.A.: A Case Study of Selected Churches in Metro Atlanta,"This research investigates the history, the transnational links, and mission of three Nigerian-led Pentecostal Churches in metropolitan Atlanta in order to discover, describe and analyze the relationship between such global flows and the stated goal of self professed ""reverse mission"" in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States of America. Three Nigerian Indigenous Pentecostal denominations were purposively selected for this study. The three denominations are the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), The Gospel Faith Mission International (GOFAMINT) and The Mountain of Fire and Miracles (MFM). The sample size for this study consisted of three denominations out of which nine churches were selected in Atlanta, and the international headquarters of the three selected denominations in Lagos, Nigeria and the U.S national office of the three denominations. The data for this research was gathered through five months of ethnographic field research in Lagos, Nigeria, and Atlanta, Georgia. The research involves interviews conducted with eighty selected church leaders and members who are engaged in transnational religious practices between Lagos Nigeria and Atlanta, U.S.A. Three theories guided this research work: Social network perspectives, Migration systems theory, and Social movement framing. This study was able to identify the following emerging themes/patterns. First, the history and patterns in the emergence of these churches reveals that they are started through house fellowships or through evangelistic crusades by mostly by members who migrate to the U.S. A. as students, businessmen and professionals. The study established that there are formal and informal transnational ties and channels of communication. The internet is used by these churches as a tool for transnational communication and networking. The study also found out that there are frequent flow of persons, products, ideas, and money flow between the founding churches in Lagos and the branches in Atlanta, with frequency of flow originating from Nigeria. The flow of persons is mostly at the upper and middle level management of these churches. Furthermore, this research found out these churches are presently in mission to mostly Nigerian/African communities in Atlanta, although they express strong interest in reaching out to other groups beyond the Nigerian community, and are indeed making efforts in this regard.

Cuban cigar makers exemplified the highly autonomous work culture of skilled artisans and their newspapers and workplace orators, or, lectors , articulated an eclectic internationalist anarchist ideology. Despite this internationalist orientation, creole cigar makers affiliated with the nineteenth century Cuban separatist movement were occasionally prone to anti-Spanish sentiments and ethnic chauvinism. Why did anarchist workers support a struggle for national liberation? In addition to analyzing the activities of Cuban cigar makers and their organizations on the island, the experiences of Cuban émigrés in Florida and New York City are a key element of the narrative. Whether they left Cuba due to economic or political factors, the cigar makers brought their ideas regarding workplace organization and labor action with them to the United States. Upon arrival, they were able to largely recreate the lives they had left behind with some important exceptions. In short, Cuban cigar makers lived transnational lives. They were connected socially, politically and economically to Cuba while at the same time actively engaged with the unique problems and concerns they found themselves facing in the United States. Employing a transnational framework of analysis challenges older narratives about labor and the working class and facilitates a revision of previous national-centered labor histories. The approach also allows for a more complex and fluid understanding of the transmission of anarchist ideology in the Atlantic region and the Caribbean. The result is a retelling of Cuban and United States labor history. Utilizing materials from archives in Cuba and the United States including organizational records, newspapers, and government intelligence, I seek to elucidate the relations between Cuban cigar makers, their organizations and the struggle for independence from Spanish rule. Anarchists did not frame the war against Spain as a strictly nationalist struggle. Instead they promoted the war as a legitimate struggle against imperialism that would pave the way for a broader, global, social revolution.",857921584,,Dissertations & Theses," Daniel, Evan MatthewDanielMatthewEvanDaniel, Evan Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2297723091 , 59441491 , 66569 , 9781124513195 , 3444203 , 3444203", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124513195, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/857921584?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," Latin American history , American history , Caribbean Studies"," Social sciences , Anarchism , Cigar makers , Cuba , Immigration , Labor , Radicalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rolling+for+the+revolution%3A+A+transnational+history+of+Cuban+cigar+makers+in+Havana%2C+Florida%2C+and+New+York+City%2C+1853-1895&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Daniel%2C+Evan+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781124513195&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"393,Influences of news reporting on global justice social movement organizations: A case study of Mobilization for Global Justice,"This project examined three protests organized by activists in the global justice movement against international financial institutions over an eight-year period. The first protest was a large-scale action against the World Trade Organization at the Third Ministerial in Seattle, WA, in November-December 1999. The other two protests included ""A16"" and the October Rebellion held in Washington, DC, in April 2000 and October 2007, respectively, protesting policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Analysis of mainstream and alternative broadcast and print news sources was conducted to understand the nature and characteristics of news reporting on protest. A wide variety of texts produced by activists was analyzed to ascertain the master frame of the global justice movement and the collective action frames of selected social movement organizations. These analyses, along with interviews with a group of activists, yielded insights into the influences of mainstream news reporting on individual activists and on the global justice movement. A ""protest paradigm"" in news reporting employs patterns of language, media frames, and description that tends to marginalize activists and discredit their efforts. Mainstream news coverage of Mobilization for Global Justice has dropped off precipitously since A16. Since one of the goals of these protests is to bring the policies of the international financial institutions to the general public's attention, lack of coverage marginalizes activists' efforts even further. Examination of the collective action frame of Mobilization for Global Justice, an organization formed shortly after the Third Ministerial, revealed evidence of frame adjustments to counter criticisms raised in the news media about the global justice movement. The two primary criticisms of the movement were a lack of diversity among the global justice activists and a rift among, activists over protest tactics. Activists interviewed for this project reported individual and collective identity conflicts resulting from media coverage. The finding that activists are largely either marginalized or ignored by mainstream news media suggests future avenues of research into the value and efficacy of protest as a form of political communication.

Drawing on empirical field research conducted in Vietnam, I consider how gender and development experts move gender-mainstreaming policies beyond national development planning and rhetoric to affect local, cultural change. I find that it is in the context of training, where experts struggle to give meaning to their work that different visions of gender equality emerge. As experts mobilize local knowledge about gender and development, they translate and transform everyday experiences of oppression in ways that simultaneously (re)produce and extend the development agenda. As a result, gender mainstreaming has become embedded in four competing political projects, each vying to control the framing of gender equality debates in Vietnam. I call these projects economic integrationist, transnational feminist, national independence, and cultural preservationist . They occur at interconnected levels of social scale: global, transnational, national, and household. I find that it is particularly in the context of training that these projects collide, and where inequalities corresponding to the four policy-linked levels of social scale are made visible. Understanding when and how these collisions occur, and how they are managed, given meaning, and resolved, illuminates competing visions of gender, equality and development. Throughout this work, I argue that current models for explaining the movement of equality discourses and practices from one policy context to the next fail to account for power struggles and complex responses that occur at the interstices of social scale. I present an alternative framework—what I call the political project policy wheel —linking projects to multiple, simultaneously occurring opportunity frames and to the personal commitments and intentions of individual actors. The political project policy wheel highlights the dynamic interconnectedness of the projects as concurrently local and translocal, and embedded in related but different assumptions about gender, generation and class. By conceptualizing training as sites of actors' struggles and engagement, my research illuminates notions of ""the global"" and ""the local"" as co-produced, and advances theories of social change.",860988836,,Dissertations & Theses," Kelly, KristyKellyKristyKelly, Kristy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2314708021 , 60101561 , 66569 , 9781124548845 , 3448869 , 3448869", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124548845, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/860988836?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0458 Education Policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0458 Education Policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0458 Education Policy , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0458 Education Policy , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , Education Policy , Social structure , Equity , Professional development , Gender , Vietnam"," Education , Social sciences , Feminist theory , Gender equality , Social change , Vietnam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learning+to+mainstream+gender+in+Vietnam%3A++Where+%E2%80%98equity%E2%80%99+meets+%E2%80%98locality%E2%80%99+in+development+policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kelly%2C+Kristy&amp;isbn=9781124548845&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"395,Aging in conflict environments: A case study of the occupied Palestinian territories,"The aging experience in conflict environments is influenced by numerous factors, including the social and physical environments, as well as behavioral and biological aspects of that experience. I utilize an ecological model of aging which employs four domains (social and physical environment, biology and behavior) to investigate mental and physical health outcomes among elders living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). The OPT has experienced long-term conflict, extending over 60 years, which has created an environment characterized by poor living conditions, physical and monetary barriers to health resources, and mobility restrictions that limit access to family and kin networks, as well as economic opportunities. The data used in this study were collected in 2006 and 2007 and comes from the Palestinian Family Health Survey, conducted as part of the League of Arab States Pan Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM). There were 1,645 participant responses regarding health status, food consumption, living environment, refugee status, social relations and health behaviors, from both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Logistic regression was used to construct adjusted odds ratios for factors hypothesized to influence health outcomes, as well as assess which of the four domains have more predictive power for poor mental and physical health. The social environment was the strongest predictive domain for poor mental health, whereas the physical environment had the strongest predictive ability for poor physical health. Additionally, independent risk factors for poor mental and physical health were identified using stepwise multivariate logistic regression. Among the 14 risk factors identified, 11 are modifiable by altering existing socio-political policies that contribute to poor civilian health in one of four ways: restrictions on civilian movement; limited economic and employment opportunities; poor environmental conditions; and border closures. While subtle differences did exist, overall refugee health and non-refugee health are relatively similar after controlling for marital status, sex, wealth, and education. The long term public health outcomes as a consequence of war and conflict are examined under the lens of international political economy.

The crusade movement concurrently formed dynamic international networks and disturbed geographic, cultural, religious and social boundaries in both the East and West. Because the most immediate zone for cultural and artistic exchange during the Crusades was the Holy Land, it has been the subject of immense amounts of historical and art historical scholarship examining issues of cultural and visual appropriation, assimilation and even resistance. However, the remapping of Christian territory after the First Crusade (1095-99), the establishment of transnational corporations (i.e., the military orders) and the reinvigoration of travel between East and West had an equally profound, yet surprisingly unexplored, impact on the visual culture and religious imagination of western Europe. Analyzing diverse visual material, from images of the military orders on seals, and monastic maps of Palestine in manuscripts, to royal chambers with paintings of holy warfare and the display of Holy Land relics at court, my project juxtaposes sacred and secular commissions made for crusaders and affiliates of chivalric culture. It also analyzes art for those, like monks, who would never physically experience Jerusalem. My study considers the role of crusade in the construction of personal and institutional identity in England, proposing, for instance, that the English kings were increasingly compelled to fashion themselves in the idealized image of the rex crucesignatus , crusader king. It carefully tracks the evolving vision of the Holy Land in England as destination, image, spectacle, or goal adapted and domesticated for English patrons and audiences over the longue durée . Finally it shows there was a concerted effort in England to localize the crusade movement and make it an explicitly English phenomenon, and to domesticate the Holy Land, especially Jerusalem, through art and architecture, ritual and display.",868856983,,Dissertations & Theses," Whatley, Laura JulindaWhatleyJulindaLauraWhatley, Laura Julinda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2359557851 , 61759721 , 66569 , 9781124641980 , 3455792 , 3455792", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124641980, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/868856983?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0581 Medieval history"," 0377 Art history , 0581 Medieval history"," 0377 Art history , 0581 Medieval history",," 0377 Art history , 0581 Medieval history"," Art history , Medieval history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Crusades , Holy Land , Jerusalem",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Localizing+the+Holy+Land%3A+The+visual+culture+of+crusade+in+England%2C+circa+1140-1307&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Whatley%2C+Laura+Julinda&amp;isbn=9781124641980&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"397,“&lt;i&gt;Gireogi gajok&lt;/i&gt;”: Transnationalism and language learning,"This dissertation examines effects of globalization on language, identity, and education through the case of four Korean jogi yuhak (early study abroad) students attending Toronto high schools. Resulting from a 2.4-year sociolinguistic ethnography on the language learning experiences of these students, the thesis explores how globalization–and the commodification of language and corporatization of education in the new economy, in particular–has transformed ideas of language, bilingualism, and language learning with respect to the transnational circulation of linguistic and symbolic resources in today's world. This thesis incorporates insights from critical social theories, linguistic anthropology, globalization studies, and sociolinguistics, and aims to propose a “globalization sensitive” Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory. To better grasp the ways in which language learning is socially and politically embedded in new conditions generated by globalization, this new SLA theory conceives of language as a set of resources and bilingualism as a social construct, and examines language learning as an economic activity, shaped through encounters with the transnational language education industry. The analysis examines new transnational subjectivities of yuhaksaeng (visa students), which index hybrid identities that are simultaneously global and Korean. In their construction of themselves as “Cools” who are wealthy and cosmopolitan, yuhaksaeng deployed newly-valued varieties of Korean language and culture as resources in the globalized new economy. This practice, however, resulted in limits to their acquisition of forms of English capital valued in the Canadian market. As a Korean middle class strategy for acquiring valuable forms of English capital, jogi yuhak is caught in tension: while the ideology of language as a skill and capital to help an individual's social mobility drives the jogi yuhak movement, the essentialist ideology of “authentic” English makes it impossible for Koreans to work it to their advantage. The thesis argues that in multilingual societies, ethnic/racial/linguistic minorities' limited access to the acquisition of linguistic competence is produced by existing inequality, rather than their limited linguistic proficiency contributing to their marginal position. To counter naturalized social inequality seemingly linguistic in nature, language education in globalization should move away from essentialism toward process- and practice-oriented approaches to language, community, and identity.",870401868,,Dissertations & Theses," Shin, HyunjungShinHyunjungShin, Hyunjung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2367505011 , 56193141 , 66569 , 9780494730072 , NR73007 , NR73007", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494730072, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/870401868?accountid=14496," 0279 Language arts , 0455 Multicultural Education"," 0279 Language arts , 0455 Multicultural Education"," 0279 Language arts , 0455 Multicultural Education",," 0279 Language arts , 0455 Multicultural Education"," Language arts , Multicultural Education , Study abroad , Globalization , Asian Canadians , Secondary school students , Foreign language learning , Sociolinguistics , Toronto Ontario Canada"," Education , Korean , Language learning , Study abroad , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CGireogi+gajok%E2%80%9D%3A+Transnationalism+and+language+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shin%2C+Hyunjung&amp;isbn=9780494730072&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"398,Open Networking in Central America: The Case of the Mesoamerican People's Forum,"This dissertation considers the case of the Mesoamerican People's Forum (MPF), a Central American ‘cousin’ of the World Social Forum, and manifestation of the Global Justice Movement. It argues that the MPF cannot be adequately understood as a transnational social movement or as an ‘open space.’ Rather, it is best understood as a political playing field on which the leaders of locally rooted social movements contested the future of the Central American left within an uncertain and changing political context. Based on extensive ethnographic field work and grounded analysis, it argues that well-placed actors within forum spaces can best be thought of as ‘mediators’ between state and society. The emergence of de facto federated governance structures in Central America, plus weak democratic institutions, have placed new pressures on mediators. Leaders within the Central American left find that they need to build up and/or maintain power bases to shield their positions within an uncertain political environment. They mobilize people to participate in transnational forum spaces because of the legitimating benefits, but shape networked flows within these spaces to limit the potential for networking to erode established positions. Thus I conclude that openness is neither the condition nor the objective of social forums, but rather a pawn strategically deployed or retracted in the course of networked interactions. The work advances thinking about the nature of collective political subjectivity in an era of transformationalist globalization. It also argues in favor of critical realist perspectives on collectivization in a post-development, globalizing world. Specifically, scholars can best advance an ‘epistemology of the south’ by promoting and protecting cognitive justice, which in turn can be achieved through the use of realist approaches that serve to uncover the practices of power at work within networked spaces.",870488223,,Dissertations & Theses," Reilly, Katherine M.

Researchers have used a variety of social science methods to study the dramatic social change that typically accompanies the creation of extractive reserves as communities bond into local social movements, build alliances with national and international organizations, and overturn longstanding patron-client relations through land reform processes. This research project employed the theoretical concepts of social capital combined with social network analysis and ethnographic interview techniques to conduct a study of how isolated residents of two extractive reserves in the southern part of Amazonas State use their personal social networks to access resources. Network analysis combined with ethnographic data collection techniques generated quantitative and qualitative data regarding the level of interaction and cooperation between government institutions, local organizations (such as trade unions), and reserve residents. In addition to providing information on what types of social networks have replaced the patron-client relations that have long been associated with rural Amazonia, social network analysis provided a new approach for measuring the access that extractive reserve residents have to markets, loans, and other types of capital. Natural rubber production was a key component of the economy of the municipality of Lábrea, in the southern part of Brazil’s Amazonas state, from the 1870s until the early 1980s. The production unit established to produce this commodity, the seringal , was characterized by rigid patron-client ties between rubber tappers and landowners. This social system has changed with the collapse of extractivism and the rise of social movements pursuing social justice and environmental conservation in the Amazon. In this dissertation I explain how the networks of inhabitants of the extractive reserves in the municipality of Lábrea transitioned from social systems dominated by a single patron to systems in which individuals used relationships with social movements, government agencies, and other actors to access resources. A better understanding of the social networks of reserve residents may improve the success rate of conservation and development projects in the reserves as well as provide useful information for policy makers as they make decisions regarding the decentralization of resource management in the region.",883386988,,Dissertations & Theses," Mathews, Mason ClayMathewsClayMasonMathews, Mason Clay",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2425087621 , 53843211 , 66569 , 9781124795133 , 3467581 , 3467581", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124795133, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/883386988?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Geography , Latin American Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Amazon , Brazil , Extractive reserves , Patron-client , Peasants , Social capital , Social networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Socio-economic+change+in+the+transition+from+patron-client+to+social+movement+networks+in+Brazilian+Amazonia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mathews%2C+Mason+Clay&amp;isbn=9781124795133&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"400,‘A community of the nations’: Institutional responses to Mexican migration at the urban edge,"This dissertation investigates the ways that community institutions transform in response to the arrival of a transnational migrant population. Using interviews and participant observation, I examine the impact of a working class Mexican immigrant population on two gateway institutions, churches and schools, in Aurora, Illinois, a community on the western edge of the Chicago metropolitan area. Since the 1990s Aurora's Mexican immigrant population has increased dramatically. The Chicago metropolitan area, like many others across the country, has experienced dramatic demographic and socio-economic changes as a consequence of global economic transformations occurring in recent decades. One of these changes is the movement of Mexican immigrants and their families to the outer suburbs. Combining key insights from the literatures on assimilation, transnationalism, and cosmopolitanism and reframing them for an analysis of change within local community institutions, I examine the consequences of assimilating transnational migrants, who maintain strong social, cultural, economic, and sometimes political connections to their homelands, for two of the cornerstone institutions of any community: churches and public schools. This perspective recognizes the intertwined nature of assimilation and transnationalism and acknowledges that migration has consequences not only for the migrants, but also for the communities in which they settle. My findings in Aurora suggest that one consequence of assimilating transnational migrants is the cosmopolitanization of local institutions, a process by which these institutions are reorienting themselves, albeit subtly, into a broader social, cultural, economic and political network that is not fully contained by the nation-state. In varying degrees Aurora's churches have altered their practices to incorporate elements of the language, culture, and religious rituals of the city's growing Mexican population. Similarly, a local school district responded by partnering with the Mexican government to develop a distance learning program for adult migrants and by recruiting teachers directly from Mexico. Globalization is transforming the nation and the world. This dissertation provides a useful analytic framework for understanding these transformations at the local and institutional level. In addition, the findings represent a cosmopolitanization of local institutions that is obscured by current perspectives and that has important implications for both immigrant and non-immigrant residents.",89190055,,Dissertations & Theses," Buntin, JenniferBuntinJenniferBuntin, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1999463891 , 51510271 , 66569 , 9781109689716 , 3397245 , 3397245", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109689716, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/89190055?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0340 Educational sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0318 Religion , 0340 Educational sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0318 Religion , 0340 Educational sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0318 Religion , 0340 Educational sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Religion , Educational sociology , Organizational behavior , Hispanic American studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Education , Cosmopolitanism , Education , Immigration , Institutional responses , Latino , Mexican , Religion , Urban edge",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%98A+community+of+the+nations%E2%80%99%3A+Institutional+responses+to+Mexican+migration+at+the+urban+edge&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Buntin%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9781109689716&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"401,Keeping the faith in global civil society: Illiberal democracy and the cases of reproductive rights and trafficking,"What constitutes global civil society? Are liberal assumptions about the nature of civil society as a realm autonomous from and balancing the power of the state and market transferrable to the global level? Does global civil society necessarily represent and/or result in the promotion of liberal values? These questions guided my dissertation which attempts to challenge dominant liberal conceptualizations of global civil society. To do so, it provides two representative case studies of how domestic and transnational factions of the Religious Right, acting in concert with (or as agents of) the US state, and the political opportunity structures it has provided under conservative regimes, gain access to global policy-making forums through a reframing of international human rights discourses and practices pertaining particularly to women's rights in order to shift them in illiberal directions. The study investigates the ways liberal international human rights regimes, which are commonly seen as representative of an emerging liberal global civil society separate from and acting as a check on state power, are particularly vulnerable to contestations involving value orientations that challenge liberal conceptions of human rights and liberal feminist conceptions of women's human rights. The concept of women's human rights gained ascendancy in global policy-making through the development of transnational feminist non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the 1970s onward. Such NGOs fit the liberal model of global civil society actors operating separate from state apparatuses to check human rights abuses enabled by states. By the 1990s, however, domestic and transnational Religious Right NGOs began to emerge, with significant financial and ideological state support, to explicitly counter liberal feminist constructions of women's human rights. The dissertation uses secondary historical studies, primary NGO, governmental, and intergovernmental organization (IGO) documents, and structuralist social movement analysis that focuses on framing through discourse and political opportunity structures and is informed by feminist constructivist approaches in International Relations. My case studies of Religious Right NGOs engaged in pro-family and anti-sex trafficking campaigns under the rubric of women's human rights reveal that: (1) the elasticity of human rights discourse makes it attractive for all manner of political claims by all manner of political groups, including illiberal ones; (2) the entry of the Religious Right as a human rights regime does not fit the prevailing model of global civil society in that it is heavily state-supported financially and ideologically nor does it make its human rights claims on the basis of liberal individualist principles; and, thus, (3) international human rights norms are becoming less the result of some alternative, autonomous, unified, and liberal-progressive ""third space"" that counters the state and more subject to strong alliances of conservative groups and states. This dissertation, theoretically and empirically, puts into question assumptions about the necessarily liberalizing nature of global civil society. It does this by uncovering how power operates within global civil society among NGOs as a result of their differential relations to the power of states and how these power differentials enable certain human rights frames to becomes dominant over others.",89209045,,Dissertations & Theses," Kamrani, MarjonKamraniMarjonKamrani, Marjon",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2018941471 , 51865341 , 66569 , 9781109707878 , 3398057 , 3398057", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109707878, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/89209045?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0616 International law"," 0453 Womens studies , 0616 International law"," 0453 Womens studies , 0616 International law",," 0453 Womens studies , 0616 International law"," Womens studies , International law , Democracy , Liberalism , Reproductive system , Human trafficking , Citizen participation"," Social sciences , Feminist constructivism , Global civil society , Human rights , Illiberal democracy , Reproductive rights , Sex trafficking",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Keeping+the+faith+in+global+civil+society%3A+Illiberal+democracy%0Aand+the+cases+of+reproductive+rights+and+trafficking&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kamrani%2C+Marjon&amp;isbn=9781109707878&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"402,The union local in post-Second World War Canada: A case study of UAW/CAW Local 27 from 1950 to 1990,"The local union was a crucial building block of the post-World War II labour movement in Canada. Local unions organized workers, negotiated collective agreements, and otherwise operated through the post-war labour relations system. They also pursued ambitious political and social agendas. United Auto Workers/Canadian Auto Workers Local 27 in London, Ontario was a large composite local that engaged in all of those activities in the post-war period. It grew to include thousands of members across thirty bargaining units. Local unions were the face of the labour movement for its members. Local 27 was not simply a creation of the national and international union administrations. It was the product of both rank-and-file activism and national and international union offices. Its agenda was subsequently influenced by all of those groups. They sought to represent their rank-and-file members and crafted bargaining and policy agendas that would help workers and their families. Local 27 was also shaped by the employers with whom it bargained. The local enjoyed more organizing successes than failures, but did not achieve uniform gains across all bargaining units. Local activists sought to forge a social and political agenda that would attract rank-and-file participation. That program centered on the local hall. These efforts, while well-intentioned, drew the same members who were already active in union activities. Some aspects of the local's social and political program were not successful. There were limits to what Local 27 could do in its members' lives. It provided them and their families with economic and lifestyle options, but it could not determine the personal decisions that people made. Local 27's story in the post-war decades involved both successes and failures. It engaged in many strikes, endured plant closures, and pursued a continuous stream of grievances and arbitrations. However, its success in the workplace was not always replicated in the broader community. It was an organization rooted in the workplace, rather than a community organization. This fundamental aspect of its nature brought Local 27 success in the workplace, but limited what it could do beyond it.",901131110,,Dissertations & Theses," Russell, JasonRussellJasonRussell, Jason",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2498924171 , 54140781 , 66569 , 9780494805770 , NR80577 , NR80577", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494805770, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/901131110?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0510 Economics , 0629 Labor relations"," 0334 Canadian history , 0510 Economics , 0629 Labor relations"," 0334 Canadian history , 0510 Economics , 0629 Labor relations",," 0334 Canadian history , 0510 Economics , 0629 Labor relations"," Canadian history , Economics , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Postwar , UAW/CAW , Union local , United Auto Workers/Canadian Auto Workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+union+local+in+post-Second+World+War+Canada%3A+A+case+study%0Aof+UAW%2FCAW+Local+27+from+1950+to+1990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Russell%2C+Jason&amp;isbn=9780494805770&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"403,The public understanding of climate change: A case study of Taiwanese youth,"Global climate change is likely to be the most challenging environmental dilemma of the 21st century because its impacts on ecosystems and human society are transnational in scale and long term in scope. Due to its high scientific complexity and uncertainty and high political and economic sensitivity, mitigating the problem will require interdisciplinary cooperation and collective and sustained efforts on the part of all nations. Sufficient domestic support from both government and the lay public will not only be significant to the success of an international climate regime, but also crucial to the effectiveness of potential domestic climate policies. Such circumstances call for exploration of how the level of the public’s scientific understanding of climate change influences choices for climate protective actions and support for climate policies. Social scientists have the responsibility to explore how people perceive, understand, and respond to global climate change and to investigate the roles and interrelationships of various actors (e.g., scientists, citizens, and elected and appointed officials) in the policy-making process. Compared with numerous social scientific studies of global climate change in North America and Europe, substantially fewer investigations have focused on other regions of the world. Therefore, this doctoral research presents a case study of domestic climate policy formulation premised on the integration of science and citizens in an industrialized Asian society—Taiwan. This dissertation reports the views of Taiwanese youth with respect to global climate change based on data compiled from three empirical studies (i.e., integrated assessment focus groups, pre- and post-surveys, and a web-based survey). These studies in combination present three primary findings: (1) Most Taiwanese young adults tend to endorse pro-climate protection attitudes and behaviors; (2) These young adults display an extensive but limited scientific understanding pertaining to the problem; (3) A process of experimental participation with scientists enhanced individual scientific understanding and policy making. Further investigation revealed that these perceptions were grounded in a strong sense of ecological citizenship, which is likely influenced by the contemporary environmental movement in Taiwan since the 1980s. While this case study finds that scientific knowledge is less influential in determining individual behavioral intentions than public attitudes toward climate change, the continual enhancement of public ethical awareness about global climate change provides a helpful approach for policy makers seeking to obtain public support.",917457409,,Dissertations & Theses," Kuo, Shih-YunKuoShih-YunKuo, Shih-Yun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2568887741 , 66517771 , 66569 , 9781267106377 , 3492329 , 3492329", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781267106377, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/917457409?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0626 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science"," 0404 Climate Change , 0626 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science"," 0404 Climate Change , 0626 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science",," 0404 Climate Change , 0626 Sociology , 0768 Environmental science"," Climate Change , Sociology , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Earth sciences , Climate change , Public understanding , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+public+understanding+of+climate+change%3A+A+case+study+of+Taiwanese+youth&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kuo%2C+Shih-Yun&amp;isbn=9781267106377&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"404,"Will globalization play in Peoria? Class, race and nation in the global economy, 1948–2000","Deindustrialization and the globalization of labor processes fundamentally altered the lives of working-class Americans, both at work and in their communities, in the second half of the twentieth century. As a result, unions and especially the industrial workers belonging to them existed in a far different, less certain, and less optimistic world than their counterparts at the end of World War Two. America’s economic and industrial hegemony after the war buckled under the assault from within, especially with the proliferation of global manufacturing systems, and without through intensified foreign competition. Plant closings and technological changes such as computerization and automation jeopardized working-class prospects for upward mobility through manual labor. Once-dominant labor unions in manufacturing industries such as earthmoving equipment, steel, auto, electronics, and textiles suffered steep and, thus far, irreversible losses in numbers and strength. The consequences have been deep and largely deleterious, with workers facing heightened competition for good paying but increasingly scarce industrial jobs, the drastic decline and political influence of organized labor, and a radically recalibrated balance of power in labor relations in favor of employers. This dissertation examines the globalization of work processes, the destructive forces and consequences of deindustrialization, and their impact on labor relations between Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers from 1948 to 2000. It analyzes the ways in which workers as laboring consumers experienced, understood, and responded to the increasingly interconnected and unstable global economy in the postwar period. In the process, the dissertation proffers a critique of labor relations in the US, the bureaucratic unionism that has become entrenched within it, and the struggles within unions and local communities. Incorporating social, labor, and business history, this study contributes to the literature on globalization and the decline of the labor movement by connecting myriad sites such as the shop floor, local communities, federal policies, and transnational trade and labor-relations strategies. Utilizing myriad archival sources such as corporate and union newspapers, grievance and arbitration cases, and internal union documents, as well as oral histories with current and former Caterpillar workers and UAW officials, the dissertation illustrates the complex and often constraining nexus of social, economic, political, and nationalistic forces facing workers in a declining industrial landscape.",1009735383,,Dissertations & Theses," Kozlowski, JasonKozlowskiJasonKozlowski, Jason",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2643944581 , 65292091 , 66569 , 9781267273246 , 3503638 , 3503638", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267273246, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1009735383?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Caterpillar, Inc. , Deindustrialization , Globalization , Illinois , Labor history , Peoria , United Auto Workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Will+globalization+play+in+Peoria%3F+Class%2C+race+and+nation+in+the+global+economy%2C+1948%E2%80%932000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kozlowski%2C+Jason&amp;isbn=9781267273246&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"405,"Canada's other Red scare: Rights, decolonization, and Indigenous political protest in the Global Sixties","This dissertation examines the histories of Indigenous protest, commonly known as “Red Power,” in the 1960s and 1970s in the town of Kenora, Ontario. Among the themes discussed are the associations of Indian and M6tis activists with Third World national liberation movements, Black Power groups in North America and other Indigenous organizations, such as the American Indian Movement. This study pursues numerous themes, including: racialization, transnational decolonization, Canadian national identity and regional history. While previous studies on the era popularly understood as “the sixties” tend to focus on the particularities of the Canadian context, this dissertation suggests that the changing nature of Indigenous protest during the 1960s and 1970s forms a crucial link between Canada and global forces of social change that defined this era. Moments of Indigenous protest in Kenora, were not just singular episodes. Instead, actions such as the main street march in 1965 and the Anicinabe Park takeover in 1974 episode should be placed within the national and global movement of armed standoffs, occupations, and civil disobedience and understood through the broader social, cultural and political frameworks of decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s.",1010421948,,Dissertations & Theses," Rutherford, ScottRutherfordScottRutherford, Scott",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2648215371 , 68744082 , 66569 , 9780494784433 , NR78443 , NR78443", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494784433, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1010421948?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies"," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies"," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies",," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies"," Canadian history , Native American studies"," Social sciences , 1960s , 1970s , Decolonization , History , Indigenous , Ontario , Political protest , Red Power",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Canada%27s+other+Red+scare%3A+Rights%2C+decolonization%2C+and+Indigenous+political+protest+in+the+Global+Sixties&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rutherford%2C+Scott&amp;isbn=9780494784433&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"406,‘Vietnam: It's Our War Too’: The Antiwar Movement in Canada: 1963–1975,"No single issue more defines the latter half of the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s as the Vietnam War and the movement that opposed it. While this movement was centered in the United States, it was not limited to that country. Rather, it was international, involving marches and rallies in all six continents. Canada was very much a part of this social phenomenon. For almost ten years – 1964 to 1973 – Canadians actively participated in opposing American intervention in Indochina. At its height, this movement was national in scale, extending from British Columbia to Newfoundland. While at times American émigrés participated in this movement, leaders and participants were, by and large, Canadian. However, from its start, antiwar activism was shaped by the larger international movement. In its earliest phase the Communist Party of Canada – and by extension the larger international Communist movement with its leadership in the Soviet Union – played a vanguard role in the antiwar movement in Canada. The Communist Party, however, did not retain leadership of the movement. For a short while the Student Union for Peace Action – influenced by new left groups in the United States, specifically Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) – took on this role. By the late 1960s, however, the Trotskyist movement, affiliated to the Fourth International and with strong ties with the Socialist Workers' Party in the United States, had risen to be the undisputed leader of the anti-Vietnam War movement in Canada. Throughout the life of the Canadian movement it was strongly influenced by numerous international influences. Despite the unmistakable national and international dimensions of the movement, there was clearly a special relationship with the antiwar movement in the United States. Most of the major antiwar campaigns in Canada were part of larger ones coordinated south of the border. This began prior to the deployment of combat troops in March 1965 and was apparent throughout the earliest International Days of Protest to End the War in Vietnam. Such a relationship continued through the Mobilization to End the War as well as the Moratorium movement. Reaction in Canada to the invasion of Cambodia and the subsequent shootings at Kent State University clearly showed the strong the relationship between the Canadian and American antiwar movements. Following the events of May 1970 the movement steadily declined, both internationally and in Canada.

The Narrative is situated within a conceptual apparatus formed from the rhetoric of pathos, Lee Edelman's assertion that children shape the political and are the recipients of political interventions, Slajov Zizek's choix-force and the psychotic move, Vivana Zelizer's nineteenth-century sentimentalization and sacralization movements, and Masser and Creed's song ""The Greatest Love of All."" Using both academic and popular sources to articulate the Narrative and its intuitive reproduction within communities shows that while the Narrative is the organic outcome of nineteenth century social reform and child labor movements, it is still applicable today. The Narrative is not merely present within popular culture and academia, but is also informing practical decisions in education, politics, and humanitarian agencies. As the theoretical and practical applications converge, three categories of the child emerge: the National Child, the Known Child, and the Global Child. These three categories, the imagined community of the child, and the Narrative of the Child form the mechanisms through which a nation becomes part of the global community that treats all children as the Known Child. Through the use of the choix-force , the child as recipient of all decisions, and the Narrative and its activation of pathos, the child becomes the bond which both creates and holds the global community together and activates the global biopolitical on behalf of the world's children.",1285537244,,Dissertations & Theses," Layng-Awasthi, TraceyLayng-AwasthiTraceyLayng-Awasthi, Tracey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2888662721 , 71973182 , 66569 , 9781267888013 , 3551261 , 3551261", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267888013, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1285537244?accountid=14496, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric,, 0681 Rhetoric, Rhetoric," Language, literature and linguistics , Child abuse , Global biopolitical , Pathos , Unknown child",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Child%2C+the+Narrative%2C+and+the+Global+Biopolitical&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Layng-Awasthi%2C+Tracey&amp;isbn=9781267888013&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"408,"The Right to the Slum? Redevelopment, Rule and the Politics of Difference in Mumbai","This dissertation engages a central paradox concerning spatial transformation in Mumbai today. It asks how elite-biased, global-city redevelopment interventions entailing the mass displacement of the urban poor are made politically feasible in an ostensibly democratic city with strong working-class movements. In unraveling this paradox, it offers a perspective that diverges from recent scholarly debates on social movements in Indian cities and neoliberal urban governance. The urban social movements literature has focused on the agency of the poor, seeing new slum mobilizations as a burgeoning form of substantive democracy through which the poor access their needs. Neoliberal governance debates position states and logics of rule as the primary agents facilitating transnational capital accumulation through new spatial practices in cities and regions. Instead, this research on the politics of slum eviction shows how differentiated social mobilizations are deeply intertwined with and constitutive of a changing state and its redevelopmental interventions. Through a comparative ethnography of the politics of eviction, this dissertation makes two interconnected arguments. First, it shows how the structure and operation of the state has shifted to politically facilitate large-scale projects and en masse slum removal. In such new configurations, the urban poor no longer have the ability to leverage their votes in exchange for governmental compensation. Instead, bureaucracies have centralized control of redevelopment processes while unevenly distributing displacement compensation, via market mechanisms, through NGOs, social movements and other non-state actors. Second, it demonstrates how changing meanings and historically sedimented practices of social mobilization around eviction in Mumbai are central to these transformations in redevelopmental governance. It draws on a Gramscian conceptualization of the state and hegemony to understand how redevelopment is advanced, thwarted and negotiated. Hegemony, as Gramsci understood it, is a historically specific set of processes through which the interests of dominant classes are secured. The hegemonic state is a site of social struggle within and beyond its formal structures operating in and through a variety of interconnected institutions, civil society groups and social relations. As the apparatus of the redevelopment interests of elite classes in Mumbai, state hegemony has operated through a mix of force, negotiation and consent in multiple arenas through which evicted slum residents, NGOs, movements and other representative agents have become significant political actors. Redevelopmental hegemony also operates in the realm of meanings and cultural formations, what Gramsci called ethico-political struggles. This ethico-political dimension is immensely important in Mumbai's redevelopment and eviction processes. Because of a history of development in which class struggles over urban land and housing have articulated with gender and with Hindu-nationalist and regionalist identity politics, eviction has engendered differentiated experiences and politics. Furthermore, non-state intermediaries shape collective subjectivities by drawing on histories of struggle as well as globally circulating development and rights-based discourses. Accordingly, evicted slum dwellers have occupied highly contradictory positions—challenging, enabling and reworking redevelopment interventions through their aspirations and ethico-political claims to space. The dissertation explores three political trajectories of eviction in ethnographic relational comparison—a method grounded in the idea that differentiated political practices and interconnections are crucial for understanding power-laden spatial processes like redevelopment and displacement. In all three cases, the experience and politics of eviction operated along three axes of difference: class, gender and ethno-religious identity. In the first case, gendered participation and NGO-mediation helped to suture cooperation with market-based resettlement for a World Bank-funded transport infrastructure project. In the second case, slum residents evicted for road construction under the same transport project contested forced displacement with the assistance of a lawyer in a transnational forum citing infractions of World Bank resettlement norms and loss of income. In the third case, evicted slum residents—many having marginalized ethno-religious identities—aligned with a social movement highly critical of neoliberal development and resisted state violence and uncompensated displacement as citizens excluded from the city and nation. Through this comparative exploration of struggles over meaning and space, this study shows that difference—in the socio-spatial experience and in the practices of representation and mediation of eviction—serves to rework state power and its capacity to advance the cultural politics of belonging and the political economy of global-city redevelopment.",1441339177,,Dissertations & Theses," Doshi, Sapana Lisa DilipkumarDoshiLisa DilipkumarSapanaDoshi, Sapana Lisa Dilipkumar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3096307381 , 64424861 , 66569 , 9781303371608 , 3593776 , 3593776", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781303371608, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1441339177?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Geography , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Cultural politics , Development , Mumbai , Slum evictions , Social movements , Urban geography , Working class",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Right+to+the+Slum%3F+Redevelopment%2C+Rule+and+the+Politics+of+Difference+in+Mumbai&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Doshi%2C+Sapana+Lisa+Dilipkumar&amp;isbn=9781303371608&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"409,The legitimacy of indigenous peoples' norms under international law,"I assess Indigenous peoples’ norms under international law against a definition of legitimacy that draws on contemporary international relations and international legal scholarship, especially that of Thomas Franck in addition to constructivism, transnational legal process theory and social movement theory. I argue that Indigenous peoples’ norms under intentional law carry legitimacy. As such, they have both the capacity and the potential to pull states into compliance. First, Indigenous peoples’ norms under international law have ‘procedural legitimacy.’ While the proliferation of international institutions engaged in international law making on Indigenous peoples’ norms undermines the transparency and certainty ideal in a law-making process, the international legal system has reflexively countered these legitimacy deficits with institutional cooperation and robust law-making procedures. In addition, this procedural legitimacy is enhanced by Indigenous peoples’ participation in international law-making as it realises their just claims to self-determination and to deliberative law-making. Likewise, Indigenous peoples’ norms under international law have ‘substance legitimacy’: international law is ultimately fairer as a result of the content of these norms. Indeterminacy and incoherence caused by the fragmentation of international Indigenous peoples’ norms, which can be legitimacy negative, have been mitigated by dialogue between institutions making and applying Indigenous peoples’ norms. Dialogic interactions minimise conflict between, and inconsistent articulations of, Indigenous peoples’ norms sourced in different international instruments, as well as the broader incoherence in the principles undergirding them, restoring some clarity to the law. Finally, state engagement with norms in international and domestic for a, often propelled by non-state actor initiatives, leads them over time to internalise international norms, which is increasingly the result of states’ interaction with Indigenous peoples’ norms under international law. In becoming internalised, what I term the ‘engagement legitimacy’ of international norms is enhanced.",1442493916,,Dissertations & Theses," Charters, Claire Winfield NgamihiChartersWinfield NgamihiClaireCharters, Claire Winfield Ngamihi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101209561 , 71128132 , 101309 , U598534 , U598534", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442493916?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIU598534 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+legitimacy+of+indigenous+peoples%27+norms+under+international+law&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Charters%2C+Claire+Winfield+Ngamihi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"410,Critical rationalism and macrosociology of globalisation,"This thesis employs Critical Rationalism—an inter-subjective theory of rationality originated in Karl Popper’s conjectural theory of knowledge— in order to develop a new macrosociology of globalisation. It describes contemporary globalisation as the formation of a liberal globality through which the centrality of the Hobbesian struggle for political power has been superseded with the Lockean competition for economic interests. But the thesis argues that liberal globalisation suffers from fundamental societal deficits due to a global organisation of people based on economic competition rather than rational dialogue and social cooperation. The central question of thesis therefore is that ‘how emerging utilitarian-based liberal globality can be transformed into a global society of free and equal citizens?’ The thesis argues that people’s potential access to critical rationality enables them to agree upon one set of globally shared values concerning the equality of people and people-centric global institutions, which are required for creating a global society of free and equal citizens. Through its macrosociological analysis the thesis addresses the question of how such a system of globally shared values can operate as the cultural driving force of a radical global institutional change from the Lockean logic of economic competition to the Kantian logic of dialogue and social cooperation. The thesis concludes that intellectuals can employ the ideal-type of an open global society of free and equal persons in order to persuade global social movements to work for realising such a fundamental global institutional change towards a just and free global society.",1508803080,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohammadi Alamuti, MasoudMohammadi AlamutiMasoudMohammadi Alamuti, Masoud",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3251386471 , 86264672 , 101309 , U606996 , U606996 , http://hdl.handle.net/10443/1431", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1508803080?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://hdl.handle.net/10443/1431 , 566928 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Critical+rationalism+and+macrosociology+of+globalisation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohammadi+Alamuti%2C+Masoud&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"411,"States, movements and the new politics of blackness in Colombia and Brazil","The 1990s marked a dramatic shift throughout Latin America from constitutions and state policies that hinged on ideas of colorblindness and mestizaje to targeted policies for black and indigenous peoples. This study analyzes the role black social movements played in this shift in Colombia and Brazil, two countries where the state adopted the most comprehensive reforms for black populations in the region. It also analyzes the impact of achieving such reforms on black movements' trajectories in the two countries. In so doing, I not only examine how black movements are shaped by the political context in which they emerge, but how they are able to reconfigure that political context in ways that ultimately reshape black movements themselves. Drawing on 18 months of fieldwork including in-depth interviews, archival analysis, and ethnographic methods, this study reveals new ways of understanding ethno-racial politics in these countries and offers insights about the relationship between movements and the state, as well as contestation within movements. Further, in examining how black movements seize upon changes in the global political field, appropriate global discourses into local struggles, and build transnational alliances, this work also challenges us to integrate the constant interplay between global and local processes into our analyses, especially when our aim is to understand social movement dynamics in the Global South. In the first part of the dissertation, I show how the rise of global policy norms around multiculturalism, and the Durban World Conference against Racism, provided political openings for black movements in Colombia and Brazil, respectively. However, I maintain that it was the interplay between such global factors and national political developments paired with strategic action by black movements that best explains states' adoption of these historic reforms. Even so, while both countries adopted policies for black populations beginning in the 1990s, the dominant discourse around black rights in Brazil centers on notions of ""the right to equality"" and inclusion, whereas black issues in Colombia are largely framed in terms of the ""right to difference"", culture, territory and autonomy. I suggest that these discursive differences have as much to do with how black populations were historically imagined by the state in the two cases, as they do with the different discursive tactics used by black movements when making demands on the state. The second part examines the consequences of the shift to ethno-racial legislation on internal black movement dynamics in the two countries. More specifically, I analyze the nature of formal structures of political participation set up for black populations in response to movement pressure. I do this by examining how movement actors negotiate, inhabit and contest such spaces, revealing a reality of social movement institutionalization that is much more complex than the literature suggests. Whereas black movements in Brazil have been absorbed into mainstream politics within a relatively democratic state, black movements in Colombia have either been repressed violently or institutionalized into precarious alternative political structures leading to unique internal movement dynamics. In order to understand the relationship between structure and agency as well as ntional and international political processes in these two cases, I propose the conceptual framework of national and global political fields which I argue contributes both to the literature on race in Latin America and social movements.",1525820678,,Dissertations & Theses," Paschel, Tianna ShontaPaschelShontaTiannaPaschel, Tianna Shonta",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3307435781 , 87679742 , 66569 , 9781303829574 , 3616147 , 3616147", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781303829574, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1525820678?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," African American Studies , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Affirmative action , Globalization , Latin america , Multiculturalism , Race and ethnicity , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=States%2C+movements+and+the+new+politics+of+blackness+in+Colombia+and+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paschel%2C+Tianna+Shonta&amp;isbn=9781303829574&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"412,Getting Nurses Here: Migration Industry and the Business of Connecting Philippine-Educated Nurses with United States Employers,"In this dissertation, I analyze how formal organizations and institutions construct an international market for labor and a corresponding industry for migration-related services. Focusing on the migration industry, I scrutinize the sector that is comprised of private recruitment and placement agencies and its intervening role in the market for foreign-educated nurses. Much of the literature on international migration focuses on the role of informal social networks in furthering international labor flows. My study, however, brings in insight from economic sociology and organizational studies to show that the movement of international labor can also be understood as a market, comprised of several organizational fields that profoundly shape the recruitment and migration of workers. I thus show that intermediary organizations provide alternative solutions to resolving market challenges (e.g. property rights, governance structures, and rules of exchange) where other social structures, such as informal social networks, may not or cannot. The dynamic relationship between formal organizations, institutions, social networks, and migration is important to model as today's migration processes are becoming increasingly complex and bound together with business interests. These conclusions are based on two years of fieldwork in the Philippines and United States, during which I conducted 98 in-depth interviews with nurses and leading representatives of several organizations and institutions. These organizations included nursing schools, sending and receiving governments, commercial recruitment and placement agencies, and employing hospitals. This research design allowed me to not only trace the social processes of the migration from origin to destination, but also to examine the migration system at different levels of analysis: from the individual decision making of nurses, to the meso-level organization of formal intermediaries and brokers in the system, and finally to the macro-level involvement of state institutions.",1525990027,,Dissertations & Theses," Acacio, Kristel Ann SantiagoAcacioAnn SantiagoKristelAcacio, Kristel Ann Santiago",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3308356291 , 87702042 , 66569 , 9781303829246 , 3616115 , 3616115", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781303829246, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1525990027?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," Labor relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , Formal prganizations , International labor migration , Markets , Migration industry , Nursing , Philippines",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Getting+Nurses+Here%3A+Migration+Industry+and+the+Business+of+Connecting+Philippine-Educated+Nurses+with+United+States+Employers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Acacio%2C+Kristel+Ann+Santiago&amp;isbn=9781303829246&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"413,Stuck in Traffic: Sexual Politics and Criminal Injustice in Social Movements Against Human Trafficking,"This dissertation analyzes the sexual politics of transnational movements against human trafficking. I track the periodic securitization of women's migration and commercial sexual exploitation in international affairs from the Victorian-era movement against ""White Slavery"" to the contemporary campaign against ""modern day slavery"" and sex trafficking, using the case of Thailand to investigate the role of women's advocates in the transformation of governance strategies to address the issue. Drawing on a year of field research in Thailand, I analyze the development of collaborative, inter-agency organizations that partner non-governmental organization (""NGO"") advocates with criminal justice and social welfare officials to implement ""rights-based"" measures to prevent trafficking, protect victims, and prosecute offenders. I examine the rise of the anti-trafficking movement in Thailand to explore the complex interplay between the state, civil society organizations, and transnational advocacy networks, as well as movement organizations' strategic mobilization of domestic and international law to pressure states for policy reform. The following chapters demonstrate the complex ways different social movement organizations and state agents engage women's rights to frame interventions, attract media and financial resources, and secure political influence to advance diverse goals in both local and international forums. I explore the tension between rights-based and crime control approaches to trafficking and labor exploitation by analyzing the divergent incentives of different actors in the processing of trafficking cases. The dissertation reveals how efforts to advance women's rights through criminal justice interventions often operate to create collateral consequences for the very groups they intend to assist and empower.",1526012799,,Dissertations & Theses," Kinney, Edith Celine MarieKinneyCeline MarieEdithKinney, Edith Celine Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3308581561 , 87707712 , 66569 , 9781303831676 , 3616326 , 3616326", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781303831676, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1526012799?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology"," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology"," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology",," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology"," Law , Sociology , Criminology"," Social sciences , Advocacy , Rights , Sex work , Social movements , Thailand , Trafficking",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Stuck+in+Traffic%3A+Sexual+Politics+and+Criminal+Injustice+in+Social+Movements+Against+Human+Trafficking&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kinney%2C+Edith+Celine+Marie&amp;isbn=9781303831676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"414,"Epistemologies of possibility: social movements, knowledge production and political transformation","Urgent global problems-whether military conflicts, economic insecu rities, immigration controls or mass inca rceration-not only call for new modes of po litical action but also demand new forms of knowledge. For if knowledge frameworks both shape the horizons of social intelli gi bil ity and chart t he realms of political possibility, then epistemological interventions constitute a crucial part of social change. Social movements play a key role in th is work by engaging in dissident knowledge practices that open up space for political transformation. But what are the processes and conditions through which social movements generate new ways of knowing?'What is politically at sta~e in the various knowledge strategies that activists use to generate social change? Despite a growing lite ratu re on the role of epistemological dimensions of protest, social movement studies tend to neglect specific questions of epistemological change. Often treating knowledge as a resource or object rather than a power relation and a socia l practice, social movement scholars tend to focus on content rather than production, frames rather than practices, taxonomies rather than processes. Missing is a more dynamic account of the conditions, means and power relations through which transformative knowledge practices come to be constituted and deployed. Seeking to better understand processes of epistemological transformation, this thesis explores the relationship between social movements, knowledge production and pol itical change. Starting from an assumption that knowledge not only represents the world, but also works to constitute it, th is thesis examines the role of social movement knowledge practices in shaping the conditions of political possi bility. Drawing from the context of grassroots queer, transgender and feminist organizing around issues of prisons and border controls in North America, the project explores how activists generate new forms of knowledge and forge new spaces of political possibility.

Out of sensitivity and attention to the gender differences, many major issues relating to power, security, war and peace, ect, in this international relations have gotten a full range of criticism and re-interpretation, and also in this process, the Feminism IR Theory has formed gradually. The author tries to explore the origin of the Feminism IR Theory from the Realism IR Theory, Constructivism IR Theory and the feminism political movements. After the feminism movements, all kinds of Feminism IR Theory schools have come into being. Based on the cognitive theory, they can be classified into three types: the Empiristic Feminism IR Theory, the Standpoint Feminism IR Theory and the Postmodernism Feminism IR Theory. The author elaborates the three types respectively in details. As to the core conception of the International Relationship Theory: power, security, war and peace, the author makes a profound comparative analysis on how the Feminism IR Theory sublates these core conception in the perception of social gender, and how it gives its own opinion on the basis of criticizing and reconstructing these core conceptions. In the end, the author not only summarized the research achievements of this theory, but also pointed out the deficiencies and defects in the epistemology and methodology, on which future development prospects are based. Besides, some suggestions to the future orientation have been given, including integration of the various factions of the dominant epistemology, acceptance to positivist research methods, ways to build more perfect principles of the epistemology and methodology, and more cooperation and communication with non-feminism theory.

Specifically it is the basic understanding on the nature and law of motion of money. This thesis attempts to represent the formation of Marx's scientific outlook on money along the lines of logic and historical methodology, which plays an important and fundamental role. For this reason, this thesis analyzes and summarizes the framework and ideas of Marx's scientific outlook on money, from the perspectives of historical materialism, the object dimension of historical materialism and the subject dimension of historical materialism. Prior to the formation of historical materialism, Marx understands the nature of money from the point view of the alienation of human nature. Marx's early thoughts remain abstract due to the abstract nature of the concept of alienated labor. Marx makes use of fundamental principles of historical materialism involving the dialectical movement law of productive forces and production relations, the analysis of dialectical relationship between historical subject and object and the consistency of logic and history, to provide scientific answers to a set of issues including money's emergence, nature, flow, and destiny, which formalizes the complete and active theory system of Marx's scientific outlook on money. In economic and philosophical terms, this thesis investigates Marx's scientific outlook on money in the object and subject dimension of historical materialism, draws main conclusions as follows. First, money by nature exists independent of the nature of commodity, which is the social form of commodity. Second, as the media of capital movement, money's contradictoriness is the result of contradictory capital movement, and currency laws should be based on the endogenous money supply. Money reacts upon capital movement to exacerbate the contradictoriness of capital movement by means of independent money operation such as credit system. This is the money movement rule. Third, the mystery of money fetishism derives from the principle that historical object (capitalistic production relations) reacts upon historical subject, and money plays the media role of capitalistic enslavedness by materials. In the light of these points of view, this thesis argues that Marx's scientific outlook on money is insightful to current international financial crisis, explores the significance of Marx's endogenous money supply theory and Marx's thoughts on money's enslavedness by materials, for China's monetary policy and building the system of socialist core",1869987889,,Dissertations & Theses," Yang, Xing YeYangYeXingYang, Xing Ye",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315601581 , 111166012 , 189128 , 10515164 , 10515164", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869987889?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10515164 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Marx%27s+scientific+outlook+on+money&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yang%2C+Xing+Ye&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"419,Comparative study of nationalism in china and korea after the first world war,"Translation from original language as provided by author China and Korean peninsula are linked by common mountains and rivers and are closely related to and naturally interdependent on each other. Since ancient times, the two countries have enjoyed a close relationship with an exchange history of several thousand years. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, China and South Korea not only shared the experience of passive modernization caused by the invasion of the western culture, but also had the common confrontation of national crisis arising from external aggression. After the First World War, with the rise of oriental nationalism and the advance of socialist movements, the world colonial system formed under the global expansion of western colonialism at the end of the 19th century began to collapse. The subsequent national liberation movement in the vast colonial and semi-colonial countries and areas in Asia, Africa and Latin America was a ""national self-awakening"" movement pursuing ""national self-determination"" under the flag of nationalism. China and South Korea were no exceptions. Both countries witnessed many nationalist movements in the process of saving and revitalizing the two countries, such as the May Fourth Movement, the Non-Christian Movement, the Movement for the Recovery of Education and the Anti-Japanese Goods Movement in China and the March First Movement, Anti-Christian Movement, the New Education Outreach Campaign and the Products Awards Movement in Korea. On the basis of these movements formed the nationalism-grounded ideas of democracy, freedom and equality. Therefore, it can be said that the ""national salvation"" spirit and the nationalism of the two countries have promoted their new cultural movements. Nationalism plays an important part in the modernization process and the development process of nationalism in China and in South Korea is the process of their modernization, for at that time a country must enter into the tide of modernization if it were to fight for or maintain its national independence and to secure development. At a certain stage of historical development, people of China and South Korea, taking the opportunity of external stimuli and raising the national awareness through the cohesion of cultural heritage that they are dependent on, begin to realize their own respective ""national community"" in contact with foreign forces. Nationalism in China and in South Korea has many similarities due to the same international and social environment as well as the common goals. However, the two countries are different in social nature. Though South Korea was not completely free from the influence of feudalism, it was politically reduced to a colonial society in 1910. While China was still a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, though the rule of Qing dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was built, hence ending the feudalism system in the year of 1911. Because of the differences in the modes of the invasion the two countries suffered from imperialism and the reaction of the two countries to the external forces, the crisis the two countries faced and the countermeasures they adopted were different. Therefore, nationalist movements in China and South Korea appear naturally different features with both similarities and differences, which form the basis of study and comparison. Dividing nationalism roughly into political nationalism, cultural nationalism and economic nationalism, this essay intends to analyze the nationalism in China and in South Korea from the aspects of politics, culture and economy with a historical-comparative method, expounds the similarities and differences between China's nationalism and South Korea's nationalism and then further analyze the features of nationalism in the two",1870234290,,Dissertations & Theses," Bai, Ji LongBaiLongJiBai, Ji Long",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315907781 , 111160542 , 189128 , 10549966 , 10549966", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870234290?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAI10549966 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Comparative+study+of+nationalism+in+china+and+korea+after+the+first+world+war&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bai%2C+Ji+Long&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"420,The case studies on ethnic nationalism of the developing countries,"Translation from original language as provided by author From the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 to the Indian Movement over Latin America, from the disintegration of former Yugoslavia to China's ""3 14"" and ""7 5"" events, the ethnic nationalist movements in developing countries has become one of the most notable international problems since the Drastic Changes of Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Ethnic nationalism is a kind of ideology and social movement, based on ethnic identity, primarily from the cultural level (especially with the ethnic-related traditions, customs, language, etc.) to define themselves. This paper reviews the context of the development of nationalism theories, and put forward a classification map of the nationalism researches. Based on those theoretical analyses, this paper proposes a structured annalistic framework to explain the ethnic nationalism incidents emerged in developing countries since the 1990s. First, the paper argues that globalization is the structural determinants that promote the occurrence of ethnic nationalism in developing countries, especially the technological progress represented by the Internet provide the most convenient means of communication for them. Secondly, this paper argues that the rushing ahead democratic reforms in developing countries after the Drastic Changes of Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is one of the institutional causes of the ethnic nationalism incidents emerged in developing countries. Finally, the paper argues that a large number of international regimes related to minority groups is another important institutional cause of the ethnic nationalism incidents emerged in developing countries. First, this paper takes the 1994 genocide in Rwanda as an example to illustrate the logical relations between democratic reforms under poor conditions and ethnic nationalist movements. Second, this paper takes Indian Movements in Mexico, Peru, Chile and Bolivia as cases study to explain the logical relations between international regimes and ethnic nationalism. Finally, this paper also analyzes the ethnic issues in our country by the structured annalistic framework of the ethnic nationalism.

Under the context of globalization and integration, both the labor unions and non-state actors, such as human rights and environmental organizations within Mexico and U.S. achieve a transnational cooperation across national boundaries, issues and social classes in terms of transnational advocacy networks, by incorporating traditional issue of protecting labor rights into the new course of human rights and social justice.

Within 3 years, the problem of opium and drugs which ran rampant for more than two hundred years was effectively and basically handled at its source, creating a well-known miracle. At that time, according to the orders of the Central Government and Central South Stratocracy Committee, Guangzhou Government took an active part in the movement, solved with the problem of drugs-flooding which wasn't forbidden by Guangzhou previous governments and became one of the creators of the miracle. This paper focuses on the research of the movement of opium-forbidden and anti-drugs in the initial period of New China (1949-1952), tracing back to the historical reasons, investing the situation and characteristics of opium in that period, furthermore systematically discussing the movement of opium-forbidden and anti-drugs and its effective results, so that precious experience and lessons were drawn, which provide a historical reference for current drugs-fighting. The main of this thesis is divided into four parts, and the third and fourth parts are the key contents in this thesis. The first part introduces emphatically the opium and drugs' situations, which is introduced from four aspects,including planting, production and sales, trafficking and snorting, and the reasons of drugs-flooding, which is explained from four fields, including social history, geography environment, the characteristics of opium and drugs, and the individual quality of the opium users. The second part analyses systematically the reasons of resolute opium-forbidden and anti-drugs policy in the Initial Period of New China in Guangzhou. There are many reasons which not only include the international and domestic anti-drugs environment, but also contain the harm of opium and drugs to the people's physical and mental health, society, national economy and the authority cadres, which reached the point to ban. The third part discusses systematically the process and effective results of opium-forbidden and anti-drugs movement in the Initial Period of New China in Guangzhou. This movement is divided into three stages, including the gestation period, starting period and full swing period. This part elaborated specifically Guangzhou Municipal People's Government how to take the initiative,combined with the local actual condition at that time and made the final victory of the movement under the correct leadership of the Central Government and Central South Stratocracy Committee. Within 3 years, from 1949 to 1952, Guangzhou City launched the anti-drugs movement, arrested a large number of drug traffickers and seized a large number of opium and drugs, smited with a harsh blow to the the drug cartels, banned the opium and drugs and promoted the fundamental improvement of the social order which laid a good foundation to the socialist construction in Guangzhou. The final part summarizes the successful experience and limitations in the opium-forbidden and anti-drugs movement in the initial period of New China. At that time, Guangzhou Municipal People's Government attached great importance to this movement.Despite there were a multitude of things should been solved in the initial period of New China, they could still give full play to the subjective initiative with enthusiasm, and took a series of effective measures to ensure the victory of the movement, including the systematic anti-drugs policies, giving full play to the role of the people, resorting to flexible methods, and paying attention to associate with current affairs.

Governance movement has gradually becoming an international phenomenon of developed countries as Europe and the United States and many developing countries. China's urban management practice also reflects the varying degrees the characteristics of urban governance. And many different mode of urban governance have emerged in China. Hangzhou social compound agency, which is widely recognized as an advanced organizational structure to implement governance is a typical example of urban governance practice. This paper is established on the Polycentric urban governance theory and the public policy theory. First, we reviewed the development of urban governance theory, and meanwhile, reviewed China's urban governance theories. Second, we also give a summary of the different Governance indicators and analyzed the practice of governance of domestic and foreign cities. By the two aspects, we have come to the emerging polycentric governance structure and its characteristics. Third, this paper analyzed the characteristics of different kinds of social compound agency, and draws a governance schematic by draw from the polycentric governance structure. On this basis, we compared these two schematics, and defined the social compound as a feasible path to realize urban polycentric governance. Forth, polycentric governance is not only in the abstract field of urban governance, but also reflected in policy implementation, while the urban issuers are emerging. Polycentric mode of policy implementation reflects a lot of differences from the traditional single-center mode of policy implementation. Because of its actual role in policy implementation, Hangzhou social compound agency became a typical case of polycentric mode of policy implementation. Forth, Because of the effect of the policy implementation mode is inconclusive, this paper draw the method of policy evaluation like the ""Before after"" comparison method and ""control object test object"" comparison method to identify the performance of social compound agency as a policy implementation agency, and acknowledged advantages of polycentric policy implementation mode, and found the promotion value and Development potential of social compound",1873865761,,Dissertations & Theses," Sun, Yue YangSunYangYueSun, Yue Yang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318284451 , 111167922 , 189128 , 10542731 , 10542731", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873865761?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10542731 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+effect+of+the+policy+implementation+mode+and+the+urban+polycentric+governance+--for+the+example+of+hangzhou+social+compound+agency&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sun%2C+Yue+Yang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"425,A study on maupassant's stories in modern and contemporary chinese textbooks of middle school,"Translation from original language as provided by author Among foreign writers' works, Maupassant's works are of distinct representation with pithy and vivid words, short lengths, extensive ranges and thought-provoking contents, which reflect various kinds of thoughts and contradictions in capitalist society. What's more, the rather earlier translation enables his works appear quite early in textbooks, becoming the indispensable classic works in many textbooks. From the period of the republic of China till now, Maupassant has always been the classic writer in Chinese teaching textbooks, and his short stories, such as ""Two Friends"" and ""The Necklace"", have influenced successive generations of students. After the Revolution of 1911, foreign thoughts have more and more profound impact on China. Thereafter the needs of social transformation have imposed gradual translations of foreign works. Under the context, Maupassant's works was first translated into China in 1904. During the May 4th Movement, written language in China experienced a converting process from classical Chinese to vernacular, which is the inevitable result of Chinese social development and has brought huge influence on all aspects of Chinese society. In this process, textbooks have also experienced great changes from the classical style to the vernacular one. Maupassant works began pouring into the textbook. After 1949, along with the reformatory social situation, great transformation was also made in language teaching textbooks. Even so, Maupassant was still one of the crucial writers in Chinese teaching textbooks. The selection and interpretation of Maupassant's works also experience an evolutionary process in modern textbooks. This evolution is not only connected with the textbook development, but also closely related to social changes of China. At the very beginning, the ""Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies"" school interpreted his works as ""romantic, fantastic and bitter affairs""; then the attention was turned to the capitalist social human customers and social contradictions; finally, readers recognized ""Two Friends"" as an undisputed classic. Besides, the selective orientation of Maupassant's works is closely related to the Chinese social changes, which reflects the change processes of the principle contradictions from Chinese development of capitalism to the Anti-Japanese War. In current textbook, the original classic short story ""Two Friends"" fades out of sight, whereas the once supporting ones ""The Necklace"" and ""My uncle Jules"" took the place, all of which reflects the influence of social thoughts on textbooks. In turn, the article selection of textbook is concord with the thought trend of the social transformation. and plays a promoting role in the social transformation. As the trend of social thoughts changes, huge changes have took place in the selection and interpretation of Maupassant's works, which is particularly demonstrated in the dramatic change of interpreting ""The Necklace"". People initially interpreted it as reflecting ""small bourgeois vanity""; however, nowadays readers dig the multiple personalities of the characters and the sparking points of human nature. This change process underlies the process of Chinese social changes, whose motive to is so complex that it includes the international environment, contrast of comprehensive national strengths between China and western countries, national mentality, policies and regulations, educational policies, the Chinese teaching status, etc. Furthermore, the morphology of Maupassant's works in the textbooks before the liberation of China enlightens on the present education, and his works extensively inspire us in the perspectives of life meaning and writing method. In the new edition of PEP textbooks, ""The Necklace"" retreats from the compulsory textbooks, which brings teachers and students broader interpreting and thinking room, making Maupassant's works present its self-value and educational significance in a higher",1873866435,,Dissertations & Theses," Xing, Hong LiangXingLiangHongXing, Hong Liang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318322721 , 111167862 , 189128 , 10569284 , 10569284", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873866435?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10569284 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+maupassant%27s+stories+in+modern+and+contemporary+chinese+textbooks+of+middle+school&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xing%2C+Hong+Liang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"426,The study on the international participation of all-china women's federation,"Translation from original language as provided by author Women issue is not only the cry for women's equal rights and status made by scholars and feminists, it is also related to social condition, economic development, even the stability of a country. As what Hillary Rodham Clinton said in her speech on the Fourth World Conference on Women, the development of women concerns their families' progress, and ""when families flourish, communities and nations do as well"". Therefore, it is necessary to pay lasting attention to women issue. Currently, the international situation is undergoing profound changes. Civil society is rising globally. Transnational social movements obtain wider living space and more opportunities to develop. Within the contexts mentioned above, various women organizations participate in the process of international politics. All-China Women's Federation also enhances internatiaonal exchanges, seeking to speak out for her own on international stage. This thesis' theme is ""women's participation in international politics"", which is a descriptive study. There are three purposes of the study: (1) to research into dynamics mechanism of women's international participation by analysing the characristics of their participaition behaviors; (2) to discuss how All-China Women's Federation to deal with the new development of women's movement and the new changes of the world; (3) to explore development strategies that women's federation should employ in the international exchanges. Essentially, participation is a kind of behavior that some agents in a weak position try to influnce the mighty ones in a certain field. In the international society, state actors are the leading powers, while non-state actors are in the weak position, which is the reason that non-state actors are the main agents in the international participation. Women groups are active to get involved in the international politics, which is affinitive with globlization, united nations and the development of women movements. Women groups are various in kind, however, they mostly focus on low politics and need external support. Compared with women groups in other countries, All-China Women's Federation prefers to act in an orderly manner, and in accordance with government's foreign policies. These characteristics are developed in an unique historical and institutional enviorenment.

To mitigate climate change, the historic international agreements, ""United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"" and the ""Kyoto Protocol"" were reached to find out a solution to forestall the catastrophe, which capped the emissions of the main emitters, the industrialized countries, one by one. Held in Copenhagen in December 2009, COP 15 failed to win consensus support and did not reach the expectations of the ecumenical movement and the larger civil society. The idea of carbon tariffs gained momentum after the Copenhagen climate talks, becoming a critical problem in international climate change talks, political and economic negotiations. Legally, carbon tariff is imposed in violation of WTO principles of non-discrimination and market opening which makes it becomes an unreasonable trade restriction measure unfavorable to developing countries. However, environmental exceptions of WTO terms provide some reasonable basis for carbon tariffs. The future of carbon tariff depends on the strategic positioning of the developed countries, as well as the result of international climate negotiations. The pressure will be exist unless a mutually acceptable substantive agreement is finally reached. Based on global welfare analysis, a carbon tax and carbon tariffs partial equilibrium model is established, finding that there is a complete substitution effect between carbon tax and carbon tariffs; the higher of the carbon price in import country, the higher of global welfare; the higher of the carbon tax in export country, the lower of global welfare because of carbon tariffs. We could calculate an optimal carbon tariff via the ratio between the differences of carbon tax and externality in export country and that in import country. A carbon tariff static CGE model is constructed to analysis the impact of carbon tariff on macro-economy, trade and environment. We develop a macro-social accounting matrix (SAM) of ten sectors as the database of our CGE model based on 2007 Input-Output Table of China. GAMS Version 22.6 software is used to simulate the impact of carbon tariff from trade partners on China under four scenarios, which shows that carbon tariff has a slight negative effect on the national output and GDP, but a notable impact on energy requirements. On the basis of simulation of carbon tariff CGE model, we propose from five dimensions: institutions, sectors, technology, international cooperation, finance. To handle with carbon tariff levied by developed countries, what we need to do is trying to implementing industry upgrading, developing low-carbon technology and independent innovation capability, actively participating in international communication and cooperation, promoting low-carbon economy by financial tools and innovation, which are the strategic choices to actualize sustainable development of economy and",1874386633,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, JieWuJieWu, Jie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318635071 , 111163682 , 189128 , 10569551 , 10569551", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874386633?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAI10569551 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Economic+and+environmental+effect+of+carbon+tariff%3A+a+study+based+on+cge+model+simulation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Jie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"429,The influence of ownership structure on corporate social responsibility,"Translation from original language as provided by author As social and economic development and the rise of global social responsibility movement,the social responsibility has become more and more important,and corporate social responsibility has become a hot research academia.

Moreover, since 2008 our country has been released a series of documents on corporate social responsibility and made ""risk control ability"" as one of the business performance evaluation criteria of the managers in central enterprises. Managers as company strategic decision makers and management leaders play a vital role in the control of corporate social risk. An excellent management team will promote the company to actively fulfill their social responsibility and control corporate social risk to achieve the long-term development of the company.

Many historians are summarizing and introspecting why Japan succeeded while China failed? This topic is debated and discussed constantly in both China and Japan, even in the west. Studying the education reform of the Westernization Movement is of great significance to understand modern history of Chinese education. Studying the education reform of Meiji Restoration is an insurmountable panel point to understand Japanese education history. The significance of comparing the similarities and differences between education reform of Westernization Movement and Meiji Restoration in the process of modern social civilization, finding out the success and mistakes of the two sides is more important than merely making a research on the education reform of Westernization Movement or Meiji restoration's education reform. This is the starting point of why this article selects the education of Westernization Movement period and the Meiji Restoration period to make comparative study between the two countries. This paper is divided into five parts. The first part is a comparison of reform background. The three aspects: international environment, social conditions and education foundation are compared in this part. In the international environment, the pressure China got was far more intense than Japan got. In the aspect of social conditions, the intellectuals in two countries were eager to carry out a reform, but Japan's social condition was superior to China. In the aspect of education foundation, the degree of education development in Japan was higher than that in China. The second part is a comparison of the aim of reform. The aim of the two countries are both to save the country and make it rich and strong, but China's Westernization education only aimed at cultivating talents the Westernization business needed, mainly the translation talents and military technology talents, for the sake of maintaining the feudalist rule of the Qing Dynasty; while the nature of Japan's education reform of Meiji Restoration was bourgeoisie, the goal of which was to cultivate the people of a civilized nation and to construct a capitalist country. The third part is a comparison of the guiding ideology. Both countries paid attention to the succession of traditional culture and moral, but the guiding ideology of Westernization education was 'Chinese as the Fundamental Structure, Western for Practical Use', only studying the science and technology of the west. The education reform in the Meiji Restoration was the comprehensive learning from the western countries, following the guiding ideology, ""Japanese soul and foreign knowledge"", absorbing the thought, system and method of European and American advanced education extensively in order to achieve the goal of a civilization of reform. The fourth part is a comparison of reform measures. The Westernization education was to enlighten the bureaucracy not forming a national policy, only making progress in new-styled schools and programs of study abroad. The education reform in Meiji Restoration was carried out in the whole country with the national will and had relatively complete education legal system, establishing a modern education system and took the western education theory in depth, initially forming a Japanese education thought system. The fifth part is the conclusion, which summarizes the experience and lessons of Westernization Movement and Meiji Restoration in modern education reform and puts forward five suggestions to the current education reform: 1. The top design must be strengthened. 2 .The education reforms must be promoted together with other reforms.3. The strategic role of education for the developing countries catching up with advanced countries must be realized deeply. 4. The self-centered culture education must be abandoned. 5. Development of education should abide by the education law.

While in this systematic study object, the early study of this subject is not enough. And the point of this thesis is to study a part of this systematic subject in certain period that is the First Revolution period. I will give a general discussion concerned about the class theories which the CPC formed during the First Revolution period. First, in this paper, there will be a general demonstration about the main ideas formed by the CPC in that period. The related understanding and discussions about certain subjects in the revolution situation, as well as the resolution passed by the CPC committee could demonstrate the evolution process of the CPC's class theories in that historic situation. Second, in this paper, there will be a discussion about the factors which affected the class theories formed by the CPC in that period. During the First Revolution period, there were two main sources which affected the CPC in the understanding of China's social class problems, one is the theoretical element and the other is the CPC' practice experience in that period. As to the theoretical factors, the study and the understanding of Marxism by the pioneer CPC members is an important source. While in that period, under the special international situation, the Soviet Union revolution experience and the theories of Socialist revolution by Lenin have a more direct affection to CPC. On the other hand, not long after the foundation, the CPC has taken part in the revolution. During the process, the victory or the failure of the revolution is decided by the different classes of the society. By contracting and working with the different classes at that time, the experience gives the CPC a deeper acknowledgement of the characteristics of the classes. And the acknowledgments from both the revolution theories and the practice have a complicated relationship and they interact each other. Last, the paper analyzed the significance of the social class theories formed by CPC in that period. The immature class theories formed by CPC at that time is a basis of the future New Democratic Revolution Theory. Meantime, under the direct of these theories, the CPC achieved a lot in the development of Labor movement as well as the Peasant movement; and the CPC learned a lot in dealing the relationship with the bourgeois. On the other hand, the failures in the movement during the revolution period have disclosed that the CPC was still immature in the subject of the understanding of China's social classes and the lessons in the revolution period would be a treasure for the",1874969489,,Dissertations & Theses," Tan, HuanTanHuanTan, Huan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319380751 , 111160532 , 189128 , 10490970 , 10490970", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874969489?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAI10490970 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analysis+of+the+chinese+communist+party+social+class+theories+during+the+period+of+the+firt+civil+revolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tan%2C+Huan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"433,Great leap forward movement research in shaanxi province,"Translation from original language as provided by author From 1958 to 1960, the Communist Party continued criticism of 1956 of opposition to a risky policy incorrectly, which launched the large scale ""great leap forward"" campaign throughout the national territory with a global failure. As one of the largest provinces in Northwest of China, Shaanxi Province started the ""great leap forward"" campaign under the leadership of the Party Central Committee in 1958. The campaign was a very ""left"" movement of the line, and its range spread to agriculture, industry, science, education, health and other fields, eventually, Shaanxi's economic development had brought great losses. At present, the research of Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" campaign is still relatively weak and is not a system. So study for it in-depth, from which sum up experiences and learned, we can not only have a very important academic value and theoretical significance, but also have very important practical significance for this stage of development of socialist modernization construction in Shaanxi Province. Overall, this article is divided into six parts. The first part is introduction. This section mainly discusses the background and significance of the subject. Through the analysis of research status at home and abroad, the author takes a certain amount of research method so as to form their own way of research. The second part is about the age of launching Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"". This is primarily an analysis of both international and domestic reasons .That international reasons are mainly capitalism proposed rehabilitation and the Premier of the State of the US strategy and the domestic reasons are mainly social reason and opposition to a risky policy. The third part is the historical development of Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"" movement. The article considers the history of the development of Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" are in general consistent with the country, and it can be divided into four stages, which include the launching phase from November 1957 to April 1958, the climax stage from May to December in 1958, 1959 in stage of continuing leap stage, 1960 in the ""sick"" leap stage and terminates. The fourth part is the main contents and main features of Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"" movement. This part is on the basis of a thorough analysis of Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"" movement, in order to summarize it and come to the main character. Thinking of this article, Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" campaign is mainly in the areas of agriculture, industry and science as well as culture and public health. Agricultural aspects of the ""great leap forward"" mainly highlight the performance of water conservancy construction, satellite and high yield people's communization movement. Industries include all people making iron and steel movement and local industry sprouted. Culture and public health aspects of science and education, include literacy campaigns, health education, inter alia ""four pests"" and so on. The fifth part is about the serious consequences and lessons of Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" movement. Serious consequences are mainly in the economic imbalance in the national economy, lack of democracy in political; people should note on the economic objective laws of economic development, as well as on the construction of democratic politics.

In recent years, as the ""Sanlu milk powder"" incidence ,""Clenbuterol"" incidence, ""Foxconn Suicide Jumps"" incidence were exposed by medias ,more than ever, corporates are required to fulfill the increasing demands for social responsibility . No surprise that CSR has becoming a daily required Operating course for most corporate leaders. For corporates, the most important factor that troubles is whether it brings financial rewards if they put resources on CSR. Intrinsic motivation is generated only by ""profitable"" deeds. Theories and assumptions have already been proposed by foreign scholars, of which the most important is ""stakeholder theory"". The theory holds that corporates' responsibility should not only directed to their shareholders, but to its employees, governments, suppliers, consumers, communities and other relative groups. Based on this, the author propose the cost - benefit analysis of CSR. The conclusions of domestic and international study for the relationship between CSR and financial performance are not uniform, a very important reason is that the concept of corporate social responsibility is not clearly defined, resulting in a variety of measures of CSR. Because of its objectivity, Corporate Social Responsibility Index is considered a better measure of corporate social responsibility. In this paper ,the author choose Chinese Corporate Social Responsibility Index released by CASS as a measure of corporate social responsibility, and select the ""profit"" and ""basic earnings per share"" as a measure of corporate financial performance. Also select 95 listed companies and its two years data as samples of the study. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis are both employed for the study of the relationship. The study do not find a significant relationship between CSR and financial performance , the reason may be that stakeholders' return channels and mechanisms for CSR deeds have not been established in the context of our nation. The results also show that the relationships between sub-indices of corporate social responsibility and financial performance is not the same, and the relationship between corporate's commitment to ""social responsibility "" (namely the government's, employees' and community's responsibility) and financial performance is negative. The possible explanation is that corporates' social responsibility to these three groups constitute greater operating costs in the short term, and it is impossible for companies to translate these costs into financial performance. The results also show that firm size, corporate ownership play significant regulatory role between the relationship of corporate social responsibility and financial",1875041906,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, ChengZhangChengZhang, Cheng",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319481141 , 111164202 , 189128 , 10541111 , 10541111", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1875041906?accountid=14496, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics,, 0510 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAI10541111 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+the+relationship+between+corporate+social+responsibility+and+corporate+financial+performance+in+china&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Cheng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"436,At home in the world: Jawaharlal Nehru and global anti-imperialism,"This dissertation situates Indian nationalist politics in a broad, international context of anti-imperialist movements beginning in the late colonial and interwar period. The archival record is rich with sources on the international and transnational connections of the Indian National Congress (INC); however, scholarship on the independence movement almost exclusively concentrates on the micro-histories of ‘locality, province, and nation’ or the ‘subalterns’ of India. Instead, this project contributes a much-needed international perspective to Indian colonial history. As a case study, this dissertation traces the relationship between Jawaharlal Nehru, then a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement and later India’s first prime minister (1947–1964), and the League against Imperialism (LAI), a significant, yet little studied organization founded in Brussels in February 1927. The League offered a significant space for Nehru, and by extension the Indian National Congress, to interact and build partnerships with political leaders in other colonies, mandates and dependencies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; as well as North American and European social reformers concerned with working class and racial equality. A history of Nehru and his League connections underscores the significance of the international terrain in which Indian nationalists contested empire. In this project I argue that the making of Indian anti-colonial nationalism in the 1920s and 1930s emerged as a complex set of interactions on the ground in India, but also beyond the colonial borders of the subcontinent.",853292972,,Dissertations & Theses," Louro, Michele L.LouroL.MicheleLouro, Michele L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2274186841 , 58525481 , 66569 , 9781124465678 , 3440109 , 3440109", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124465678, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/853292972?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0332 History"," 0304 Biographies , 0332 History"," 0304 Biographies , 0332 History",," 0304 Biographies , 0332 History"," Biographies , History"," Social sciences , Anti-imperialism , Colonialism , India , Nationalism , Nehru, Jawaharlal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=At+home+in+the+world%3A+Jawaharlal+Nehru+and+global+anti-imperialism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Louro%2C+Michele+L.&amp;isbn=9781124465678&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"437,"From Marxist guerrillas to Rastafari warriors: The rise, fall, and reinvention of the National United Freedom Fighters","In this dissertation I argue that citizens' definitions of social justice, and their strategies for pursuing it, are structured by material and discursive conditions produced by specific state practices. In this study, based on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in the United States and Trinidad and Tobago, I explore this argument by examining the process by which the members of the National United Freedom Fighters (NUFF) initially resorted to violent political tactics and later abandoned them to adopt a state-sanctioned, self-funded “development” approach to their ongoing pursuit of social justice. The two different phases of the NUFF' social movement were led by the same actors, in the same impoverished region, with the same material development goals. Through comparative analysis of these two phases, and the material and discursive conditions characteristic of the two different historical moments in which they emerged, this study teases out the specific contextual variables that provoked the NUFF's initial commitment to and subsequent renunciation of violent political action. I argue that the transformation of the NUFF from a guerrilla force inspired by the promise of Marxist revolution into an NGO founded on principles of neoliberal subjectivity- self-help, participation in civil society, community-based volunteerism, market-oriented social reform, and spirituality (Rastafari)- was largely a consequence of material and discursive shifts produced by specific neoliberal governing practices instituted during and after the Structural Adjustment Program mandated by the International Monetary Fund in the mid-1980s.

In New York, my research focuses on the production, launch, and circulation of a United Nations shadow report on violence against indigenous women. In Belize, I contextualize indigenous women's experiences of gender violence within an indigenous movement to obtain collective land rights, a national women's movement, and national rhetoric on culture and gender. In both locales, I consider and compare: 1) how the “ethical” stance of NGOs shapes human rights activism; 2) how NGOs create visual and discursive “evidence” to represent violence and indigenous women's experiences; and 3) very real neoliberal state repression that immobilizes social movements for human rights and social justice. My concern is with the ways social movement NGOs struggle to maintain their feminist and social justice objectives as they interface with the demands of a transnational human rights system, and the strategies they use as they suffer from vilification, marginalization or mainstreaming, and lack of resources. Far from protective, human rights claims, explored here as “evidence,” often obscure both social inequalities and the response of state-level policies to these inequalities, especially for marginalized women.",853329855,,Dissertations & Theses," Uzwiak, Beth A.UzwiakA.BethUzwiak, Beth A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2274246041 , 58527611 , 66569 , 9781124466002 , 3440135 , 3440135", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124466002, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/853329855?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Activism , Ethics , Feminism , Gender violence , Human rights , Visual representation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mediating+gender+violence%3A+%E2%80%9CWitnessing+publics%2C%E2%80%9D+activism%2C+and+the+ethics+of+human+rights+claim+making&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Uzwiak%2C+Beth+A.&amp;isbn=9781124466002&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"439,The Dividing Line: Myth and Experience in Mexico's 1968 Student Movement,"My dissertation seeks to examine conceptions of the 1968 Mexican student movement—both academic and popular—in light of new sources. As a whole, the literature on 1968 focuses on the unique nature of the movement and its tragic end, yet with the result that the social, economic and political origins of the movement, and their specific global-historical context, remain obscured. Moreover, this scholarship has less to say concerning the specific modes of political organization which shaped the movement and linked it to other recent protests and strikes in postwar Mexico. Based on recently declassified state security documents, newspapers, memoirs, and interviews, my dissertation reconstructs the movement focusing on the daily behavior of the students, and reveals the scope and breadth of their activities, their interactions with other groups as well as agents of the state, and their use of city space. What emerges is a new understanding of how and why students protested. Students adeptly manipulated their urban environment, attempting to form alliances with workers, campesinos, and doctors. The city itself was an area of contestation in which state authorities and protestors confronted each other daily on the streets. By observing the interaction between students and state, I am able to show how a case was built for violence as a legitimate response. In this, the larger context of Cold War geopolitical competition frequently intruded into the government’s ability to comprehend what was in fact a largely national movement. Because 1968 is considered to have shaped the politics of a generation, I also examine the effects of the mobilization on political consciousness and identity. I examine the way in which university students become politicized, the meaning of student politics, and the frames through which students articulated their critique. What comes to light is more complete understanding of the types of consciousness which drove participation in the 1968 movement, as well as students’ relationship to political authority and to each other. While ultimately a national movement, these must be understood within the context of the 1960s, a period in which students mobilized around the world.",860332782,,Dissertations & Theses," Sanders, Sara KatherineSandersKatherineSaraSanders, Sara Katherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2312513931 , 60022601 , 66569 , 9781124538792 , 3445097 , 3445097", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124538792, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/860332782?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0520 Education history , 0733 Gender studies"," Latin American history , Education history , Gender studies"," Education , Social sciences , 1968 , Mexico , Movement , Protest , Student , Student movement , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Dividing+Line%3A+Myth+and+Experience+in+Mexico%27s+1968+Student+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sanders%2C+Sara+Katherine&amp;isbn=9781124538792&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"440,Multiple Discourses: The Mobilization of Trauma Narratives within Burma's Transnational Advocacy Network,"Since the 1988 uprising, a transnational advocacy network has formed around the issue of democracy and human rights in Burma. Within this transnational advocacy network, personal narratives of trauma have been promulgated in both international and oppositional news media and human rights reports. My thesis critically analyzes the use of the trauma narrative for advocacy purposes by the transnational advocacy network that has emerged around Burma and reveals the degree to which these narratives adhere to a Western, individualistic meta-narrative focused on political and civil liberties. Examining the “boomerang” pattern and the concept of marketability of movements, I highlight the characteristics of the 1988 uprising and subsequent opposition movement that attracted international interest. Reflecting on the psychological aspects of constructing trauma narratives, I then review the scholarship which links trauma narratives to social and human rights movements. Using a Foucauldian approach to discourse analysis, I subsequently explain my methodology in analyzing the personal narratives I have chosen. Beyond a theoretical discussion of trauma narratives and transnational advocacy networks, I analyze the use of personal narratives of activists involved in the 1988 uprising and the emergence of Aung San Suu Kyi's life story as a compelling narrative for Western audiences. I then explore the structure of human rights reports which situate personal narratives of trauma within the framework of international human rights law. I note the differences in the construction of traumatic narratives of agency and those of victimization. Finally, using Cyclone Nargis as a case study, I uncover the discursive divide between human rights and humanitarian actors and their use of personal narratives to support different discursive constructions of the aid effort in the aftermath of the cyclone. I conclude with an appeal to a more reflexive approach to advocacy work reliant on trauma narratives and highlight feminist methodologies that have been successful in bringing marginalized narratives to the center of human rights discussions.",864744156,,Dissertations & Theses," Bynum, Kate ElliottBynumElliottKateBynum, Kate Elliott",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2337234761 , 61014581 , 66569 , 9781124593784 , 1491205 , 1491205", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124593784, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/864744156?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," Asian Studies , Social research , Political science"," Social sciences , Burma , Cyclone Nargis , Human rights reports , Transnational advocacy networks , Trauma narratives",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Multiple+Discourses%3A+The+Mobilization+of+Trauma+Narratives+within+Burma%27s+Transnational+Advocacy+Network&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bynum%2C+Kate+Elliott&amp;isbn=9781124593784&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"441,Going away to find home: A comparative study of heritage/homeland tourism,"In this dissertation I explore the “homing desire” (Brah 1996:193) of American diasporas. I argue and show how identities are constructed as primordial. Specifically, I am interested in how homeland tourism, group tour experiences to ancestral homelands can be used as a “charter for new social projects” (Appadurai 1996:6) based around ancestral lands of origin and the qualities we associate with home. Therefore, this dissertation examines what happens when imagined communities (Anderson 1993) become briefly tangible. I present analysis of participant observation and interview data from three different American populations to examine the very real desire to belong to a meaningful and worthwhile group. I map how secular college-aged American Jews, middle-class African Americans and white families with adopted Chinese daughters shape and define the imagined community through the brief face-to-face experience of the group homeland tour. This dissertation takes the reader on tour, and analyzes the sites/sights of homeland travel, interactions between tourists, and interactions between tourists and homeland natives arguing that these experiences are consumed and interpreted to then define the individual and community’s place in the social world and in the process influence domestic experiences of otherness. Individuals engage with larger systems of organization that incorporate and implicate both the nation they reside within and the place they have chosen to visit, representing a distinctly Western and American path to imagined communities. While tourists look internationally to discover heritage and roots, I demonstrate how many expect and anticipate domestic changes and domestic acceptance of difference. In addition, tourism also facilitates global thinking, where homeland discoveries become examples of another sort of grounding in community, belonging to the cosmopolitan international global imagined. In all these examples of empowerment and the assumed benefits of homeland explorations, we see the American, the transnational, and the global intersecting. This dissertation teases apart the multiple forms of movement occurring simultaneously that represent our contemporary moment. Therefore, I argue that this desire for rootedness and comfort that comes with knowing one’s homeland reveals more about our contemporary moment and our individualistic approach to community consciousness than essential aspects of our identity and community. Homeland tours therefore provide Americans with experiences of international travel and a sense of global enlightenment, based not on heritage, but an understanding of global connectivity and power relations. Through a comparative examination of three different engagements with homeland tourism, I examine how individuals not only tell a story to themselves about themselves, but also speak to the larger world. This dissertation therefore is a journey itself, a journey to belonging and discovery of community.",866107823,,Dissertations & Theses," Powers, Jillian L.PowersL.JillianPowers, Jillian L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2344762311 , 61272221 , 66569 , 9781124611198 , 3453167 , 3453167", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124611198, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/866107823?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies , 0814 Recreation",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies , 0814 Recreation"," African American Studies , American studies , Black studies , Ethnic studies , Judaic studies , Recreation"," Social sciences , African-American , Chinese adoption , Diaspora , Heritage , Heritage tourism , Homeland tourism , Identity , Jewish American",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Going+away+to+find+home%3A+A+comparative+study+of+heritage%2Fhomeland+tourism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Powers%2C+Jillian+L.&amp;isbn=9781124611198&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"442,Persistent Revolutions in Colombia and Peru: A Comparative Analysis,"This thesis performs a comparative analysis of rural-based revolutionary movements in Latin America. The movements that are compared are the FARC, originating in Colombia, and the Shining Path, which emerged from the highlands of Peru. The comparison is meant to serve as a test for what variables are predictive of revolutionary success. Since these movements differ in their success in establishing permanent political, social and military movements in their countries over time, their dichotomous outcome can be used to point toward variables that warrant further consideration. Comparison of revolutionary movement makes sense in this case due to the similarities between the FARC and Shining Path, including geography, income distribution, historical political development and international context. However, the politics of these two countries contribute greatly to how these states adapt to their international environment and historical political development, providing a compelling point for analysis and explanation for the different scale of revolutionary success achieved.",867678791,,Dissertations & Theses," Huson, BrandonHusonBrandonHuson, Brandon",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2352255701 , 61526051 , 66569 , 9781124624884 , 1492011 , 1492011", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124624884, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/867678791?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science",," 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," Latin American history , Political science"," Social sciences , Colombia , FARC , Peru , Revolution , Shining path",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Persistent+Revolutions+in+Colombia+and+Peru%3A+A+Comparative+Analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huson%2C+Brandon&amp;isbn=9781124624884&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"443,Cultivating Aztlán: Chicano movement counterculture and the pluralist university,"The dissertation examines the Movement's close, if albeit complicated, relationship to the postwar American university, tracing the latter's impact on the formation of a widely influential counterculture among Chicano students, intellectuals, and artists. Combining archival study, close literary analysis, and political theory, I read a wide range of Chicano Movement documents, both canonical and non-canonical, in light of the period's contentious debates over the radicalization and redefinition of the new pluralist university. “I recognize [it] as academic,” Tomás Rivera says in 1978 of the Chicano Movement, a movimiento “which begins in the universities during the last years of the decade of the 1960s.” By the first half of the 1970s, nearly every prominent Chicano writer and poet held an academic position, and universities became the locus for the production, distribution, and consumption of Chicana/o identity and culture via aesthetic texts. My contention is that the political, intellectual, and cultural politics of the Movement largely coalesced within the walls of the university, a fact which carries important consequences for the development of Chicano radicalism, literature, and pedagogy. As Bill Readings observes, the post-1960s shift from Fordist to flexible, neoliberalized global regimes of capitalist accumulation divested the research university of its original social mission, namely to consolidate a unitary national culture and citizenry. Chicano counterculture, I argue, offered one set of coordinates with which to re-map the cultural center of the pluralist university and ultimately helped to translate Movement politics into terms readily exchangeable and consumable within academia and beyond. Despite serious reservations about U.S. higher education, el Movimiento eventually turned to the university in general and Chicano Studies in particular as the principal means by which to promote an emancipatory pedagogy and political practice based on a countercultural conception of Chicano tradition, community, and self-identity. “Cultivating Aztlán” explores the fateful ramifications of this commitment, and the ways in which the university ultimately sponsored a Chicano counterculture that held in abeyance the political, social, and class tensions perennially threatening to unsettle the Movement's precarious residence and aspirations in higher education.",868342600,,Dissertations & Theses," Lopez, DennisLopezDennisLopez, Dennis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2356457071 , 59269441 , 66569 , 9781124513676 , 3444227 , 3444227", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124513676, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/868342600?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American literature , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Chicana/o literature , Chicano movement , Postwar American literature , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultivating+Aztl%C3%A1n%3A+Chicano+movement+counterculture%0Aand+the+pluralist+university&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lopez%2C+Dennis&amp;isbn=9781124513676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"444,The international origins and popularization of eugenics,"Eugenics, the idea of selectively breeding the human race, found a large following in many nations in the late 19 th and early 20 th century. There were eugenic organizations in United States, Germany, England, France, Brazil, China, the USSR and many others. These organizations were deeply connected to each other in many ways. They formed an international movement which pushed for ""rational"" and selective breeding of human beings. The movement even had several international conferences and definable phases with commonalities in each nation. The first phase, 1865 to 1911, details the initial writings of Francis Galton. In a time of great social problems, brought on by the Industrial Revolution, Galton wrote about the need to breed fit human beings to help with England's growing pains. Galton's international peers wrote novels and articles trying to popularize eugenic ideals. The second phase, 1912 to 1920, saw the mass acceptance of eugenics in the scientific and academic community. Studies were done and shared to show the supposed certainty and necessity of eugenics. The third phase, the 1920s, found the institutionalization of eugenics in many governments. The final phase, the 1930s, saw eugenics as a popular cultural phenomenon. There were popular works, constant news stories and even classes taught about eugenics. This lasted until eugenics began to find an extreme proponent in Nazi Germany. Nazi eugenics and World War II forced many to question the theory and brought about a decline in eugenic followers. It is important to see the birth and popularization of eugenics as an international event to appreciate the true historical context for its existence and what came after.",868723512,,Dissertations & Theses," Lowenfeld, DanielLowenfeldDanielLowenfeld, Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2358664501 , 61011731 , 66569 , 9781124625478 , 3455263 , 3455263", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124625478, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/868723512?accountid=14496," 0582 Modern history , 0585 Science history"," 0582 Modern history , 0585 Science history"," 0582 Modern history , 0585 Science history",," 0582 Modern history , 0585 Science history"," Modern history , Science history"," Social sciences , Eugenics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+international+origins+and+popularization+of+eugenics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lowenfeld%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=9781124625478&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"445,"Privatizing Water: Globalization, States and Human Rights","This dissertation explores the transnational politics of water policy, specifically the debate over whether water should be treated as a commodity or a human right, and whether water services should be private or public. I explore this topic at two levels of analysis. At the level of global institutions and organizations, I analyze global governance on water by two sets of actors: the World Bank and its affiliated institutions and the transnational water justice movement. At the national level, I provide in-depth case studies of water privatization in Chile and the implementation of a human rights approach to water policy in Bolivia. I analyze the history of water reforms in these two countries, and evaluate the outcomes of water policy in terms of improvements in access to water services. Process tracing reveals a series of contextual factors that condition whether the human right to water can be fulfilled under private or public water services. I argue that neither approach alone – privatization or human rights – can improve access to water or fulfill the human right to water. I demonstrate that state capacity to govern the water sector in the public interest, including acting as en effective interlocutor between citizens and international financial actors, is key to improving access to water and fulfilling the human right to water, regardless of whether the water service is public or private. These findings expand existing frameworks for understanding how socioeconomic human rights are fulfilled in globalizing economies. Models of human rights fulfillment tend to only consider civil and political rights, provide a limited view of the state as a violator of rights, and focus too narrowly on legalization of socioeconomic rights. My research shows that fulfillment of socioeconomic rights requires more than improving justiciability of rights, and that strong state capacity is a key factor in fulfilling social and economic human rights. This research also challenges the neoliberal approach to water policy by showing that strong state interventions are necessary to improve access to water services.",869983133,,Dissertations & Theses," Baer, MadelineBaerMadelineBaer, Madeline",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2365328631 , 58994561 , 66569 , 9781124638119 , 3454444 , 3454444", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124638119, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/869983133?accountid=14496," 0595 Water Resource Management , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0595 Water Resource Management , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0595 Water Resource Management , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0595 Water Resource Management , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," Water Resource Management , International Relations , Political science"," Social sciences , Earth sciences , Globalization , Human rights , Privatization , Water policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privatizing+Water%3A+Globalization%2C+States+and+Human+Rights&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baer%2C+Madeline&amp;isbn=9781124638119&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"446,Social Regularities Influencing International Policy on Special Education: A Post-Structuralist Policy Analysis,"This study critically examines the social and educational movements from the 1980s to 2006 that led to the international special education policies set forth in five policy statements from a Disability Studies in Education perspective. I use critical policy analysis theories and methods based on the overlapping work of Foucault, Scheurich, and Ingram and Schneider that place policy in broad, cross-disciplinary, historical contexts that identify social, cultural, political, economic, and educational movements and conditions, i.e. social regularities, leading to the development of special education policies. From a poststructuralist, interpretivist paradigm, Scheurich uses metaphorical grids to excavate, identify, and study social regularities that define social problems and allow them to be visible, identified, and named, and policy solutions developed. Regularities are neither constant nor consistent. His methodology uses critical theory to examine and place policies, particularly education policies, in historical, cultural, political, economic and social contexts. Five international policies were analyzed: (a) the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; (b) The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education; (c) The World Declaration on Education for All; (d) The Convention on the Rights of the Child; and (e) the Organization of American States Declaration on the Decade of the Americas for the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities. Archival documents from the United Nations, Organization of American States, and numerous NGOs provided foundational background information on social movements and key factors in the development of the policies. Policies and archival documents were coded and data were analyzed to identify regularities and major themes in policies and in their development. Analyses identified primary regularities of human rights and social development in establishing education policy for persons with disabilities. The results of this study lay a foundation for future policy implementation studies related to special education policy and a deeper understanding of how past policies and language influence future policies. This nontraditional policy analysis strategy provides scholars and policymakers a new tool for understanding social problems, policy solutions, and their intersection with social and cultural factors that affect their success.",871104210,,Dissertations & Theses," Erratt, John DavidErrattDavidJohnErratt, John David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2370403171 , 62137081 , 66569 , 9781124649139 , 3454871 , 3454871", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124649139, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/871104210?accountid=14496," 0458 Education Policy , 0529 Special education , 0630 Public policy"," 0458 Education Policy , 0529 Special education , 0630 Public policy"," 0458 Education Policy , 0529 Special education , 0630 Public policy",," 0458 Education Policy , 0529 Special education , 0630 Public policy"," Education Policy , Special education , Public policy"," Education , Social sciences , Disability , Disability studies , International policy , Policy archaeology , Post-structuralism , Poststructuralism , Social regularities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+Regularities+Influencing+International+Policy+on+Special+Education%3A+A+Post-Structuralist+Policy+Analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Erratt%2C+John+David&amp;isbn=9781124649139&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"447,Globalizing Kenyan culture: &lt;i&gt;Jua kali&lt;/i&gt; and the transformation of contemporary Kenyan art: 1960–2010,"In an age of globalization, when as a result of enhanced telecommunication and global media, the world‘s population is more interconnected than ever, the public at large still tends to associate Africa with poverty, disease and political instability. Yet keen observers of the social landscape have observed that despite Africa‘s legacy of woes, cultural productivity in the region is on the rise, leading scholars to refer to the phenomenon as an African Renaissance. This is particularly the case in Kenya where a contemporary art movement is flourishing through both local and global art networks. But the question remains: how in the midst of poverty and political instability can there be so much cultural productivity? Based on field research involving participant observation and interviews with more than 200 artists and cultural workers in Kenya‘s capital city, I argue that it is due largely to an 'emergent cultural practice‘ given the Kiswahili term jua kali. By virtue of jua kali artists 'making do‘ with minimal resources and maximum ingenuity, imagination, originality and entrepreneurial acumen, they are creating new art forms or bricolage, the clearest evidence of which is what Kenyan artists call 'junk art‘; which is made from global garbage garnered from dump sites, then recycled into original artworks, and finally shown/sold in local and transnational art markets, thus reflecting global flows. This genre of contemporary Kenyan art defies stereotypical myths of ""tribal art"" and ""the primitive other.""

Their efforts led to new organizations, publications, conferences, and university programs, which constituted an intellectual movement with far-reaching influences. The emergence of post-WWII futurism is a multi-stranded history involving people with diverse motivations and backgrounds who aspired to revolutionize policymaking at all levels. Their efforts crossed national borders and often transcended Cold War divisions. Many futurists hailed from governmental, business, or scientific backgrounds and advocated for issues ranging from national economic planning boards, or ""future-consciousness"" at corporate levels of decision-making, to sustainable ecological practices. One of their many historical strands went back to the early Cold War years and the philosopher-mathematicians employed by the RAND Corporation. Given the sensitive forecasting challenges brought by Cold War unknowns, these architects of futurist methodologies believed they needed to devise better—more scientific—opinion technologies. Their search for improving the tools, such as the Delphi method, of future-minded decision-making continued into the 1960s and 1970s. While qualitative assessments still reigned supreme in the social sciences, quantitative analysis became increasingly important during the 1960s. Futurists used social, political, and economic indicators to study alternative futures and comment on their presents. These futures researchers prized the quantification of past and present values both for physical and social concepts. From these numbers, they aspired to clarify the future: how to predict and understand it, and ultimately how to change it for the better. Futurists cared about many things, not only about perfecting their methodologies or epistemic foundations, but also about addressing current, pragmatic, and popular issues. The desire to disseminate their ideas more widely and have their methodology gain greater influence compelled futurists to organize and formalize their field. The field's momentum slowed down by the 1980s as many critics disapproved of futurist methods and the deterministic, wishful, or simplistic outlooks that some futurists imagined. Although the movement in the United States was unique, other international case-studies developed in distinct yet comparable ways. Although futures researchers around the globe for centuries had enjoyed speculating about the future, this twentieth-century movement promised better predictions that were more systematic, detailed, controlled, quantitative, and expert.",874977018,,Dissertations & Theses," Tolon, KayaTolonKayaTolon, Kaya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2392248531 , 62812151 , 66569 , 9781124701233 , 3458336 , 3458336", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124701233, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/874977018?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0337 American history , 0578 History",," 0337 American history , 0578 History"," American history , History"," Social sciences , Cold War social sciences , Forecasting methodologies , Futures studies , Futurism , Futurists , Futurology , Opinion technologies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+American+futures+studies+movement+%281965%E2%80%931975%29%3B+its+roots%2C+motivations%2C+and+influences&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tolon%2C+Kaya&amp;isbn=9781124701233&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"449,Becoming and belonging: Transformation and citizenship in an international education setting,"Discourse in higher education in the 21 st century centers on the role of the institution in preparing post-secondary students for their place in modern society as well as its role in promoting social responsibility. Conversations around these perspectives help ""illuminate the totality of a university's activities and its relationships with the wider society"" (Barnett, 2005, p. 5). In response to the consequences of both globalization and market driven approaches to knowledge production, post-secondary institutions must grapple with ""the emergence of a new set of cognitive and social practices characterized by transdisciplinarity, heterogeneity, organizational diversity, and enhanced social accountability"" (Barnett, 2005, p. 14). Many argue that higher education worldwide has grown increasingly individualist and instrumentalist. At the same time, a counter movement appears to be emerging which advocates for reimaging post-secondary education as a transformative endeavor, implemented through collaborative frameworks; these offer promising possibilities for teaching and learning as well as for cultivating relationships in communities both local and global (Neave, 2000; Ninnes &amp; Hellstein, 2005; Trowler, 2008). This research study embraces this latter point of view, engaging in inquiry related to three primary constructs, international education, transformative learning, and civic identity. The study utilized a constructivist framework as a methodological approach for exploring the multidimensional components of a collaborative, cross-cultural teaching and learning consortium as a case. The findings led to the identification of transformative learning as a process of becoming and civic identity development as a process of belonging. In addition, from the analysis, a constructivist model for teaching, learning, and research emerged, contributing to the discourse which advocates for the awareness and assessment of transformative educational contexts.",875815823,,Dissertations & Theses," Intolubbe-Chmil, LorenIntolubbe-ChmilLorenIntolubbe-Chmil, Loren",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2395782761 , 62832151 , 66569 , 9781124704524 , 3459459 , 3459459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124704524, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/875815823?accountid=14496," 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education"," 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education"," 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education",," 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education"," Educational leadership , Higher education"," Education , Citizenship , International education , Transformational learning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Becoming+and+belonging%3A+Transformation+and+citizenship+in+an+international+education+setting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Intolubbe-Chmil%2C+Loren&amp;isbn=9781124704524&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"450,The rise and growth of AIDS NGOs in China,"This dissertation investigates the factors that give rise to and shape the development dynamics of AIDS non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in China. This study explains why grassroots NGOs, government-organized NGOs (GONGOs) and international NGOs grow in different trajectories, how AIDS NGOs mobilize resources and how different sources of resources influence the AIDS NGOs' dynamics and movement outcomes. Drawing on social movement theory, organizational theory and state-society relation theory, this dissertation argues that political opportunities and financial resources have a significant impact on grassroots AIDS NGOs‘ development in China, while financial resources and international pressure influence the development of GONGOs. Although financial resources are key to AIDS NGOs, the ability to secure financial resources varies widely among AIDS NGOs. Grassroots AIDS NGOs have more difficulty in accessing financial resources because of their lack of legal status, difficult relationship with the government, and local political environment. GONGOs are more likely to receive funding from the Chinese government and corporate grants. The study also finds that different sources of resources will impose different constraints on AIDS NGOs‘ development. Radical AIDS NGOs in China rely on foreign donors—in particular, those foreign foundations with a political orientation—and are more concentrated in the issue areas of policy advocacy and patient rights promotion, while moderate AIDS NGOs receive more resources from government-controlled funding, and are more concentrated in the field of AIDS care and treatment services. This dissertation draws on data from over 600 AIDS NGOs in China and over 30 in-depth interviews with AIDS NGO leaders in China.

My research explores Puerto Rico's independence movements on the island and the U.S. mainland with the intent to uncover how transnational influences in Puerto Ricans' social and economic lives may filter into their political activities. I look specifically at how the prolific use of cultural nationalism within the Puerto Rican political community contributes to the characterization of Puerto Rico as a transnational community, and I investigate how this affects their political activities. I conducted research for this dissertation between 2003 and 2005 in San Juan, Puerto Rico and New York City, New York. I used a variety of ethnographic methods, including semi-structured interviews, participation and observation, and archival research. I conclude that any transnational experiences Puerto Ricans may undergo in their daily experiences do not directly impact their political agendas and activities. Instead, I highlight each independentista community as distinct and illustrate the localized political goals and practices of both. I discuss the significance of spatiality to both pro-independence Puerto Rican communities, specifically as it relates to the traditional nation-state structure and the multiplicity of boundaries affecting national membership and access to citizenship and rights that it entails. Ultimately I argue that neither has the cultural eclipsed the political, nor has the transnational eclipsed the local, in Puerto Rican nationalist movements. Instead, I contend that the nation-state is still a powerful influence on contemporary definitions of national membership and belongingness, and locality and spatiality are significant motivators in today's sovereignty movements.",879629171,,Dissertations & Theses," Case Haub, Brandyce KayCase HaubKayBrandyceCase Haub, Brandyce Kay",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2409600591 , 63209771 , 66569 , 9781124741338 , 3461094 , 3461094", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124741338, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/879629171?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Political science , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Independence , Nationalism , Puerto Rico , Sovereignty , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Together+we+stand+apart%3A+Island+and+mainland+Puerto+Rican+independentistas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Case+Haub%2C+Brandyce+Kay&amp;isbn=9781124741338&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"452,"Institutional logics, collective actions and development of new technologies","Technology development is an outcome of collective social processes among actors in different institutional fields. In the literature on technology development, there have been long debates regarding whether technology shapes social structure and order, or whether social forces determine the developmental trajectories of technology. From a series of studies, I seek to understand the social dynamics of technology development in order to address theoretical tensions, both theoretically and empirically. Three separate yet related studies together provide a theoretical model and relevant empirical evidence for the linkages among actors, institutional logics and technologies. In Chapter 1 I first attempt to theorize about how actors, including scientists, engineers and technology users, collectively shape technological evolution in the general technology context. Combining the two perspectives—institutional logics and collective actions, I develop a theoretical model that addresses how scientists and engineers, faced with multiple institutional logics, strategically respond to the multiple institutional logics, and how the different formation of institutional logics can systematically lead to different types of technology development. In the theoretical model, I discuss four distinctive social mechanisms of framing institutional logics— replacing, patching, sequencing, and reinforcing , and the relationships between the social mechanisms and the types of technology development. In Chapter 2, building upon the theoretical model proposed in Chapter 1, I empirically investigate the emergence and decline of electric and hybrid drives in the community of electric vehicle researchers from 1969-2009. Combining the perspectives of institutional logics and social movements, I argue that an institutional logic is a product of collective social processes among actors in different institutional fields, and that established logics play an integral role in shaping the differential development of new technology. Empirical findings suggest that environmental protests and economic recessions systematically influence technologists' incorporation of two institutional logics (environmentalism vs. industrialism), and that social cohesion among actors within each institutional logic tends to shape differential developmental trajectories of electric and hybrid drives in the community of electric vehicle researchers. In Chapter 3 I further explore the process through which actors respond to multiple and conflicting institutional logics, suggesting that actors can purposefully create new concepts and meanings, modify meanings of institutional logics, or reinforce existing meanings. While existing institutional work has suggested and empirically demonstrated that institutional logics shape cognitive and behavioral patterns of actors, it still remains unanswered as to how actors can mobilize existing and new logics—differential decoupling processes. To trace the processes of constructing meanings of institutional logics, I conducted an inductive study by employing keyword-based, computer-aided text analysis of research proceedings published by the international Electric Vehicle Symposium in 1969 and in 1994. From the analysis, I identify four social mechanisms of logic construction: clarifying, patching, expanding and reinforcing. Moreover, empirical findings suggest that social mechanisms of patching, expanding and reinforcing are closely related to the emergence of hybrid drive.",879630454,,Dissertations & Theses," Jin, ByungchaeJinByungchaeJin, Byungchae",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2409601341 , 63210101 , 66569 , 9781124742564 , 3461165 , 3461165", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124742564, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/879630454?accountid=14496," 0454 Management , 0635 Organization Theory"," 0454 Management , 0635 Organization Theory"," 0454 Management , 0635 Organization Theory",," 0454 Management , 0635 Organization Theory"," Management , Organization Theory"," Social sciences , Collective action , Electric vehicles , Hybrid vehicle , Institutional logic , Social movement , Technological evolution",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Institutional+logics%2C+collective+actions+and+development+of+new+technologies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jin%2C+Byungchae&amp;isbn=9781124742564&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"453,The White Papers Mapping the Journeys of Antiracist White Educators,"We must dedicate our best efforts in teacher education to prepare a ninety percent majority of white educators to meet the needs of diverse students. As we simultaneously work toward a more representative teaching force, fundamental to this task is examining how antiracist white educators come to exist. The aim of this two-part research study was to examine the racial conceptualizations, teaching practices, and life experiences of white teachers, teacher educators, and scholar-activists who are committed to antiracism, culturally relevant pedagogy, and social justice. Critical race theory, critical white studies, and theories of culturally relevant pedagogy undergirded both studies. The first portion of this research followed a nominated sample of twelve white urban elementary school teachers. Those data uncovered that some dominant ideologies regarding whiteness, cultural deficit theory, and decontextualized racism can coexist even in the psyche of white teachers who strongly espouse and genuinely demonstrate commitments to antiracism and culturally relevant pedagogy. The second study examined the racial understandings of well-known white teacher educators and scholar-activists who are farther along in their trajectories toward antiracism. The findings indicated that antiracist white educators: (a) understand racism as foundational, institutional, and intersectional; (b) maintain that whites are mis-educated via Eurocentric curricula; and (c) firmly believe that whiteness serves only to dehumanize both people of color and whites. This cadre of scholar-activists cited duping and dissonance, racial devastation and separation, exemplars and efficacy, and subordinate-status relationships as origins of their antiracism. Participants also used conscientious co-optation, white proxyhood, and a keen understanding of ""privilege within privilege"" in their pedagogies with primarily white educators. These antiracist educators also revealed possibilities for transnational and global antiracist movements, that we might make significant headway in the selection, preparation, and professional learning of a majority white teaching force in education, and in the wider struggle for social justice writ large.",879759984,,Dissertations & Theses," Jackson, Taharee A.JacksonA.TahareeJackson, Taharee A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2410881961 , 63237671 , 66569 , 9781124766065 , 3461962 , 3461962", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124766065, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/879759984?accountid=14496," 0282 Bilingual education , 0530 Teacher education , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0530 Teacher education , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0530 Teacher education , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0282 Bilingual education , 0530 Teacher education , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Bilingual education , Teacher education , Ethnic studies"," Education , Social sciences , Antiracism , Antiracist activists , Antiracist white teachers , Antiracist whites , Critical race theory , Critical white studies , Culturally relevant pedagogy , White teacher educators , White teachers , Whiteness",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+White+Papers+Mapping+the+Journeys+of+Antiracist+White+Educators&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jackson%2C+Taharee+A.&amp;isbn=9781124766065&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"454,"Napalm, An American Biography","This dissertation offers a history of napalm from its invention in 1942 at Harvard University to President Barack Obama's signature on 21 January 2008 of the first U.S. treaty to limit its use.

The history traces this change in public opinion to media coverage during the Vietnam War that raised awareness of the weapon's effects on civilians; protests against the war and the Dow Chemical Corporation that started in 1965 and defined the gel as barbaric; U.S. defeat in Vietnam; commentary by opinion makers after the war, especially Hollywood film-makers; the rise of a global popular culture linked by electronic media; changes in international law; and development of alternative weapons.

The promotion of genetically modified (GM) crops and agrofuels following an industrial model, among others, is being part of the mainstream strategy to alleviate poverty and feed the world. Transnational agrarian movements such as the International Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP) and La Via Campesina have taken policy and political positions on these two controversial and highly debated issues. Their positions are different, yet often they are conflated in the policy, political and academic literature, explicitly and implicitly treating transnational agrarian movements as a monolithic bloc. Yet these two movements at least are highly differentiated based on social class origin, ideology and political standpoint.

This dissertation contributes to studies of globalization by highlighting the unintended consequences of neoliberalism in Argentina in the form of the collective empowerment of women in egalitarian social movements. The negative consequences of neoliberalism are well known, but I found that these policies produced more than misery. They also helped to stimulate a new kind of politics—a set of autonomous movements aimed at democratizing society as well as the state. In response to rapidly deteriorating living conditions, contemporary Argentine social movements organized their constituencies in what I have defined as the field of politics by other means. In the context of failed governmental programs and discourse designed to create docile, mobile subjects (governmentality), egalitarian social movements engaged in the creation of movements whose democratic structures contrasted with the dispossessing nature of the neoliberal global power they confronted. In Argentina, this new political culture and methodology fostered, through street theater and pageants, ‘other means’ of making politics, including a concern for internal gender democracy in what has been called the “solidarity economy.” My research suggests that struggles against gender inequities have a synergistic relationship to democratic political structures. I found that receptivity to feminist discourses and opportunities for women's participation were greater in anti-hierarchical opposition movements than in those with a more traditional leftist orientation. In these autonomous movements, women were able to challenge gender inequities, democratizing both the movements and their family relationships. Their struggle for democracy and freedom contrasts with the role of neoliberal policies and practices responsible for the weakening of democratic institutions in Argentina. In this way, my research not only broadens understanding of Argentina's crisis and recovery, but it raises questions about the implications of the present worldwide economic and social crisis on struggles to transform gender relations.",882900240,,Dissertations & Theses," Monteagudo, GracielaMonteagudoGracielaMonteagudo, Graciela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2422747631 , 63507651 , 66569 , 9781124767277 , 3465057 , 3465057", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124767277, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/882900240?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," Cultural anthropology , Social research , Womens studies , Latin American Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Argentina , Femininities and masculinities , Neoliberalism , Public anthropology , Social movements , Solidarity economy , Subjectivities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Politics+by+other+means%3A+Rhizomes+of+power+in+Argentina%27s+social+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Monteagudo%2C+Graciela&amp;isbn=9781124767277&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"457,"Freedom is Indivisible: The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Cold War Politics, and International Liberation Movements","This transnational history analyzes the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), its relationship with international liberation struggles, and the place of Cold War politics in defining civil rights from 1960 through the early 1970s. Most accounts of SNCC focus on the organization's grassroots work throughout the American South; on voter registration and nonviolent direct action; and on the organization's later turn to Black Power. Yet SNCC's April 1960 founding conference also emphasized solidarity with international struggles, and my work seeks to restore the organization's broad vision to scholarly attention. I place SNCC's creation within the context of worldwide decolonization movements and independence struggles, arguing that these international shifts were crucial to SNCC's formation. My project highlights the development of SNCC's Cold War critique of U.S. racial practices as part of the organization's push for civil and human rights. SNCC connected many of its activities in the American South – the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project, for example – with international ideas and movements, and with the potential of Cold War damage to the United States if the country did not create and enforce an America that reflected its proclaimed global values. My project also reveals how decolonization and African independence defined SNCC's domestic civil rights fight. SNCC sought inspiration and practical strategies from struggles in Ghana, Guinea, South Africa, and elsewhere, and I show how SNCC in turn served as a resource for political movements outside the United States. Even as members devoted great energy to domestic fights for political, social, and economic justice, SNCC also turned outward, connecting racial discrimination in the United States to the treatment of people of color throughout the world. SNCC leaders linked global transformations to changes in the United States, and its organizers and writers emphasized the parallels between domestic racism and colonialism abroad. By 1966, organization leaders called for a Third World alliance to unite black Americans with colonized Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans, forging a link between their own civil rights movement and international liberation struggles. Throughout the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, SNCC activists increased their identification with African liberation struggles and independence movements throughout the Third World, realizing the ""indivisible nature"" of the global struggles against racism, colonialism, and apartheid. By tracing the internal debates, public pronouncements, and changing organizing strategies that defined this leading civil rights organization, my dissertation fills a critical historical gap. Following scholars such as Mary Dudziak, James Meriwether, Brenda Gayle Plummer, and Penny Von Eschen, who have shown how international connections defined earlier civil rights efforts, and building upon pioneering histories of SNCC by Clayborne Carson and others, I argue that international currents proved critical to SNCC's fight for domestic civil rights and global human rights. My work is part of larger effort by a number of scholars, remapping the chronology and geography of one of the most profound moments in American history. An intellectual, social, and political history of a key decade in United States and world history, my dissertation contends that SNCC demanded social change within and beyond the borders of the United States, and that a better understanding of SNCC furthers the internationalization of U.S. history, and a new retelling of the Black freedom struggle.",884584356,,Dissertations & Theses," Wood, Julia ErinWoodErinJuliaWood, Julia Erin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2431564871 , 63674621 , 66569 , 9781124806822 , 3467852 , 3467852", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124806822, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884584356?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," African American Studies , American studies , Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Civil rights movement , Cold War , Decolonization , Human rights , Liberation movements , Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Freedom+is+Indivisible%3A+The+Student+Nonviolent+Coordinating+Committee+%28SNCC%29%2C+Cold+War+Politics%2C+and+International+Liberation+Movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wood%2C+Julia+Erin&amp;isbn=9781124806822&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"458,"United for a Better World: Internationalism in the U.S. Women's Movement, 1939–1964","Rooted in the networks of the Popular Front and the New Deal and galvanized by the horrors of total war, a women's internationalism blossomed in the United States in the middle of the twentieth century. Convinced that in an interconnected world, rights denied anywhere meant an end to peace everywhere, an interracial network of American women stretching from the center to the left of the political spectrum dedicated itself to achieving a lasting peace built on full democracy and international human rights. ""United for a Better World"" traces the ascent of this women's internationalism in World War II and how it changed and continued during the Cold War and the domestic red scare. Well before the advent of ""global feminism"" (usually dated to the 1970s) and the rallying cry ""women's rights are human rights,"" women activists played a crucial but understudied role in defining the ideology of human rights and securing its inclusion in the United Nations Charter. In the transnational spaces and international mindset they developed, this network of women struggled to include issues of sex, race, and class within a broader framework of supranational human rights. In the process, they laid the groundwork for international recognition of women's rights and women themselves as legitimate international actors. The United Nations provided women with inspiration, language, and an institutional home for their labor, peace, anti-colonial, and women's rights activism. Denied access to the traditional paths of career advancement, women used their own networks and organizations –such as the American Association of University Women, National Council of Negro Women, and the League of Women Voters– to catapult themselves into influential positions of international affairs. Activists' responses to the internationalism of the 1940s and their decisions when the domestic political terrain narrowed reveal the complicated links among different levels of engagement –the local, national, transnational, and international. When domestic repression fostered dissension and curtailed domestic activism, women's internationalism splintered, but it did not disappear. For some women, the UN offered a venue beyond national boundaries where they could continue to practice a progressive internationalism. For others, the ideological battles of the Cold War provided a platform to propagate an American-centric women's internationalism under the sponsorship of the U.S. State Department. The cost of this division reverberated for the next three decades. The roots of global feminism and its much-debated relationship with non-governmental organizations grew directly from the choices activists made during and after World War II. Often unknowingly, the feminists of the 1960s and 1970s built their movements on the landscape cultivated by their predecessors in the 1940s and the early years of the Cold War. Ultimately, this project argues that events and ideas within the international and transnational spheres powerfully and systematically changed the trajectory of American social movements in the second half of the twentieth century.",884594929,,Dissertations & Theses," Leslie, Grace VictoriaLeslieVictoriaGraceLeslie, Grace Victoria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2431564881 , 63674621 , 66569 , 9781124807140 , 3467511 , 3467511", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124807140, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884594929?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," African American Studies , Black history , American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , African-American , Internationalism , U.S. in the world , U.S. social activism , U.S. women's history , United Nations , United States , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=United+for+a+Better+World%3A+Internationalism+in+the+U.S.+Women%27s+Movement%2C+1939%E2%80%931964&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leslie%2C+Grace+Victoria&amp;isbn=9781124807140&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"459,Performing Redress: Military Sexual Slavery and the Transpacific Politics of Memory,"Performing Redress: Military Sexual Slavery and the Transpacific Politics of Memory is a transnational cultural study of political and artistic work relating to the social movement for redress among survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery. This institutionalized system of sexual slavery forever transformed the lives of an estimated 200,000 Asian girls and young women who were coerced into servicing Japanese troops (1932-1945). For fifty years, survivors kept their wartime experience a secret, but since the early 1990s activists have begun advocating on their behalf and shedding light on their history. From violence and silencing, a vibrant culture of activism and artistic intervention has emerged. This dissertation looks at how survivors, activists and artists utilize performances—embodied practices ranging from protests, tribunals, theatre and dance to testimonial acts—to stage their claims for redress in response to a marginalized and state-suppressed history. These performances are not disparate events, I argue, but part of a transpacific genealogy of redressive acts that create space for restoration outside of state parameters. Performing Redress captures a process-oriented theory of redress which encompasses epistemological, social and political change experienced in the here and now of live performance. My transnational interdisciplinary methodology draws from cultural, performance and feminist theory and involves archival research, interviews and participant-observation in Korea, Japan and the United States. The dissertation follows international collaboration among activists alongside the global movement of performance practices. Each chapter focuses on a modality of performance in a particular location, while illustrating transnational connections through the production and/or circulation of the performance. A performance studies approach focuses analytical attention on questions of embodiment, liveness and audience as elements crucial to the operation of redressive acts. Redressive acts engage multiple audiences, allowing individuals and communities to join in negotiating traumatic histories and enacting social restitution. At the nexus of American studies, Asian American studies, performance studies, and gender and sexuality studies, this dissertation offers ways of re-imagining predominantly legal and political understandings of redress and cultural transmission in relation to Asian diasporic communities. It also investigates the relationship between memory and history, particularly how women's performances attend to gaps in historical archives and national narratives.",884629179,,Dissertations & Theses," Son, Elizabeth Won-KyungSonWon-KyungElizabethSon, Elizabeth Won-Kyung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2431734911 , 63691061 , 66569 , 9781124806617 , 3467840 , 3467840", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124806617, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884629179?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts"," American studies , Asian Studies , Womens studies , Theater , Performing Arts"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Comfort women , Japan , Memory , Performance studies , Redress , Sexual slavery , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performing+Redress%3A+Military+Sexual+Slavery+and+the+Transpacific+Politics+of+Memory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Son%2C+Elizabeth+Won-Kyung&amp;isbn=9781124806617&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"460,The politics of language policy in Morocco: The 2003 Berber language initiative,"In 2003, for the first time in contemporary Moroccan history, Berber, the mother tongue of over 40 percent of the population, was officially taught in a limited number of Moroccan public primary schools. The 2003 Berber language initiative that opened Moroccan schools to the teaching of Berber reignited national and transnational debates about language policy in Morocco. This research examines the politics ofthe 2003 Berber language initiative. This research examines language policy, policy processes, and outcomes of current language policies in Morocco. Far too often language policy is seen by policy planners as a top-down process that is uncontested, uniform, and confined to the arena of schooling. This project examines and challenges the idea that language policy is significant only in the confines of classrooms. This project gathers evidence to address such an idea. It draws on information generated through interviews with policy makers, curriculum writers, education officials, activists, donors, youth, and teachers. Specifically, this project asks and addresses the questions: Who are the interested actors and groups in Moroccan language programming? What are these groups' specific interests, and how do such groups advance and implement their projects? This project addresses these questions by situating research within the Berber community at-large and, specifically, within several components of the community and Berber rights movement, including: mainstream Berber elite, popular class Berbers/Moroccans, and counter-movements within and across these groups, whose main identity is Berber. The Berber political and cultural movement is examined from the year 2003 to the present including various levels of the community's competing, conflicting, and overlapping interests. Ultimately, these interests or discourses are analyzed in relation to broader social, economic, and political issues, which help illuminate what is going on inside the Berber movement in Morocco.",885156521,,Dissertations & Theses," Todd, Jeremy A.ToddA.JeremyTodd, Jeremy A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2434961721 , 63816551 , 66569 , 9781124830681 , 3471384 , 3471384", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124830681, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885156521?accountid=14496," 0279 Language arts , 0331 African history , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," 0279 Language arts , 0331 African history , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," 0279 Language arts , 0331 African history , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language",," 0279 Language arts , 0331 African history , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," Language arts , African history , North African Studies , Language , Language policy , Initiatives , Morocco"," Education , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Amazigh , Berber , Education , Language policy , Morocco",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+language+policy+in+Morocco%3A+The+2003+Berber+language+initiative&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Todd%2C+Jeremy+A.&amp;isbn=9781124830681&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"461,"Peasants, firms, and activists in the struggle over gold mining in Guatemala: Shifting landscapes of extraction and resistance","Over the past two decades, the rise of small exploration companies and the movement of investment capital in mineral exploration into new regions of the developing world have transformed the global gold mining industry. At the same time, mineral conflicts in peasant host communities are on the rise. This dissertation seeks to understand this resistance as a function of new dynamics of social configurations between mining firms, anti-mining activist networks, and the host community under late neoliberal globalization. Central America exemplifies these new investment and extraction trends in gold. Mineral exploration has grown by 1,000 percent in Guatemala since the 1990s, bringing about an active and broad-based opposition movement. Drawing from the cases of Guatemala and El Salvador, I explore resistance and acquiescence to gold mining with a wide lens. Using original interview and survey data. I weave together discussions of identity politics, global indigenous rights norms, mineral geology, and land tenure, among other concepts, to illuminate the social dynamics of mining conflicts in Guatemala, and by extension, the neoliberalization of nature writ large. Resistance to Guatemala's mineral-led development project stems from a complex amalgam of cognitive and emotional responses on the part of host community residents to land tenure insecurity and the entrepreneurial behaviors of the anti-mining activist network, all of which is underpinned by the aggressiveness of new gold mining. The substantive chapters of this dissertation deal with these issues individually. The first chapter examines the global gold mining industry and theorizes the industrial transformations of the past two decades. The second chapter critiques the role of activist networks in organizing against mining in the context of a municipal referendum to exercise Mayan peasants' right to free, prior and informed consent. The third chapter develops the concept of the global indigenous rights regime to illuminate the processes of discursive production of indigenous identity by the different stakeholders involved in the public debate around mining in Guatemala. The fourth and final chapter explores differential peasant responses to mining and argues that the social meaning of land shapes peasants' rejection and acceptance of mining in their territories.",885366701,,Dissertations & Theses," Dougherty, Michael L.DoughertyL.MichaelDougherty, Michael L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2435954181 , 63840011 , 66569 , 9781124825199 , 3471481 , 3471481", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124825199, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885366701?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0501 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0501 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0501 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Economics , Latin American Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Guatemala , Identity politics , Indigenous rights , Land tenure , Mining industry , Neoliberalization , Tectitan, Huehuetenango",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Peasants%2C+firms%2C+and+activists+in+the+struggle+over+gold+mining+in+Guatemala%3A+Shifting+landscapes+of+extraction+and+resistance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dougherty%2C+Michael+L.&amp;isbn=9781124825199&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"462,The sex worker rights movement in Canada: Challenging the ‘prostitution laws’,"The contemporary movement for sex workers' rights organizes around a range of international, national, and localized grievances. They are unified in their efforts to promote and protect sex workers' human and labour rights through the decriminalization and destigmatization of sex industry work. Within the context of social movement theory, literature on the sex worker rights movement has mainly focused on its failure to mobilize due to inadequate resources, small membership base, lack of sex worker leadership and absence of influential allies. In 2007, sex workers in Toronto, Ontario and in Vancouver, British Columbia, launched constitutional challenges to their respective Provincial Superior Courts to strike down Criminal Code of Canada provisions related to adult prostitution. The two court challenges are contrary to what would be predicted based on the extant literature on the sex worker rights movement. That literature supports a conclusion that due to marginalization, ambivalence toward their work, and feelings of inadequacy as political actors, sex workers lack the material and organizational strength to impact state regulation and alter social perceptions of sex work. This dissertation was based on a multi-site ethnographic study examining the processes by which constitutional challenges were initiated, the role of sex workers, and how the cases were perceived by the larger movement of sex worker rights activists in Canada. Drawing on primary and secondary data sources, including interviews with 26 movement activists, I examined constitutional litigation from the perspective of social movement theory, specifically considering the political opportunities, alliances, and resources necessary for these challenges to take place. This research demonstrates some tangible successes for the sex worker rights movement in Canada, despite ongoing social movement obstacles. The history of sex worker rights activism in Canada has produced sex worker-run organizations and political coalitions. These have garnered support from other organizations, researchers, cause lawyers and their teams, making it possible for sex workers, as individuals and via organizations, to mobilize legally against federal prostitution laws.",885427348,,Dissertations & Theses," Beer, SarahBeerSarahBeer, Sarah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2436141531 , 63845351 , 66569 , 9780494795279 , NR79527 , NR79527", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494795279, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885427348?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0733 Gender studies",," 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0733 Gender studies"," Political science , Sociology , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Decriminalization , Prostitution laws , Sex worker rights movement , Stigmatization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sex+worker+rights+movement+in+Canada%3A+Challenging+the+%E2%80%98prostitution+laws%E2%80%99&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Beer%2C+Sarah&amp;isbn=9780494795279&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"463,"Hearing the hurricane coming: Storytelling, second-line knowledges, and the struggle for democracy in New Orleans","From the BLKARTSOUTH literary collective in the 1970s, to public-storytelling-based education and performance forms in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and fiction and nonfiction collections in the years since the storm, this study traces how New Orleans authors, playwrights, educators, and digital media makers concerned with social justice have mirrored the aesthetics and epistemologies of the collaborative African diasporic expressive traditions that began in the antebellum space of Congo Square and continue in the traditions of second-line parading and Mardi Gras Indian performances today. Combining literary analysis, democratic and performance theory, and critical geography with interviews and participant observation, I show how New Orleans authors, theatre makers, and teachers have drawn on ""second-line"" knowledges and geographies to encourage urban residents to recognize each other as ""divided subjects"" whose very divisions are the key to keeping our social and political systems from stabilizing and fixing borders and ethics in a way that shuts down possibilities for dissent, flux, and movement. Building on diverse scholarly arguments that make a case both for New Orleans's exceptionalism and its position, especially in recent years, as a model for neoliberal urban reform, this study also shows how the call and response aesthetics of community-based artists in New Orleans have influenced and benefited from the rise of global democratic performance and media forms. This dual focus on local cultures of resistance and New Orleans's role in the production of national and transnational social justice movements enables me to evaluate New Orleans's enduring central role in the production of U.S. and transnational constructs of African diasporic identity and radical democratic politics and aesthetics. Chapter One, ""Second Line Knowledges and the Re-Spatialization of Resistance in New Orleans,"" synthesizes academic and grassroots analyses and descriptions of second lines, Mardi Gras Indian performances, and related practices in New Orleans through the lenses of critical geography and democratic theory to analyze the democratic dreams and blues approaches to history and geography that have been expressed in dynamic ways in the public spaces of New Orleans since the era of Congo Square. My second chapter, ""'We Are Black Mind Jockeys': Tom Dent, The Free Southern Theater, and the Search for a Second Line Literary Aesthetic,"" explores the unique encounter in New Orleans between the city's working-class African American cultural traditions and the national Black Arts movement. I argue that poet and activist Tom Dent's interest in black working-class cultural traditions in New Orleans allowed him to use his three-year directorship of the Free Southern Theater to produce new and lasting interconnections between African American street performances and African American theatre and literature in the city. Chapter Three, ""Story Circles, Educational Resistance, and the Students at the Center Program Before and After Hurricane Katrina,"" outlines how Students at the Center (SAC), a writing and digital media program in the New Orleans public schools, worked in the years just before Hurricane Katrina to re-make public schools as places that facilitated the collaborative sounding and expression of second-line knowledges and geographies and engaged youth and families in dis-privileged local neighborhoods in generating new democratic visions for the city. This chapter contrasts SAC's pre-Katrina work with their post-Katrina struggles to reformulate their philosophies in the face of the privatization of New Orleans's public schools in order to highlight the role that educational organizing in New Orleans has played in rising conversations throughout the US about the impact of neo-liberal school reform on urban social formations, public memory, and possibilities for organized resistance. Chapter Four, ""'Running and Jumping to Join the Parade': Race and Gender in Post-Katrina Second Line Literature"" shows how authors during the post-Katrina crisis era sought to manipulate mass market publication methods in order to critically reflect on, advocate for, and spread second-line knowledges. My analysis of the fiction of Tom Piazza and Mike Molina, the non-fiction work of Dan Baum, and the grassroots publications of the Neighborhood Story Project asks how these authors' divergent interrogations of the novel and non-fiction book forms with the form of the second line parade enable them to question, with varying degrees of success, the role of white patriarchy on shaping prevailing media and literary forms for imagining and narrating the city. Finally, Chapter Five, ""Cross-Racial Storytelling and Second-Line Theatre Making After the Deluge,"" analyzes how New Orleans's community-based theatre makers have drawn on second-line knowledges and geographies to build a theatre-based racial healing movement in the post-Katrina city. Because they were unable and unwilling, after the Flood, to continue to ""do"" theatre in privatized sites removed from the lives and daily spatial practices of local residents, the network of theater companies and community centers whose work I describe (such as John O'Neal's Junebug Productions, Mondo Bizarro Productions, ArtSpot Productions, and the Ashé Cultural Arts Center) have made New Orleans's theatrical landscape into a central site for trans-national scholarly and practitioner dialogues about the relationship of community-engaged theatre making to the construction of just and sustainable urban democracies.",885430404,,Dissertations & Theses," Michna, CatherineMichnaCatherineMichna, Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2436164361 , 63846281 , 66569 , 9781124804774 , 3466775 , 3466775", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124804774, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885430404?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0591 American literature"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0591 American literature"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0591 American literature",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0591 American literature"," African American Studies , American studies , Black studies , Multimedia Communications , American literature"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Black Arts Movement , Blues and jazz histories , Louisiana , New Orleans , Performance studies , Radical democracy , Social justice , Social justice movements , Storytelling , Urban literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hearing+the+hurricane+coming%3A+Storytelling%2C+second-line+knowledges%2C+and+the+struggle+for+democracy+in+New+Orleans&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Michna%2C+Catherine&amp;isbn=9781124804774&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"464,"Gendering Nations of Consumers: Migration and Commerce between Italy, the U.S., and Argentina, 1880 to 1940","My dissertation explores how Italian merchants and the products they sold to consumers in Italy, in the U.S., and in Argentina transformed consumer practices and gendered national identities in all three countries between 1880 and 1940. The emigration of 27 million Italians created networks of trade in Italian products between Italy and the Americas during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The U.S. and Argentina were the two most popular overseas destinations for Italians; between 1880 and 1930 over four million Italians migrated to the U.S. and over two million migrated to Argentina. Like many economic historians today, late nineteenth centuries liberal rulers pointed to natural laws of supply and demand to explain global linkages of trade and migration. I instead adopt a cultural economy approach that considers the ways culture organizes economic activity to analyze how changing understandings of gender, nationality, and ethnicity shaped and reflected migrants' consumer experiences. Few scholars have explored historic connections between the global circulation of migrants and consumer markets. Historians of migration have focused on the movement of people rather than on commerce, while work on global commodity chains concentrates on the contemporary political economy, while overlooking the social and cultural roles of migrants in shaping commercial flows. I combine the methods of social and cultural history to explore the development of commodity and migratory chains, and to analyze changing understandings of gender, nationality, and ethnicity embedded in such networks. By employing multiple scales of analysis—transnational, comparative, and triangular—I illustrate how transatlantic linkages and nation- and hemispheric—specific processes influenced the development of migrants' consumer identities and habits. Using a transnational perspective, I describe Italian liberal elites' attempts to integrate Italian migrant consumers into their larger nation and empire building projects at the turn of the twentieth century and explain why diplomatic plans could not neatly synch with migrants' everyday strategies in transnational family economies. I also explore change over time in gendered representations of the Italian nation in export advertisements, and how such commercial iconography connected Italian communities in the U.S. and Argentina to each other and to Italy. I also, however, compare how ties between Italian migration and commerce manifested differently in the U.S. and Argentina, using debates, advertisements, and products in the migrant press to show the various ways Italians abroad managed trade and consumption in and from their host countries. I also employ a triangular or hemispheric lens to investigate how U.S. cultural and economic expansion into Latin America connected Italian consumers in the U.S. and Argentina. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of gender in organizing transnational linkages between trade and migration. I argue that Italian migrant women became more valued as real and symbolic purchasers of Italian products, especially during and after WWI when the Great Depression, restrictive immigration laws, and rising nationalisms globally reduced actual transatlantic flows. As symbols through which migrants in the U.S. and Argentina formed national and consumer identities, female Italian migrants were offered new, if ambiguous, roles in the ""imagined community"" of their respective host countries and in Italy's plans for a global empire.",885876277,,Dissertations & Theses," Zanoni, Elizabeth AnnZanoniAnnElizabethZanoni, Elizabeth Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2438712411 , 58807901 , 66569 , 9781124809823 , 3464622 , 3464622", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124809823, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885876277?accountid=14496, 0582 Modern history, 0582 Modern history, 0582 Modern history,, 0582 Modern history, Modern history," Social sciences , Argentina , Immigration , Italy , Trade , Transnational , Transnational trade , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendering+Nations+of+Consumers%3A+Migration+and+Commerce+between+Italy%2C+the+U.S.%2C+and+Argentina%2C+1880+to+1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zanoni%2C+Elizabeth+Ann&amp;isbn=9781124809823&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"465,Battling Imperialism: Revolutionary Hip Hop in the Americas,"In Battling Imperialism: Revolutionary Hip Hop in the Americas I examine how revolutionary hip hop in the Americas works as a transnational movement of cultural, national, and insurgent expression. I use the term revolutionary hip hop to point to hip hop music and culture that explicitly works to implement social and structural change. This is also music that utilizes the four elements of hip hop in order to disseminate political messages about diverse struggles for equality. I argue that transnational movement(s) of revolutionary hip hop and culture constantly emerge anew denying any assertion of cultural and national absolutism because as hip hop travels it is often adapted to fit a particular geopolitical context where national history, struggles of the present, and possibilities of differentiated futures work to challenge cultural imperialism. I extend this argument by showing how a range of different revolutionary hip hop productions—productions that speak to the everyday realities of the people—incite longings for social and political change because they are formed at the temporal and spatial convergences of the nation. I specifically trace the transnational routes of revolutionary hip hop that traverse Cuba, Venezuela, and Indigenous communities in the United States and how these forms of hip hop produce critiques regarding the production and consumption of U.S. cultural imperialism in addition to addressing issues of national citizenship and national politics. Moreover, I situate the complexities of revolutionary hip hop productions within a feminist context that interrogates the possibilities for these productions to challenge heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, and imperialism; and, I propose that these cultural formations should not be understood as a privileged hegemonic model of resistance. Instead, I understand these revolutionary hip hop productions as varied forms of resistance fraught with layers of history and contingent struggle by wrestling with two driving questions: How do we form transnational communities of resistance without reproducing cultural hegemony? And, while hip hop seems to translate as a viable medium of resistance across the Americas, why do many of the revolutionary hip hop productions that resist imperialism, racism, and economic inequity, often still rely on the reproduction of misogyny?",886421578,,Dissertations & Theses," Navarro, Jenell RaeNavarroRaeJenellNavarro, Jenell Rae",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2439493011 , 63763301 , 66569 , 9781124808918 , 3466979 , 3466979", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124808918, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/886421578?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0323 American studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0323 American studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0323 American studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0740 Native American studies"," American studies , Latin American Studies , Ethnic studies , Gender studies , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Feminism , Hip hop , Imperialism , Indigenous peoples",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Battling+Imperialism%3A+Revolutionary+Hip+Hop+in+the+Americas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Navarro%2C+Jenell+Rae&amp;isbn=9781124808918&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"466,The World Social Forum: An exploration of the movement through an alternative development lens,"Mainstream and alternative approaches to development exist on opposite ends of the development spectrum. Mainstream development has long concerned itself with one primary goal: economic growth. Neo-liberal organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank claim to be genuinely concerned for the world's poorest nations, yet these claims are, time and time again, defied by adverse actions. Development strategies are proposed and implemented at the cost of human dignity and, in extreme cases, at the cost of human life. The alternative development movement acknowledges that economic growth is a necessary component of development but it is just one factor among a myriad of other factors. Human development, rather than economic growth, is the ultimate concern. Despite their enormous differences, alternative development would not exist without mainstream development. This thesis explores the World Social Forum (WSF) as a concrete expression of alternative development. The WSF, established in 2001, is a multi-country movement which encourages open and inclusive participation. Members seek the creation of an alternative world through networking, the collective work of social movements and social cohesion. Initially, I examined the differences between alternative and mainstream development. The main pillars of both approaches to development were established. Following this, a qualitative content analysis was performed on thirty-eight documents, divided into four recognizable categories and published by the WSF, to determine over-arching themes. The themes from the documents were considered in relation to the pillars of alternative development to determine if and how the WSF is a concrete expression of alternative development. WSF participants believe that their discussions, actions, campaigns and networking will lead to the realization of another possible world. The many themes and sub-themes emerging from its documents and uncovered during this research process speak to the WSF's important role in the search for alternatives.",887891829,,Dissertations & Theses," Corbeil, Jessica RosineCorbeilRosineJessicaCorbeil, Jessica Rosine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2444961001 , 64025951 , 66569 , 9780494798607 , MR79860 , MR79860", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494798607, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/887891829?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure",," 0601 International Relations , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," International Relations , Public policy , Social structure", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+World+Social+Forum%3A+An+exploration+of+the+movement+through+an+alternative+development+lens&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Corbeil%2C+Jessica+Rosine&amp;isbn=9780494798607&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"467,Slow food: A globalized social movement with an anti-globalization mission,"This research utilized the Slow Food Movement (SFM) as a case study to explore how a social movement transformed as it expanded to become a transnational movement. It examines the interconnectedness of a transnational social movement that emerged in Europe and expanded globally. Methods included the systematic analysis of newsletters, e-mails, flyers, websites, the Slow Food USA blog, newspaper articles and brochures, complemented by interviews and talks with leaders of the local Tucson chapter and participant observation at local and national events. Findings demonstrate that the political climate during the 1960s facilitated the spread of the original ideas of the SFM via brokerage and loose networks. However, in order to make the shift from the local to the global sphere, the SFM made the choice of implementing a hierarchical structure in which the top tier is solely in charge without consulting the local. Since this movement’s mission is anti-globalization in nature (i.e. it is against the notion of imposing universal principles onto the local), the shift to the global accomplished by implementing an anti-democratic organizational structure goes against the very principles this movement claims to uphold. Structurally the Slow Food Movement reflects a global movement and it furthermore promotes itself to appear as one coherent movement by the employment of a global, anti-globalization frame through individual mission statements and by a unity of display in the physical layouts of the various SFM websites. While structurally the local convivia and the national Slow Food levels are indeed parts of a large, hierarchical SFM, the individual levels are able to symbolically distance themselves from the notion of the “global” by distributing level appropriate messages. Through intentionally created advocacy networks reflected as projects and organizations (e.g. Terra Madre , Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity, Presidia and the Ark of Taste ) a transnational network exists through which information is exchanged on a regular basis; however, coordinated tactics or joint mobilization across national borders could not be observed. Hence, the global position of the SFM is only a theoretical or symbolic position. Furthermore, the findings in this study highlight the importance of the organizational infrastructure as resource mobilization for social movements that shift beyond the local. The SFM purposely shifted from loose networks to an organizational hierarchy, resulting in a professional movement tied together through special created advocacy networks. This organizational structure leading to a professional social movement was a purposely-applied tactic to bring together a number of conscience constituencies that collaborate for the goals and mission of the movement. Nevertheless, while the various groups and projects share similar objectives, they are small, segmented, and autonomous cells that work on very specific local or national levels. The findings stress the persistent significance of the local and national level of social movements.",891772065,,Dissertations & Theses," Springer, AlexandraSpringerAlexandraSpringer, Alexandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2459520551 , 64372871 , 66569 , 9781124872339 , 3475731 , 3475731", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124872339, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/891772065?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Globalization , Mobilization , Slow food , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Slow+food%3A+A+globalized+social+movement+with+an+anti-globalization+mission&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Springer%2C+Alexandra&amp;isbn=9781124872339&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"468,Morality and personhood in the Hmong diaspora: A person-centered ethnography of migration and resettlement,"This dissertation is concerned most fundamentally with understanding the various cultural and psychological adaptations that result from migration to different locations. I employ a person-centered ethnographic approach to investigating these patterns in a transnational group of Hmong families that migrated to both Thailand and the United States. Morality and personhood are particularly fertile domains for investigating these psychocultural variations that emerge in different contexts. The methodological design of this project involves a comparative, transnational, and intergenerational framework that provides a unique basis to addressing these questions. I begin by documenting some of the important changes that are occurring in Hmong refugee communities in the diaspora. These include language shift, changing kinship and ritual networks, and the proliferation of several messianic movements that I encountered in my fieldwork. I argue that these changes can be attributed at least in part to the ways in which social dispersion in the Hmong diaspora have disrupted traditional religious practices and dispersed kin-based ritual networks. I proceed to describe a Hmong cultural model of 'ancestral personhood,' which is a prominent way that Hmong imagine the life course that includes post-mortal existence and regular interactions between living and deceased kin. This model of personhood drives reasoning about the three ethics (autonomy, community, divinity). Through a transnational comparison of parents and children in Hmong refugee families in both Thailand and the United States, I argue that families in both locations manifest similar life-course trajectories in moral development. This trajectory entails a spike in autonomy-oriented thinking in late adolescence, which is partially displaced by ethics of community (and to a lesser extent divinity) in later life. Given the nature of this carefully selected comparative sample, I argue for an interpretation of these data that emphasizes a Hmong-specific life course trajectory in explaining observed generational differences. These trends challenge the predominant social science models of ""acculturation"" and ""assimilation"" in important ways. Coupled with my exegesis of ancestral personhood, I ultimately argue for the importance of considering changes in moral thought over the life course and challenging the linear assumptions of some theories of social change in migration scholarship.",894260362,,Dissertations & Theses," Hickman, Jacob R.HickmanR.JacobHickman, Jacob R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2469543191 , 60012461 , 66569 , 9781124868158 , 3472863 , 3472863", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124868158, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/894260362?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0451 Social psychology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0451 Social psychology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0451 Social psychology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0451 Social psychology"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Asian American Studies , Social psychology , Morality , Diaspora , Migration"," Social sciences , Psychology , Diaspora , Hmong , Hmong diaspora , Life course development , Migration , Morality , Person-centered ethnography , Personhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Morality+and+personhood+in+the+Hmong+diaspora%3A+A+person-centered+ethnography+of+migration+and+resettlement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hickman%2C+Jacob+R.&amp;isbn=9781124868158&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"469,The social movements in contemporary Spanish culture,"This work analyzes the activity of social movements of the last thirty years in Spain through a cultural perspective that includes political cinema and literature of compromise. Anti-globalization, workers' and migration movements are articulated through the disagreement of an active civil society that revitalizes the democracy. This dissertation attempts to address questions such as what is the political? What is subjectification? How does the political subject arise? What is emancipation? I use the readings of thinkers such as Ranciere, Laclau, Mouffe, Negri, Hardt, Virno, Badiou, Balibar, Foucault, Esposito, and Zizek to analyze novels such as Belén Gopegui's El padre de Blancanieves and Juan Goytisolo's Paisajes después de la batalla , fiction films as Chus Gutierrez's Poniente , and the collective films Invisibles y En el mundo a cada rata , and finally documentary films like Voces contra la globalización by Carlos Estevez, Rosa de Foc by Unidad Documental Jorge Muller, Numax presenta , and Veinte años no es nada by Joaquim Jorda, Colectivo Discusión's 14 200 Km , and Ana Torres' Si nos dejan . In the first chapter, I maintain that the Anti-globalization movement represents the multitude or biopolitical monster that confronts the Leviathan State and the main international economic organizations, looking for new nodal points to articulate a contra-hegemonic power that recovers the common and the community. The second chapter attempts to recover the autonomous worker movement of the seventies in order to address the precarious situation of workers thirty years later, workers who manage to maintain a strong class-consciousness together with a general intellect . The last chapter shows the migration movement as the part with no part that may signal the new proletariat that reclaims democratizing borders and a transnational citizenship in a society of biopolitics. The multiplicity of groups, associations, and collectives which form these three social movements signal the reemergence of a socially active citizens, a different understanding of what the cosmopolitics means and a reformulation of the idea of a democracy. They represent civil disobedience, the resistance of multiple social actors, the necessity of the politicization of the economy and the inclusion of the marginalized subject.",895978744,,Dissertations & Theses," Entrambasaguas, JavierEntrambasaguasJavierEntrambasaguas, Javier",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2474498261 , 62398021 , 66569 , 9781124896809 , 3476312 , 3476312", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124896809, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/895978744?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Film studies",," 0313 Romance literature , 0900 Film studies"," Romance literature , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Compromise literature , Emancipation , Political cinema , Social movements , Spain , Subjectification",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+social+movements+in+contemporary+Spanish+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Entrambasaguas%2C+Javier&amp;isbn=9781124896809&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"470,"Margins of the &lt;i&gt;Mahjar&lt;/i&gt;: Arabic-Speaking Immigrants in Argentina, 1880–1946","This project examines how the Arabic-speaking immigrant community in northwestern Argentina integrated into local society while still preserving ties to their homelands. Emigration from Greater Syria (contemporary Syria and Lebanon, historical Palestine, and parts of Turkey and Iraq) was part of a global process from 1846 to 1940 in which more than 150 million people migrated to the Americas, Southeast and Central Asia, Manchuria and Siberia. Indeed, mass migration of diverse ethnic and religious groups was a signature feature of this near century of movement as 51 million people migrated from Europe (equivalent to twenty percent of its population) to the Americas, as did two million people from Asia and the Levant. After the United States, Argentina was the most popular destination for those heading west and possessed one of the fastest growing economies during the same era. By 1914, the Arabic-speaking immigrant community, comprising more than 100,000 Christians, Jews, and Muslims, became the third largest immigrant group in Argentina, trailing only Italians and Spaniards. I seek to understand how immigrants survived in a foreign and at times hostile society while maintaining links with the old country. In Argentina, the Arabic-speaking population emerged as an economic powerhouse and a maligned immigrant group. This community became the preeminent ethno-national commercial force in Tucumán, a northwestern province, by 1920, surpassing even Argentine merchants. As this immigrant group grew in commercial strength, members began to penetrate local Argentine social institutions despite limited avenues to political participation and power. Conversely, men from Greater Syria also had the highest arrest rates of any national group in Tucumán for disorderly conduct, aggravated assault and larceny between 1908 and 1941, suggestive of local prejudice and weak social networks for poorer immigrants. Arabic-speaking women worked as domestic servants, owned shops, formed charity organizations, and raised families passing on cultural heritage. Furthermore, as issues of social class intersected with political transformations in the homeland (Greater Syria), immigrants contested rights of association and leadership in organized immigrant groups in Argentina. My dissertation demonstrates that the composition of the Arabic-speaking community changed over time in response to a whole host of issues, including transnational politics, competing notions of gender and family roles, and economic opportunities and limitations. While some may have run afoul of the law, the community did not break down into religious divisions that might have threatened either their general identities or their connections to their new place of residence. Thus, like Arabic-speaking communities in the United States and elsewhere in the world, immigrants from Greater Syria residing in Argentina experienced years of religious coexistence and cooperation, rather than conflict.",898582858,,Dissertations & Theses," Hyland, Steven Leroy, Jr.HylandLeroyStevenJr.Hyland, Steven Leroy, Jr.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2487065931 , 64895101 , 66569 , 9781124910314 , 3477014 , 3477014", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124910314, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898582858?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Latin American history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Arabic-speaking , Argentina , Immigrants , Mahjar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Margins+of+the+Mahjar%3A+Arabic-Speaking+Immigrants+in+Argentina%2C+1880%E2%80%931946&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hyland%2C+Steven+Leroy%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9781124910314&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"471,Black Bogotá: The politics and everyday experience of race in post-constitutional reform Colombia,"This dissertation is an ethnographic examination of the lived experience of multicultural constitutional reform and juridical recognition among black populations in Colombia. The Constitutional Reform of 1991 and subsequent Law 70 of 1993 – also called the Law of Black Communities – made Colombia one of the first countries in Latin America to recognize black people as a distinct cultural group and grant them rights to collective territories, political representation, and cultural protections. However, my research reveals that Colombian blackness is enshrined in the new constitution as “black communities” ( comunidades negras ), an ethnic identity and political subjectivity limited to the rural Colombian Pacific region, subsistence practices, and cultural traditions. Grounded in anthropological theory and methods, Black Bogotá compares collective and individual experiences of race in post-recognition Colombia among two distinct sets of black actors-- activists and capital city residents. Among black activists, I found that the law’s focus on ethnicity and culture neutralized urban antiracist activism as it bolstered rural, grassroots movements that could couch their claims in cultural difference, ethnic identity, and territory. These rural movements found greater traction within legal discourses on blackness, and later among transnational activist communities when they mobilized around the state’s failure to protect their legal rights. Meanwhile, my interviews and participant observation with black residents of Bogotá reveal that they creatively conceptualize black identity, citizenship, and race from their positions as professionals, partners in interracial relationships, internal migrants to the capital, and parents rearing black children in a predominately Euro-Andean city, with much resistance to grassroots movement and legal constructions of Colombian blackness and black social issues. This project explores blackness as a cultural and a legal phenomenon, showing how race operates in daily social life outside of sites of predominately black populations, at the margins of state politics and law, and in conjunction with global discourses of rights and black identity. This research contributes to Latin American scholarship on race, ethnographic studies of transnational activism, and recent anthropological debates on the extent to which law can address social difference and inequality.",898994186,,Dissertations & Theses," Williams, Fatimah E.WilliamsE.FatimahWilliams, Fatimah E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2489374881 , 64803911 , 66569 , 9781124922294 , 3474979 , 3474979", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124922294, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898994186?accountid=14496," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Black studies , Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Afro-Colombians , Colombia , Multicultural politics , Race , Social movements , Transnationalism , Urban anthropology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+Bogot%C3%A1%3A+The+politics+and+everyday+experience+of+race+in+post-constitutional+reform+Colombia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Fatimah+E.&amp;isbn=9781124922294&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"472,On the Move: Transnational South Asian Dancers and the ‘Flexible’ Dancing Body,"""On the Move"" combines ethnography and political economy to explore the complex racial politics in which South Asian dancers are immersed as they move across national borders as well as on local stages. Focusing on key South Asian dancer-choreographers in the UK in the late 20 th /early 21 st century, including Shobana Jeyasingh, Nina Rajarani, Subathra Subramaniam, Mayuri Boonham, and Akram Khan, as well as the transnational dancers they employ, I examine the way in which race, citizenship, and labor intersect in globalization in often conflicting and paradoxical ways. My research is propelled by an interest in the personal and professional lives of South Asian dancers, the effects of globalization on their dance practices, work, careers, and bodies, and how they negotiate the contradictions between the global, the national, and the local in and through dance. I argue that South Asian dancers have developed an array of flexible practices in order to navigate the tensions between global capital and the nation-state, and that such flexible practices have been important in negotiating the contradictions between race and citizenship, reconfiguring social identities, and re-defining the contours of both South Asianness and Britishness. While I am critical of globalization, in particular its impact on labor flows and its toll on the body, I am also attentive to the power, creativity, strength, and flexibility of the dancing body to adapt to the inequalities and volatility of global capitalism. I suggest that late capitalism has created not just 'flexible citizens' but also flexible bodies. Despite efforts to regulate the transnational movements of racialized labor, South Asian dancers continue to make dance, and make dance work as a career; they continue to perform locally, nationally, and globally; and they continue to move in unruly and unpredictable ways. Thus the South Asian dancing body reveals not only the friction of bodily encounters in globalization but also the flexible corporeal tactics used by transnational dancers to move with, through, and against the often uneven and unequal flows of global capital.",900728891,,Dissertations & Theses," Kedhar, Anusha LakshmiKedharLakshmiAnushaKedhar, Anusha Lakshmi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2496229451 , 60480131 , 66569 , 9781124940199 , 3477418 , 3477418", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124940199, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/900728891?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Boonham, Mayuri , Citizenship , Dance , Flexibility , Jeyasingh, Shobana , Khan, Akram , Labor , Race , Rajarani, Nina , South Asian , South Asian dance , Subramaniam, Subathra , UK , United Kingdom",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+Move%3A+Transnational+South+Asian+Dancers+and+the+%E2%80%98Flexible%E2%80%99+Dancing+Body&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kedhar%2C+Anusha+Lakshmi&amp;isbn=9781124940199&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"473,The people mobilized: The Mozambican liberation movement and American activism (1960–1975),"The anti-colonial struggles in lusophone Africa were the most internationalized wars on the continent. Involved were people from across the globe and across the socioeconomic and political spectrums - Chinese Communists and Portuguese right-wing dictators, American black nationalists in the urban North and South African white supremacists, cold warriors and human rights activists. The Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), was the only national liberation movement in the 1960s to receive aid from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. I contend that, because both FRELIMO and Portugal relied on support from the international community to wage war for over a decade (1964-1975), the anti-colonial wars in lusophone Africa were not only armed struggles, but also cultural and rhetorical battles. FRELIMO's program of socialist revolution which heralded human rights and social justice through education, non- racialism and gender equality resonated with the international shift to the left of the 1960s. Counterpoised were the Portuguese right-wing corporative dictatorship which espoused a ""Lusotropical"" civilizing mission for its African overseas provinces, and the white supremacist regimes of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa that militarily and economically dominated Southern Africa. This dissertation focuses particularly on the relationship between FRELIMO and the activists of the black freedom struggle and the New Left in the United States. It will show the significant contributions that American activists made to Mozambican liberation, as well as the impact that this transnational movement had on the entire Southern African region, on U.S. foreign policy, and on the United States' domestic social and political landscapes. I explore issues of colonialism, nationalism, and modernity within a cold war context using the lenses of race, class, and culture in the United States and southern Africa during the long Sixties. I also examine the significance of religious organizations and the moral imperative that underpinned the global advocacy supporting southern African independence. The development of a transnational network of activists that reached from rural Africa to the White House provided the leverage needed for southern Africans and their international allies to topple the Portuguese dictatorship and, eventually, end South African apartheid.",901112555,,Dissertations & Theses," Stephens, Carla R.StephensR.CarlaStephens, Carla R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2498796371 , 65271071 , 66569 , 9781124946924 , 3477790 , 3477790", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124946924, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/901112555?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history"," Black history , African history , American history"," Social sciences , Activism , Anticolonialism , FRELIMO , Liberation movement , Mondlane, Eduardo , Mozambique",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+people+mobilized%3A+The+Mozambican+liberation+movement+and+American+activism+%281960%E2%80%931975%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stephens%2C+Carla+R.&amp;isbn=9781124946924&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"474,The production of racialized masculinities in contemporary North American popular culture,"My dissertation troubles the continued valorization of normative, dominant, or hegemonic masculinities as white, male, Anglo, heterosexual, able-bodied, and middle-class. Through an interdisciplinary reading of cultural texts, I argue that newer representations of racialized masculinities—including racialized female and transmasculinities—reflect an overall rise in the visibility of racialized people in globalized forms of media. Such representations are informed by competing and overlapping discourses that include enduring colonial myths, ideologies of multiculturalism and neoliberalism, debates concerning human rights, global migration and citizenship, as well as those generated by a range of seemingly disparate social movements—including gay and lesbian, labour, feminist, Third World, civil rights, Indigenous, and other nationalist movements. Correspondingly, I contend that cultural texts are sites of contestation and pleasure where the ambivalence and possibilities of political subjectivities are played out. By demonstrating how the interconnected processes of racial and gender formation are historically constituted in the context of transnational capitalism and settler state colonialism, my dissertation exposes the constructed nature of normative and hegemonic masculinities and reveals how masculinities can be re-made in alternative, contradictory, and (arguably) progressive ways.

It presents a four-point model for approaching the study of United States human rights policy. The key element in all the cases is bonding social capital, also called affective politics. American policy towards the Soviet Union and Uganda both demonstrate the integration of international, transnational, and domestic politics. Taiwan receives special attention because U.S. Taiwan policy continues to exemplify the integration of international relations, transnational relations, and domestic politics. The Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) represents Taiwanese-Americans who care about promoting democracy on Taiwan and, ultimately, Taiwan's legal status as an independent country. FAPA cultivates and sustains relationships with members of Congress and their staff to create the Taiwan Caucus in the House and Senate, second in influence only to the Israel Caucus, which is cultivated by the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). This study investigates how the Taiwan Independence Movement (TIM) learned, in part from AIPAC, to become politically viable as an ethnic lobby in the 1980s after limited success in the 1960s and 1970s, despite lacking the voting power and financial resources of Jewish-Americans. This study examines how bonding social capital (affective politics) is used to compensate for deficiencies in financial capital and voting power (rational politics), thus creating the political capital that political entrepreneurs use to shape U.S. foreign policy. Political entrepreneurs include citizens, congressional staff, and members of Congress, who have an impact on U.S. foreign policy that is greater than we would expect if we studied their resources by using only a rational choice framework. This study demonstrates that scholars of international relations, transnational politics and American politics can analyze the biographies of political entrepreneurs and their emotional relationships to more fully understand U.S. foreign policy.",908349738,,Dissertations & Theses," Star, MarriahStarMarriahStar, Marriah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2526806101 , 64555791 , 66569 , 9781267014900 , 3481812 , 3481812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267014900, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/908349738?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0601 International Relations"," 0337 American history , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0601 International Relations"," 0337 American history , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0601 International Relations",," 0337 American history , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0601 International Relations"," American history , Entrepreneurship , International Relations"," Social sciences , Congress , Ethnic , Foreign policy , Lobbying , Social capital , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+United+States+of+the+World%3A+Human+rights%2C+political+entrepreneurship%2C+and+U.S.+foreign+policy+via+affective+and+rational+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Star%2C+Marriah&amp;isbn=9781267014900&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"476,Homeland Developments: Filipino America and the Politics of Diaspora Giving,"""Homeland Developments: Filipino America and the Politics of Diaspora Giving"" explores the implications of varying and situated giving practices in processes of diaspora formation.

Moving away from an initial premise of giving as simple charity, this dissertation understands organized and public efforts by Filipino Americans to better, help, or fight for a cause in the Philippines to be forms of giving that necessarily entail frameworks of human and social need, sanctioning attendant visions of societal transformation and, at times, the maintenance of the social order. This work insists on bringing together often disparate mechanisms--for example, philanthropy, emergency relief, humanitarianism, environmentalism, or social justice work--in an analysis of the discursivity of giving and its implications for counter-hegemonic practices and frameworks of social transformation.

In section one I argue black athletes used competition as a protest mechanism that confirmed their humanity, reasserted racial pride, and defined citizenship. In section two the scene shifts from national to a local context at San Jose State. By the late 1960s, campus protests at San Jose State became the first instance when collegiate black athletes successfully led a resistance movement in sport and society. In doing so they became an important component of the broader student and black freedom movement of the era, and added activism as an addendum to competition as the sole avenue of protest that tested the limits of American participatory democracy. Section three shifts the scene back to national and international contexts. As did participants in the 1960s black freedom movement, black athletes also grappled with the merits of Black Power. For athletes and non-athletes, debates on the merits of Black Power in sport and its relation to human rights and American participatory democracy engulfed the nation. Also similar to participants in the 1960s black freedom movement, black athletes, spectators, administrators, and politicians were not monolithic in their interpretations of Black Power and activism as protest mechanisms in sport. What culminated in 1968 was the total engagement of American society on debates related to sport, nation, gender, citizenship, and ideology.",909994714,,Dissertations & Theses," Ratchford, JamalRatchfordJamalRatchford, Jamal",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2532488671 , 65196381 , 66569 , 9781124984841 , 3481130 , 3481130", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124984841, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/909994714?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," African American Studies , Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Black athletic revolt , Nineteen 60s , Track and field",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+fists+and+fool%27s+gold%3A+The+1960s+black+athletic+revolt+reconsidered&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ratchford%2C+Jamal&amp;isbn=9781124984841&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"478,The making of meanings: The role of institutions and actors in the co-construction of field level interpretations and meaning systems,"This dissertation explores the interaction between structure and agency in the context of multi-level institutionalization. Institutions interplay in complex ways across the field, national and transnational levels. Those complex dynamics condition both the interpretations and convictions that actors produce and the ways they mobilize meanings in order to ""enact"" their interpretations and convictions under competing demands. These dynamics are explored in-depth through two empirical studies. The first looks at the role national institutions play in the transnational regulation of sovereign wealth funds. The second examines the role of actors and institutions in evolution of frames used for socially responsible investments. Both the empirical studies utilize qualitative research methods drawing upon multiple sources of data including participant observation, interviews and a wide range of documentary evidence and secondary material. These studies yielded three research papers, two of which are empirical and the third one is conceptual. The two empirical papers named respectively ""Sovereign wealth funds, the IMF and transparency"" and ""From God to markets"" attempt to answer theoretical questions around the role of institutions at multiple levels of transnational, national and field, and actors in constitution of interpretations and meanings. In addition, these papers mobilize and contribute to other theoretical frameworks including transparency, interpretive accounting, transnational governance, social movements and soft laws. The third paper named ""social responsibility and karma of market"", provides a conceptual framework for all the mechanisms claimed to translate the social behavior of firms to financial performance. It then sets out the firm attributes and institutional factors at multiple levels that mediate this link. Overall, this dissertation attempts to provide a better understanding of how competing institutions at different levels condition the actors' behavior and how actors selectively mobilize and edit the institutional frames and meanings.",911024144,,Dissertations & Theses," Mehrpouya, AfshinMehrpouyaAfshinMehrpouya, Afshin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2537846301 , 66204871 , 66569 , 9781267047311 , 3482810 , 3482810", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267047311, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/911024144?accountid=14496," 0272 Accounting , 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0272 Accounting , 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0272 Accounting , 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0272 Accounting , 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Accounting , Management , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Corporate social responsibility , Institutionalism , Responsible investments , Transnational governance , Transparency",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+making+of+meanings%3A+The+role+of+institutions+and+actors+in+the+co-construction+of+field+level+interpretations+and+meaning+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mehrpouya%2C+Afshin&amp;isbn=9781267047311&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"479,African occasional textiles,"The purpose of this thesis is to explore the aesthetic content and social function of African factory textiles that are designed to inform and persuade while elegantly adorning the human form. Through the use of color, iconography, symbols, and text, occasional prints communicate specific messages pertaining to social relationships, technology, and economic development. In a global amalgam of decorative artistic traditions, the visual message is projected through elements of design derived from such diverse sources as African textile motifs, Indian calicos and chintzes, Javanese batiks, and American and European factory prints. The result is a form of art and fashion that has shaped and is shaped by African social movements, political trends, and global events. Occasional textiles represent localized African experiences of the recent global history of state formation, technological change, and urbanization. They constitute a body of art explicitly framing political, economic, and environmental upheaval, while at the same time communicating aspirations for the future of a shared global society.",913102136,,Dissertations & Theses," Bishop, Catherine P.BishopP.CatherineBishop, Catherine P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2550170101 , 66505201 , 66569 , 9781267066329 , 1502862 , 1502862", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267066329, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/913102136?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0730 Museum studies , 0994 Textile Research"," 0293 African Studies , 0730 Museum studies , 0994 Textile Research"," 0293 African Studies , 0730 Museum studies , 0994 Textile Research",," 0293 African Studies , 0730 Museum studies , 0994 Textile Research"," African Studies , Museum studies , Textile Research"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Dress , Folk art , Iconography , Textiles",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=African+occasional+textiles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bishop%2C+Catherine+P.&amp;isbn=9781267066329&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"480,On the Generation of Power of the Powerless —A Study of Urban Renewal in Hong Kong from the Perspective of Political Sociology,"Relational and processual are the natures of Power. This research combines two theoretic frameworks of 'processualism' and 'generative' to suggest that power is generative, i.e. to acquire power is a process in which power is keeping generative. With an ethnography of a social movement in urban renewal area in Hong Kong, the dissertation systematically illustrates the generation of the power of the powerless, what is the opportunities and constrains of the powerless, the social drama of the generating process, the mechanism of its organization and social networks, the effective and variable repertoire of collective action, different ways in which it generates, and the political ecology it. As an organization of the powerless, H15 Concern Group has a good internal operating mechanism, and the core volunteers and residents make sacrifices and persist in advanced claims to good city. The pluri-class volunteers and multilevel networks from grassroots organization to international civil society concerned and devoted into this social movement, which made H15's struggling action showed positive and productive power. And this is the important reason that the power of powerless could be showed by the mass media and recognized by many people. H15 transformed from social movement organization to civil educational organization according to the changed situation. Although the efforts of H15 suffered a lot of failures, it became a very influential and powerful actor in the area of urban renewal and planning. The government also made efforts and improvements in the administration and ideas as a reaction of civil society's fights and appeals. The power generating from bottom to top, which is the power of the powerless, coexist with the governmental power without force, show a ""contending cooperation"" pattern of political culture in the complicated urban political ecosystem. This public managing pattern not only gives an opportunity for the powerless to voice and act, but also helps the political governance of the municipal authorities nowadays.",917386698,,Dissertations & Theses," Xia, XunxiangXiaXunxiangXia, Xunxiang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2568718561 , 66453341 , 66569 , 9781267099105 , 3491986 , 3491986", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267099105, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/917386698?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning",," 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," Social structure , Urban planning"," Social sciences , China , Civil society , Hong Kong , Political society , Power of the powerless , Social movement , Urban renewal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+Generation+of+Power+of+the+Powerless+%E2%80%94A+Study+of+Urban+Renewal+in+Hong+Kong+from+the+Perspective+of+Political+Sociology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xia%2C+Xunxiang&amp;isbn=9781267099105&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"481,Re-Educating “Victims” and “Aggressors” of Violence: Mapping Discourse and Practice in a Mexican Violence Prevention Education Program,"The international human rights movement against gendered violence provides a valuable site for understanding how new categories of meaning emerge and are applied to social practices around the world. Human rights discourse is always translated into local terms and situated within local contexts of power and meaning. This ethnographic research examines how gender and violence are discussed within a violence prevention education program located in a north central Mexican city. By observing interactions between facilitators and participants, participating in the program's sessions, conducting one-on-one interviews with the program's facilitators, and analyzing the manual used by the prevention education program, I explore how gender and violence are defined in a local setting. The project considers how transnational discourse on human rights and gendered violence has been adapted to become relevant to individuals' lives. This analysis reveals how global human rights discourse does not neatly translate to local settings.

Yet, activists in the emerging reproductive justice movement often use a human rights analysis to challenge the women's movement's emphasis on ""law on the books."" As such, reproductive justice activists consider how lack of economic and social human rights limit people's rights to have a child (e.g., for low-income women) and the right to parent (e.g., for incarcerated parents). A human rights frame is an unusual choice given its history in the US. In the 1940s, African American leaders unsuccessfully attempted to challenge racism through engaging human rights. However, their successful movement for limited civil rights became the model for successive US movements. Why, despite the dominance and success of a civil rights frame, did the later reproductive justice movement choose the human rights frame? In addition, what have been the consequences of this adoption on the wider women's movement? To answer these questions, I analyze SisterSong, a national reproductive justice coalition, and its engagement with human rights. This dissertation draws on interviews, archival documents, and participant observation. I explore the confluence of domestic and international events that led to this choice of mobilizing around human rights. Then, I examine specific ways activists leverage human rights through the concept of reproductive justice. I further demonstrate how women of color and their allies work to move narrow definitions of reproductive rights from a limited concept of ""choice"" toward a more inclusive reproductive justice. Finally, I examine the contradictory articulations of human rights consciousness exhibited by activists, and what their varying consciousness suggests for a possible domestic human rights movement. Many reproductive justice activists perceive that engaging with human rights-based reproductive justice allows them to bring their ""whole selves"" into a movement, rather than requiring alignment with competing movements that fail to address their complex (reproductive) realities. Even if human rights do not become institutionalized in the US legal system, we can expect increased deployment of human rights by marginalized communities that are increasingly demanding systemic justice not only limited legal reform.",918828661,,Dissertations & Theses," Luna, Zakiya ToyaLunaToyaZakiyaLuna, Zakiya Toya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2574861491 , 67121772 , 66569 , 9781267141897 , 3492931 , 3492931", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267141897, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/918828661?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," Womens studies , Sociology , Human rights , Reproductive health , Criminal justice , Abortion , Law"," Social sciences , Human rights , Intersectionality , Legal mobilization , Reproductive justice movement , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Domesticating+Human+Rights%3A+Possibilities+and+Ambiguities+in+the+Emerging+Reproductive+Justice+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Luna%2C+Zakiya+Toya&amp;isbn=9781267141897&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"483,Global human rights in an age of consumerism,"This dissertation traces the emergence of the global human rights movement, investigates the role of popular culture as a vehicle for mobilization, and critically examines why the movement has failed to adequately politicize its supporters in the process. Beginning in the mid-1970s, a broad shift began to take place in which ordinary people were routinely confronted with human suffering, as conflict and crisis assumed a role as ritualized news events. The public response to these phenomena demonstrated a capacity for solidarity and engagement based on cosmopolitan premises. The inception of a collective ethos of compassion, an awareness of the other based on empathy, can be considered a symptom of globalization, of a moral variety, and is a byproduct of shifting economic trends, advances in technology, and efforts toward transnational organization. Support for human rights advocacy has gained traction as a mainstream social cause and provides a set of principles with which average people mediate the world and their role in it. Yet, this transformation did not occur spontaneously, but rather was deliberately cultivated by movement architects through a series of popular culture mechanisms. However, the methods and strategies deployed to enlist the public in defense of human rights shaped the substance of their engagement. This dissertation addresses the discrepancy between the political content of advocacy campaigns and the failure of the campaigns to politicize supporters, suggesting flaws in the foundation of the human rights movement. In order to set itself on a path toward relevance and effectiveness, the movement must inculcate political engagement, maintain an alignment of principle and action, and resist the seductive features of the age of consumerism.",919002975,,Dissertations & Theses," Pruce, Joel R.PruceR.JoelPruce, Joel R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2575757741 , 57842491 , 66569 , 9781267128898 , 3491151 , 3491151", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267128898, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/919002975?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," International Relations , Political science , Human rights , Consumerism , Popular culture , Cosmopolitanism"," Social sciences , Advocacy , Consumerism , Frankfurt School , Human rights , NGOs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+human+rights+in+an+age+of+consumerism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pruce%2C+Joel+R.&amp;isbn=9781267128898&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"484,Savoring ideology: An ethnography of production and consumption in Slow Food's Italy,"With over 100,000 members in 153 countries, the Slow Food movement emphasizes the ethical and social dimensions of eating habits by creating a new kind of socially and ecologically aware consumerism. However, Slow Food's rhetorical emphasis on the agency of the consumer obscures the parallel role of the food producer, complicating inquiry into the broad claims for social justice presented by the movement. This dissertation examines the tension between the ideologies and practices of Slow Food and the locally-situated goals of small-scale food producers working to create economic, ecologic and cultural sustainability on daily basis. Multi-sited ethnographic research conducted in Italy between 2006–2009 explores 1) international, national, and regional Slow Food events and 2) everyday life and work on a Tuscan agriturismo (farm-based tourism estate). Through an analysis of discursive messages that consumers receive, on the one hand, and the experiences of food producers on the other, I argue that Slow Food's restructuring of the consumer/producer relationship may play out on paper and at conferences—and sometimes even at the table—but it does so less often and less obviously on fields and farms. Current scholarly work on alternative food networks emphasizes the structural and economic processes that connect food producers to politically-conscious consumers. I extend and elaborate this discussion through a critical analysis of Slow Food's rhetorical and discursive strategies, and link these findings to my ethnographic study of small-scale, organic food producers in Italy. An emphasis on the relationships between producers and consumers underscores the changing nature of society's relationship to food production and consumption, highlighting the reflexivity of Slow Food in response to local, national, and global change.",920121261,,Dissertations & Theses," Horner Brackett, Rachel AnneHorner BrackettAnneRachelHorner Brackett, Rachel Anne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2580031091 , 63209771 , 66569 , 9781267154323 , 3494159 , 3494159", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267154323, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/920121261?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Cultural anthropology , Agricultural economics"," Social sciences , Consumption , Food production , Italy , Organic farming , Slow Food",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Savoring+ideology%3A+An+ethnography+of+production+and+consumption+in+Slow+Food%27s+Italy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Horner+Brackett%2C+Rachel+Anne&amp;isbn=9781267154323&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"485,"Making history heal: Settler-colonialism and urban Indigenous healing in Ontario, 1970s-2010","This thesis focuses on the interrelationship between Canadian colonial histories and Indigenous healing. I begin by problematising how colonialism is invoked in contemporary scholarship on Aboriginal health and healing, and arguing for more precise historical methods and a more relational understanding of colonial processes. Historicising Indigenous agency is integral to this analysis. Whilst colonial continuities in contemporary Canadian public policy discourse is an important theme, I also attend to social movements, institutions, professions, and political and economic forces beyond the state. Indigenous healing as a socio-political movement itself has a history dating at least to the late 1960s. Urban Indigenous healing discourse is characterised by linking present-day suffering to collective historical losses, and valorizing the reclamation of Indigenous identity, knowledge and social relations. Drawing on urban Indigenous social histories from Kenora and Toronto, I consider the urban healing movement as an example of Indigenous resistance influenced by the international decolonization and North American Red Power movements, but which over time has also engaged with dominant institutions, professions, policies, and discourses, such as the concept of trauma. My analysis considers professionals and patients invoking historical trauma as political agents, both responding to and participating in broader shifts in the moral economy. These shifts have created the conditions of possibility for public victimhood to become a viable strategy for attracting attention and resources to suffering and injustice. The thesis highlights the centrality and complexity of self-determination in urban Indigenous healing, drawing on historical and ethnographic analysis from three southern Ontario cities. I analyse how the liberal multiculturalism paradigm dominant in health policy and health care settings contributes to mental health professionals' failure to recognise Aboriginal clients and issues. I argue that characterising pan-Aboriginal and ethno-national healing as approaches in opposition to one another produces an insufficiently nuanced analysis in the context of urban Indigenous subjectivities and social relations, where both approaches are valuable for different reasons.

This study explores the linguistic and cultural roles that social networks play in return migration. Six Japanese women who stayed in the United States for less than five years and who have since returned to Japan within the last 12-18 months filled out questionnaires and participated in ethnographic interviews. An analysis of their stories suggests that due to their cyclical migration pattern, the structures and functions of the social networks for return migrants were different from those studied previously for immigrant groups. The return migrants established temporary interactive networks that were short-term, highly valued with strong ties and were accessed only for the duration of the return migrants‘ stay in the host culture. The study also indicated that due to the limited time spent in the host culture, the findings from the Japanese return migrants revealed that a) linguistic and cultural maintenance is not always the motivating factor for adults to establish an L1 social network; b) membership into an L1 social network is not always automatic; c) the need to have an L1 social network in the host culture is related to the values and norms of the home culture because it helps to enforce the return migrants‘ self-identity as Japanese; and d) L2 social networks in the host culture that are comprised of international members do not facilitate the development of a bilingual/bicultural identity. In terms of language proficiency, this study discovered that for the Japanese return migrants, self-perception of low L2 proficiency led the return migrants to establish alternative L2 temporary social networks of international speakers of English. The international bilingual social network was not strengthened by cultural, racial, or ethnical factors but by the common trait that English was their second language. The findings confirm the importance of distinguishing social networks of return migrants and offer a challenge to reevaluate and redefine social networks in order to broaden the social network framework to include the linguistic and cultural complexity of return migrants.",922400304,,Dissertations & Theses," Kozuma, Jo A.KozumaA.JoKozuma, Jo A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2591061331 , 67505072 , 66569 , 9781267167736 , 3496911 , 3496911", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267167736, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/922400304?accountid=14496," 0441 English as a Second Language , 0455 Multicultural Education"," 0441 English as a Second Language , 0455 Multicultural Education"," 0441 English as a Second Language , 0455 Multicultural Education",," 0441 English as a Second Language , 0455 Multicultural Education"," English as a Second Language , Multicultural Education"," Education , Japan , Narrative inquiry , Return migrants , Second language proficiency , Social networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+social+networks+in+the+linguistic+and+cultural+integration+and+reintegration+of+Japanese+return+migrants&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kozuma%2C+Jo+A.&amp;isbn=9781267167736&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"487,"Activist globalization: How markets, societies and states empower cause-oriented action in transnational relations","This study examines how transnational conditions of markets, societies and states empower civic groups, social movements, advocacy networks or resisters to participate in cause-oriented action that connects two or more polities. Preliminary theses infatuated with the latest and thickest wave of globalization have blown back into a solidified antithesis. Under this influential antithesis, international interactions between states create more opportunities for transnational activism than do global flows between societies or markets. The evidence analyzed here suggests a refutation of that prevalent antithesis. Instead, it supports the synthesizing hypothesis of this study: The more markets and societies globalize and the more states interact, the more transnational activism occurs. The research conducted here develops on a promising explanatory typology that is the best attempt to answer the main question about activism in international relations (IR) studies at present. This dissertation builds on such theory, moderating short-range and statist imbalances in conventional IR and cross-national (comparative) research on the consequences of interstate regimes and political opportunity structures, respectively. The study goes on to make this prior scholarship more accurate, comprehensive and reflective. First, tests of the prime theory over a longer history, which predates 1945, here elevate globalism toward a favorable condition that is as consequential as internationalism for activism across borders. Second, this study conceptualizes four explanatory processes—or chains of causal mechanisms—that link activism mainly to encouragement from globalization. These original models expose a grand, causal theory to have outpaced its necessary processual, mechanismic bases. Finally, the study addresses the spatial transnationality and transnationalization of activism. It extends the typology of explanatory processes to distinguish the primary scale of activist actions from the locus of activist causes, along a domestic-foreign frontier. The extension renders as unexamined a conventional assumption that activism transnationalizes through a one-dimensional globalization from local toward global proportions. The dissertation uses qualitative, case-study and process-tracing, methods to compare and generalize beyond two transnational activist campaigns. These campaigns are situated temporally from the 1860s to the 1950s, geographically through inclusion of actors based in Brazil, and thematically via incorporation of biodiversity in activist deed or discourse.",923783655,,Dissertations & Theses," Pinto, Rodrigo G.PintoG.RodrigoPinto, Rodrigo G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2596770401 , 63275961 , 66569 , 9781267192882 , 3495585 , 3495585", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267192882, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/923783655?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," International Relations , Political science , Social structure , Globalization , Activism , Market economies , Advocacy"," Social sciences , Activism , Civil society , Global , Globalization , Multilateral , Social movement , Transnational advocacy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Activist+globalization%3A+How+markets%2C+societies+and+states+empower+cause-oriented+action+in+transnational+relations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pinto%2C+Rodrigo+G.&amp;isbn=9781267192882&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"488,"“Governing” the “Girl Effect” through Sport, Gender and Development? Postcolonial Girlhoods, Constellations of Aid and Global Corporate Social Engagement","The “Girl Effect” is becoming a growing global movement that assumes young women are catalysts capable of bringing social and economic change to their families, communities and countries, particularly in the Two-Thirds World. The evolving discourse associated with the Girl Effect movement holds implications for sport, gender and development (SGD) programs. Increasingly, SGD interventions are funded and implemented by transnational corporations (TNCs) as part of the mounting portfolio of global corporate social engagement (GCSE) initiatives in development. Drawing on postcolonial feminist international relations theory, cultural studies of girlhood, sociology of sport and governmentality studies, the purpose of this study was to explore: a) how young women in Eastern Uganda experience SGD programs; and b) how constellations of aid relations among a sport transnational corporation (STNC), international non-governmental organization (INGO), and southern non-governmental organization (SNGO) impacted and influenced the ways that SGD programs are executed, implemented and “taken up” by young women. This study used qualitative methods, including 35 semi-structured in-depth interviews with organizational staff members and young women, participant observation and document analysis in order to investigate how a SGD program in Eastern Uganda that is funded by a STNC and INGO used martial arts to build young women’s self-defence skills to help address gender-based, sexual and domestic violence. Results revealed martial arts programming increased confidence, challenged gender norms, augmented social networks and provided social entrepreneurial opportunities. At the same time, the program also attempted to govern young women’s sexuality and health, but did so while ignoring culturally distinct gender relations. Findings also highlighted the colonial residue and power of aid relations, STNC’s brand authority over SGD programming, the involvement of Western actors in locating “authentic” subaltern stories about social entrepreneurial work in SGD, and how the politics of the “global” sisterhood is enmeshed in saving “distant others” in gender and development work. Overall, this study found that the drive for GCSE, when entangled with neo-liberal globalization, impels actors working in SGD to look to social innovation and entrepreneurship as strategies for survival in an increasingly competitive international development climate.",925635164,,Dissertations & Theses," Hayhurst, Lyndsay Meredith CatherineHayhurstMeredith CatherineLyndsayHayhurst, Lyndsay Meredith Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2599485391 , 67665612 , 66569 , 9780494782156 , NR78215 , NR78215", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494782156, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/925635164?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure , 0814 Recreation"," Educational sociology , Womens studies , Social structure , Recreation"," Education , Social sciences , 0340 , 0453 , 0575 , 0700 , Corporate social responsibility , Girl effect , Girlhood studies , Global governance , International relations , Postcolonial , Postcolonial feminist theory , Sociology of sport , Sport",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CGoverning%E2%80%9D+the+%E2%80%9CGirl+Effect%E2%80%9D+through+Sport%2C+Gender+and+Development%3F+Postcolonial+Girlhoods%2C+Constellations+of+Aid+and+Global+Corporate+Social+Engagement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hayhurst%2C+Lyndsay+Meredith+Catherine&amp;isbn=9780494782156&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"489,A Filipino transnational advocacy network: A case study of the US bases cleanup campaign in the Philippines and the United States of America,"This research analyzes the nature and processes involved in the emergence, development and decline of transnational advocacy networks. By taking up a case study of a local environmental campaign that emerged in the Philippines and later on transformed into a transnational advocacy network, this research unearths concepts and themes that contribute to the knowledge-building on this type of social action by non-state actors. Using grounded theory as tool for analysis, I design a qualitative case study research and examine archival documents and 31 in-depth interviews to understand the lived experiences of the partner-organizations of the transnational advocacy network for the environmental cleanup campaign on the toxic contamination in the former US military bases in the Philippines. The emerging themes and concepts highlight four major insights on transnational advocacy networks in general and the toxic cleanup campaign in particular. First, I assert that the toxic cleanup campaign is an offshoot of enduring social movements against the US interventionist policies in the Philippines. Second, I theorize that given time and space, the nature of relationships among partner-organizations within transnational advocacy network can evolve from mere information sharing into a more engaged collaboration based on a combination of dimensions salient to the ongoing processes in the network. In the case study, the technical/legal, ethical and ethnic dimensions are more prominent in solidifying such transnational advocacy network. Third, I maintain that the dynamics within transnational advocacy networks as well as the social milieu in which they exist can create wedges of misunderstanding and distrust and can lead to the premature decline of transnational advocacy networks prior to achieving major successes and goals. In the case study, these factors include lack of accountability, security issues, or continuing disinterest on the advocacy. And fourth, I conclude that following decline of the transnational advocacy network, former partner-organizations are absorbed by various abeyance structures until such time these partners are ready to take on where their former advocacy work left off. In conclusion, the better-resourced partner has a greater success in moving forward after the decline, which is in keeping the cultural aspect of its organization, maintaining its vision, and restructuring its networks; and the least-resourced partners resort to being absorbed by assisting NGOs that can provide for their welfare.",927921669,,Dissertations & Theses," Gata, Ma.

As both an architect and an anthropologist, my central research objective was to analyze how shifts in Oaxacan's habitual practices enabled and engendered socio-political and subjective transformations. In eighteen months of ethnographic fieldwork (2007–2008), I thus worked closely with and became a member of a group of political street artists from marginalized communities who were part of the coalition of individuals, collectives, and social organizations that became the Popular Assembly of the People's of Oaxaca, or APPO. Focusing on practices of struggle such as the making and maintaining of barricades, protest marches, sit-in strikes, and making the art of protest, the dissertation argues that APPO's practices of struggle in Oaxaca have been both highly mobile and mobilizing. As the dissertation argues, greater attention to both senses of movement as moving bodies and the capacity of spatial practices to mobilize people affectively allows us greater understanding of the materiality and imagined political geographies of social movements. The dissertation focuses on the role of practices of struggle and the competing aesthetics of political street artists, protest groups, elite cultural and governmental institutions, and ordinary Oaxacans to emphasize the importance of everyday spatial practices and a recognition that, as Michel de Certeau writes, “history begins at ground level, with footsteps” (1984:129). Whether manifested as literal occupations and appropriations of city spaces or as different modalities for inhabiting and making place, Oaxacans' spatial practices disrupted dominant understandings and uses of the open and democratic nature of public space. In stenciling their graphic messages on city walls, street artists gave visual form to a long history of the systemic marginalization of the Oaxacan people and, more importantly, to the Oaxacan people's courage in mobilizing to find a solution. Speaking from the perspective of shared experiences and struggles, images on city walls revealed common points of identification that interpellated the collective subject of el pueblo (the people). Focusing on the transformative potential of artists' spatial practices through their investment in the material spaces of the city, my dissertation contends that political subjectivities are formed in and through an encounter with the city's material environment. Consequently, I argue that urban space is not a passive landscape but is an actant—to use Bruno Latour's terminology—that interpellates individuals as members of particular political publics. This is rendered visible, for example, in how an anti-government stencil hailing el pueblo on the façade of a municipal building invites a different mode for inhabiting social and physical space from a billboard promoting tourism for foreigners framing the city as the heritage and patrimony of all Oaxacans. An empirical and theoretical focus on these practices of struggle is central to work that I conceive of as an anthropology of urban space and provides a critical perspective on spatial practices that are changing definitions of political agency and public responsibility in an increasingly polarized urban world. Though artistic expression has been central to contemporary and past social movements such as those of the Black Panthers, the Chicano movement and the United Farm Workers, and more recent struggles against the World Trade Organization, the artistic and social relevance of this cultural production has not received much scholarly attention in anthropology. For the economically impoverished and socially marginalized youths that made up the street art collective I worked with, artistic expression and collective organization became a means not just to make their voices heard, however, but fostered communal practices that gave rise to alternative models of human flourishing or of “the good life.” Organized through participatory assembly, creating and collaborating on art projects as a group, and holding art workshops to teach artistic skills to members and others, members of the art collective were able to transform their isolation and create a space of dialogue and debate that produced a powerful sociality that went beyond aesthetic expression or the imagined political and social horizon of the social movement engendered by APPO. Assessing the social and political dynamics produced by the art of protest, the dissertation addresses how Oaxaca's terrain of political positioning was constantly shifting, putting into doubt the notion of a possible scripted strategy pre-existing the mobile dynamics of contestation and struggle. The practices of struggle that APPO engendered were an invitation to insurgency, yet lacked any roadmap. As situated spatial practices with multiple mobile manifestations, the practices exceed the possibility to pin down APPO as a political formation, model, or organization. This raises challenges for mapping Left and populist politics in Latin America and the Global South, yet offers new opportunities for considering the power and possibilities of social movements from Caracas to Cairo to change and challenge not just governing regimes, but dominant social norms and forms. Attentive to the spatial practices through which collective political subjectivities were formed in Oaxaca's social movement, my dissertation also brings a critical perspective to how social movements in the Global South are commonly assessed in political imaginaries in the West. Filtered through discourses of democratic representation or human rights, social movements are generally appraised in relation to the possibilities that these afford for subaltern groups to subvert the dominant structures that marginalize them by giving voice to the injurious workings of power. I argue that an important effect of the political imaginaries of resistance that emerge from this perspective is to conceive of political traction through the lens of what Michael Warner refers to as “state-based thinking.” Under the framework of state-based political imaginaries, agency is acquired in relation to the state and the state remains the means of political self-realization. However, by looking at the internal processes that social movements enable, I consider how social movements produce possibilities for social transformation that go beyond the external goals that they set forth. The mobilizing practices of struggle in Oaxaca demanded and gained recognition and rights to the city at a multiplicity of social and geographic scales. While marches, local media takeovers, and stencils on city walls were localized political practices, their political traction and demand for recognition addressed multiple audiences that included, but were not limited to, regional or federal government bodies. The dissertation argues that, when the state is imagined as the ground by which to secure social justice and political change, this marginalizes the productive power of practices of struggle in social movements as transformative of spaces and social relations in their own right. In a contemporary moment where democracy is both seen as the global future and yet is also in need of being defended and implemented militarily, the dissertation contends that practices of social protest in urban settings produce forms of organizing collective life that call into question prevalent conceptions of representative democracy and the state as the pinnacle of political organization. What emerges from an ethnographic analysis of the practices of struggle of the public assemblies, neighborhood barricades, political art on city walls, and the megamarches of millions are the ways in which these transcended the purely confrontational aspect of a repudiation of the governor to become their own point of reference; Oaxacans' embodied practices are forming alternative conceptions of ethical communities and a collective subject that bypasses state-based frameworks as the necessary horizon of Oaxaca's future. I thus argue that making the populist collective subject of “the people” is just as important as challenging the state in pursuing social justice and making a space for politics. Delimiting the political and social effect of APPO in relation to the authoritarian politics of Oaxaca's governor means neglecting how its mobilizing practices of struggle changed forms of political subjectivity and social community, with effects that continue to reverberate to this day.",929147529,,Dissertations & Theses," Arenas, IvanArenasIvanArenas, Ivan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2613853741 , 64403591 , 66569 , 9781267225665 , 3498755 , 3498755", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267225665, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/929147529?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0365 Art Criticism , 0729 Architecture"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0365 Art Criticism , 0729 Architecture"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0365 Art Criticism , 0729 Architecture",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0365 Art Criticism , 0729 Architecture"," Cultural anthropology , Art Criticism , Architecture"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Aesthetics , Democracy , Latin America , Mexico , Protest art , Social movements , Subjectivity , Urban anthropology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rearticulating+the+Social%3A+Spatial+Practices%2C+Collective+Subjects%2C+and+Oaxaca%27s+Art+of+Protest&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arenas%2C+Ivan&amp;isbn=9781267225665&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"491,"Revolutions: Art, Science, and Subjectivity in Modernism and Irish Post-Colonialism","Modernism, spoken of generally as a cross-cultural phenomenon, arises from a series of inter-related and tumultuous events in the twenty-first century. These include the anxieties affecting Western Europe around the fin-de-siècle and the first decades of the new millennium: the decline of the British Empire, The Great War, and anti-colonial nationalist movements across the Empire, but particularly in Ireland and India. Alongside, and often in conjunction with these momentous historical events, are witnessed nascent social movements by subaltern groups including women, labor, and colonized populations. Less often recognized are the intersections of historical, social and cultural shifts with revolutions in science, particularly in theoretical physics. At the height of literary Modernism, a textual revolution, one finds contemporary social, political and scientific revolutions. This study locates these connections in the pages of James Joyce's Ulysses and Virginia Woolf's The Waves , ultimately arguing that the modernist avant-garde borrows from the convulsive shifts occurring in cosmology and epistemology owing to the New Physics. Revolutionary physics are complementary to modernist textual revolutions, and provide a dynamic and shifting structure through which to describe the subaltern desire for social, political and economic revolution, as well as to begin to address what these new conditions may look like. This interdisciplinary approach is actually suggested in the earliest works of Western Literature. This is particularly so in Homer's Odyssey (from which Ulysses is adapted), in which the Euclidian models of space and time are poetically mapped onto the spaces of the known world, ultimately imposing a dichotomy of order versus chaos and civilization versus barbarism, through gendered tropes reliant on sexual difference. As such normative social organizations and normative science have historically worked in the service of a relatively uniform ideological paradigm. This sheds much light on the appeal of the scientifically revolutionary to the politics of modernist revolutionary aesthetics. At a glance, the history of the twentieth century has witnessed episodic improvements for many disenfranchised and subaltern groups. So, too, has it witnessed the rapid mechanization of life that defines modernity, the mechanization of mass death, increasing disparities in access to resources, the consolidation of power at the nexus of global capital and the State, and perhaps most immediately, neo-imperialism and neo-liberalism. Joyce, Woolf, in highlighting the constellation of forces that produce global and local inequalities, identify a space from which to begin to dismantle those ideological and institutional monoliths. This speaks meaningfully to the contemporary cooptation of the State by neo-liberal and neo-colonial ventures. In my final chapter, a comparative look at two films centered on Irish post-colonialism: Michael Collins and The Wind that Shakes the Barley , I argue that popular art may represent history in ways that are either complicit with the compounding moves of the State and global capital (the former), or, that they may show, as did Joyce and Woolf in their modernist politics, the sites of the dispossessed and disenfranchised as the very locations of resistance (the latter).",937029968,,Dissertations & Theses," Hays, Shannon M.HaysM.ShannonHays, Shannon M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2616742961 , 64842851 , 66569 , 9781267238757 , 3499440 , 3499440", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267238757, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/937029968?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0900 Film studies"," Comparative literature , British and Irish literature , Gender studies , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Gender , Ireland , Jordan, Neil , Joyce, James , Loach, Ken , Modernism , Neo-imperialism/liberalism , Postcolonialism , Quantum physics , Woolf, Virginia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revolutions%3A+Art%2C+Science%2C+and+Subjectivity+in+Modernism+and+Irish+Post-Colonialism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hays%2C+Shannon+M.&amp;isbn=9781267238757&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"492,"Shopping Our Way to a Better World? Gender, Sexuality and Moral Citizenship Under Ethical Consumerism","This femiqueer interdisciplinary project utilizes theories and methodologies of transnational feminisms, cultural studies, political economy and queer ecologies to investigate the effects of branding, certification and new media on capitalisms, environmentalisms, and moral citizenship, offering new theories of racialized gender, sexuality and class. The aim of this research is to determine whether contemporary forms of ethical consumerism emerging from different economic streams function in the same way, whether they originate from conventional trade or alternative trade. I test this through a null hypothesis using two contemporary ethical brands, the well-known Product (Red)™ campaign and women's fair trade coffee Café Femenino ® . My analysis of ethical consumerism maps the relationships between new trends in consumerism and gendered performances of national and global citizenship and belonging through an examination of marketing campaigns and the transnational movement of ethical goods and services. Key to this investigation is a careful consideration of factors like branding, business structure, and reason for the ethical product's existence. I propose that while ethical consumerism appears to be a progressive movement, it is fundamentally moralistic, and as such, constitutes a new disciplinary norm that both reproduces and rearranges older forms of valuation based on categories of identity such as gender, race, class, sexuality and geographic location. Yet, fissures of economic alternatives are created by and resisted through these disciplinary norms, offering productive possibilities for social justice within and alongside contemporary forms of globalized ethical consumption. My results demonstrate that Café Femenino ® and Product(Red)™ are not the same kind of brand, but that they co-evolve to mimic one another in appearance if not business structure. By proving that Product (Red)™ and Café Femenino ® do not offer the same kind of brand experience to consumer citizens, I provide justification for further research in this widely-speculated upon but theoretically scanty field.",963531448,,Dissertations & Theses," Heiliger, Evangeline MarcellaHeiligerMarcellaEvangelineHeiliger, Evangeline Marcella",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2624078061 , 68327372 , 66569 , 9781267243997 , 3501970 , 3501970", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267243997, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/963531448?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0733 Gender studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0640 Sustainability , 0733 Gender studies"," Womens studies , Sustainability , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Ethical consumerism , Gender , Moral citizenship , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Shopping+Our+Way+to+a+Better+World%3F+Gender%2C+Sexuality+and+Moral+Citizenship+Under+Ethical+Consumerism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heiliger%2C+Evangeline+Marcella&amp;isbn=9781267243997&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"493,Indigenous Rights in the Peruvian Amazon: A New Social Movement,"In 2008, President Alan García created a package of legal decrees that sought to expropriate indigenous land and sell it to international corporations as part of his neoliberal agenda. The social movement in the Peruvian Amazon quickly responded by claiming that the decrees breached indigenous rights, particularly the one to previous consultation, stipulated by The Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples of 2007 and the International Labor Organization's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169 of 1989, both ratified by the state. This thesis analyzes the complex social relations between the state and the social movement in the Amazon. The first chapter examines the social conditions under which a social movement in the Amazon was formed as well as how Amazonian indigenous leaders surfaced creating social organizations and producing a strategy based upon an indigenous identity. The second chapter explores the transitional period during the 1990s and early 2000s, in which a neoliberal shift intensified the exploitation of indigenous communities' land, while multiculturalism introduced international discourses used by the social movement to politicize their demands and achieve goals. Finally, the third chapter explores the conflict between the state's rhetoric of progress and development used to advance neoliberal policies, and the response of indigenous activists through their indigenous-rights strategy. Through this analysis, this study argues that a new indigenous movement has emerged in the Peruvian Amazon through a self-proclaimed indigenous identity, where indigenous activists are using international documents to politicize indigenous issues in the Amazon and challenge power relations, citizenship, and indigenous rights, creating new social interactions and shedding light on indigenous issues and the Amazon.",1012122010,,Dissertations & Theses," Aviles, Daniella OdetteAvilesOdetteDaniellaAviles, Daniella Odette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2657066661 , 69093202 , 66569 , 9781267288080 , 1508856 , 1508856", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267288080, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1012122010?accountid=14496, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies,, 0550 Latin American Studies, Latin American Studies," Social sciences , Indigenous movements , Indigenous people , Indigenous rights , Peru , Peruvian Amazon , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indigenous+Rights+in+the+Peruvian+Amazon%3A+A+New+Social+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aviles%2C+Daniella+Odette&amp;isbn=9781267288080&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"494,Resisting occupation and authoritarianism Iraqi feminist movements after the U.S. invasion,"After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, Iraqi women were among the first to organize into political and humanitarian organizations. Officials from the United States government and Coalition Provisional Authority announced that Iraqi women were ""free"" and ""liberated,"" but media reports, scholarship, and statements from Iraqi women suggest that women's rights have not been fully realized. Rather than portray Iraqi women as victims of occupation or patriarchal traditions, this paper uses social movement theory to examine how Iraqi women have organized to work greater rights. Relying primarily on statements from Iraqi women, this thesis distinguishes between two separate feminist movements in Iraq: liberal feminism and Islamic feminism. Though these are not meant rigid categories, they constitute two separate movements that define women's rights differently and engage is different kinds of activities in to push for these rights. The paper begins by examining how the liberal feminist movement has responded to the agendas of the United States government and international NGOs in Iraq. While various organizations within the movement differ in their stance on the presence of U.S. troops or on whether to accept foreign funding, they come together as part of a unified feminist movement that engages in the claim-making and displays of worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment that define a social movement. This is also clear in the way the liberal feminist movement deals with the Iraqi government. Various organizations came together to mount a unified campaign for changes to the constitution and greater political power for women. In addition to a liberal feminist movement, Iraq also has an emerging Islamic feminist movement that distinguishes itself by its effort to reinterpret Islamic law and frame women's rights as part of proper adherence to Islam. This movement frames women's rights and political events differently than the liberal feminist movement, and engages in different kinds of displays of worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment. In addition to differentiating between Islamic and liberal feminist movements, this paper also differentiates between Islamic feminists and the Islamist members of political parties who use Islamic law to oppress women rather than reinterpreting it to argue for greater rights for women. Finally, the paper concludes by examining the future of feminist movements in Iraqi in light of the Arab Spring, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and the increasingly authoritarian Iraqi government.",1012772147,,Dissertations & Theses," Kidwell Hughes, KellyKidwell HughesKellyKidwell Hughes, Kelly",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2660281031 , 69126872 , 66569 , 9781267297860 , 1509196 , 1509196", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267297860, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1012772147?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Womens studies , Middle Eastern Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Resisting+occupation+and+authoritarianism+Iraqi+feminist+movements+after+the+U.S.+invasion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kidwell+Hughes%2C+Kelly&amp;isbn=9781267297860&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"495,The Globalization of Indigenous Women's Social Movements and the United Nations System (1992–2012),"""The Globalization of Indigenous Women's Movements and The United Nations System (1992–2012)"" is a comprehensive study of the globalization of indigenous women's movements that materialized in the early 1990s. These movements flourished parallel to other transnational social movements, such as International Zapatismo, the World Social Forum, and Gender as Human Rights Movement, yet they are omitted and remain invisible within transnational and global social movement literature. This study is an inscription of these processes, through the construct of a textual space that exposes a global decolonial feminist imaginary grounded in the oral histories of thirty-one international indigenous women leaders. The primary site for this study is the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), a venue where contact amongst indigenous women worldwide occurs annually at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York City. This qualitative study uses decolonial and feminist methodology to examine in-depth semi-structured interviews, transcriptions of key speeches, plenaries and interventions made by indigenous women at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and other relevant international forums, and field notes compiled from my full-participant and participant-observation in international forums. My dissertation makes two claims. First, I argue that indigenous women have made formal gains within the UN System via an unprecedented process of simultaneously accepting, contesting and altering the structural opportunities and constraints present within the UN. These processes made it possible for UNPFII's actors and their key claims to be effectively integrated within the multiple agencies that make up the UN. I identify key Indigenous actors and trace their claims for social justice, which have transcended the domestic sphere to the global political arena. Second, I argue that, globalization has reconfigured transnational political spaces for indigenous women activists and that these UN advocates frame their claims for rights in a unique way, in a process that combines individual human rights as well as collective indigenous peoples rights.",1014168988,,Dissertations & Theses," Gonzalez, Rosalee C.GonzalezC.RosaleeGonzalez, Rosalee C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2664282801 , 69269662 , 66569 , 9781267310828 , 3506033 , 3506033", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267310828, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1014168988?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Social research , Womens studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Globalization , Indigenous women , Social movements , United Nations , Xicanas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Globalization+of+Indigenous+Women%27s+Social+Movements+and+the+United+Nations+System+%281992%E2%80%932012%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gonzalez%2C+Rosalee+C.&amp;isbn=9781267310828&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"496,Los subordinados y los dominantes: La jerarquía social en la ficción de Jorge Franco,"Of all the writers associated with the McOndo movement, a literary movement that focuses on the reality of urban life for millions of young Latin Americans, Jorge Franco is perhaps the most distinguished.

The Politics to Democratize Human Rights in the Post-Conflict Balkans,"This dissertation examines the politics of post-conflict justice in the former Yugoslavia. It discusses the protagonistic role of human rights activists in challenging existing transitional justice models that emphasize international and domestic war crimes trials over restorative justice mechanisms—including truth commissions, reparations and memorials, among others. Using a political sociology perspective, this study goes beyond statist, normative and legalist scholarship on accountability after mass atrocity and builds on an emerging literature in the social sciences that focuses on the impact of global human rights on the national and local level. It analyzes human rights advocates’ recent efforts to initiate a transnational fact-finding body—called the Coalition for RECOM Initiative—in the post-conflict Balkans against the backdrop of the successes and challenges of the UN-created International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) as well as the difficulties of national judiciaries to prosecute war crimes and gross human rights violations across the region. This victim-centric fact-finding movement—whose primary goal is to establish a transnational commission in charge of collecting testimonies about human rights abuses and war crimes—is an attempt to introduce a holistic and complementary transitional justice strategy that goes beyond the unidimensional retributive justice approach in the Balkans. Concentrating on individuals and society, instead of high politics (such as the European Union enlargement process with its broad political and economic agenda) this bottom-up initiative is an important step to democratize transitional justice processes in the post-conflict Balkans. The study explores the efforts promoted by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in several Balkan states—particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia—to coordinate a transnational campaign to cope with past mass atrocities. It discloses the struggle that this movement faces from within—confronted by diverging interests of its members—and from outside, as it seeks political and financial support from international and region-specific organizations as well as national governments. Drawing on participant observation and in-depth interviews (along with archival material, including reports, policy briefs, strategy papers, press releases and news articles, among others) this research examines how these NGOs organize their relations with international actors (such as the ICTY), national judiciaries and their constituencies to discuss, interpret, and identify meanings of human rights and democracy within and across state-boundaries of countries in the former Yugoslavia. It traces how, the extent to which, and with what effect these meanings travel and transform through the movement’s transnational networks and practices, and attempts to see whether and how they influence the NGOs’ campaign for political and legal institutional change within the region.",1015033857,,Dissertations & Theses," Kurze, ArnaudKurzeArnaudKurze, Arnaud",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2666155011 , 69317162 , 66569 , 9781267316011 , 3506226 , 3506226", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267316011, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1015033857?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," International Relations , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Human rights activism , International criminal law , International humanitarian law , NGOs , Post-conflict Balkans , Regional Truth Commission , State-society relations , Transitional justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Justice+Beyond+Borders%3F+The+Politics+to+Democratize+Human+Rights+in+the+Post-Conflict+Balkans&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kurze%2C+Arnaud&amp;isbn=9781267316011&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"498,Toward a Filipino/a Critical (FilCrit) Pedagogy: A Study of United States Educational Exposure Programs to the Philippines,"Through a qualitative study fusing participatory action methods with a focus group, testimonio, individual interviews, and cultural analysis, this project examines U.S. educational exposure programs to the Philippines. Organized and united by a social movement that traverses a Philippine diaspora, exposure programs enable participants to visit the Philippines for a short-term immersion where they are hosted by sectors of interest. This study explores the pedagogy that exposure programs enable as participants learn about the everyday realities challenging a Philippine polity and how systems of knowledge are being reframed and transformed. Placing Filipino/a American transnational activism at the center of analysis contributes to the field as this particular community group is sparsely examined in critical educational discourses. Of interest is how their praxis in exposure programs to the Philippines offers insight to critical theories, research methodologies, and educative social practices that seek the transformation of oppressive global relations of class, race, and gender. The manuscript is divided into two sections: 1) Research Process and 2) Research Findings. Research Process consists of: an introduction; a description of the theoretical frameworks (critical pedagogy, feminist standpoint theory, critical theories of race, and Filipina critical theory) that the study builds upon in examination of Filipino/a American transnational praxis; an overview of the qualitative tools utilized to document experiences of research participants; and a historical genealogy exploring the social conditions that have cultivated historical forms of Filipino/a American counter-consciousness. The Research Findings section is divided into four chapters. Beginning with Chapter Five, which utilizes the testimonio of an exposure participant as a point of departure to conceptualize how such programs cultivate what I term a “diasporic counter-consciousness.” Nascent in a new generation of Filipino/a Americans, a “diasporic counter-consciousness” links Filipino/a American identity as contingent upon: 1) the fate of a population dispersed throughout the globe and; 2) the eradication of neocolonial conditions in the Philippines. Chapter Six explores the transnational praxis of participants and its implications for the theorizing of race (drawing explicitly from the cultural media created in a hip hop exposure and in generative conversation with the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois). Chapter Seven demonstrates how the interaction of feminist standpoint theory with the experiences of Filipina American exposure participants can point to a “Filipina diasporic standpoint.” Such a standpoint provides a uniting positionality where the labor, land, and lives of Filipina women across the diaspora are not alienated from them but rather channeled in the service of their own needs and the potentials of a greater humanity. Chapter Eight is a coda to the research project, summarizing the central themes outlined for Filipino/a Critical Pedagogy.",1018065375,,Dissertations & Theses," Viola, Michael JosephViolaJosephMichaelViola, Michael Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2675384311 , 69528882 , 66569 , 9781267350176 , 3508951 , 3508951", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267350176, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018065375?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Asian American Studies , Pedagogy , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Education , Critical pedagogy , Critical race theory , Ethnic studies , Feminist theory , Filipino Americans , Participatory action research , Philippines",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toward+a+Filipino%2Fa+Critical+%28FilCrit%29+Pedagogy%3A+A+Study+of+United+States+Educational+Exposure+Programs+to+the+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Viola%2C+Michael+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781267350176&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"499,Strategic citizenship: Dual marginalization and organized transnational political mobilization among Ecuadorian and Dominican migrants,"What factors define transnational political participation and citizenship for contemporary migrants? This dissertation focused on how and why migrant activists from Ecuador and the Dominican Republic pursued political engagement, how their home country governments influenced migrants' political activities, and how migrant organizations shaped their transnational activities. The study found that transnational political participation among these two populations was driven by a dual marginalization narrative, where migrants draw from their personal experiences to conclude that they are marginalized in both the U.S. and in their countries of origin based on their status as migrants. Ecuadorian and Dominican political organization leaders use this dual marginalization to create a political identity to demand minority-group rights in both home and host countries. Migrant activists make calculated decisions on where to focus their claims for rights, which I refer to as strategic citizenship Strategic citizenship is shaped by nation-state actions and local organizations. The Ecuadorian and Dominican governments influence strategic citizenship through: 1) public discourse that defines migrants' status in society; 2) the rule of law; and 3) policies that shape the state-migrant relationship. While the Ecuadorian governments' actions encouraged greater migrant participation, the Dominican government's approach was more contentious, creating skepticism among migrants towards engagement. In both cases government policy, reinforced feelings of dual marginalization. Strategic citizenship was also influenced by the different organizations in which migrant activists were involved. Migrants active in home country political parties had considerable advantages in resources and government connections, but were stifled by national party demands, member attrition and unstable leadership. Social movement and civic organizations struggled to harness resources, but had more stable leadership, more ideological autonomy and cohesive membership. I conclude that migrant political transnationalism, when examined through a contentious politics framework, originates from shared experiences engendered by the migration experience, which is reinforced by nation-state and used by organized actors frame migrant collective action. Migrants' claims for minority rights in both sending and receiving countries reflect how these actors perceive their condition to be a consequence of ruling elite actions in each country, as well as their perceived contributions as subjects of two nation-states.",1018101019,,Dissertations & Theses," Caro-Lopez, HowardCaro-LopezHowardCaro-Lopez, Howard",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2675753341 , 68147412 , 66569 , 9781267344557 , 3508656 , 3508656", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267344557, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018101019?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Latin American Studies , Political science , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Immigration , Latin America , Marginalization , Political mobilization , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Strategic+citizenship%3A+Dual+marginalization+and+organized+transnational+political+mobilization+among+Ecuadorian+and+Dominican+migrants&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Caro-Lopez%2C+Howard&amp;isbn=9781267344557&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"500,"Free spaces, collective identity and political consciousness: Student activism and repression on West Java, Indonesia, 1920–1979","Whereas previous studies of the Indonesian student movement have been limited to studies of single episodes of activism of student protests, this work focuses on the narratives, and repertoires that, together with crucial external events of political and economic realignments created both pressures and opportunities that produced contentious identities of Indonesian student activism. This study reveals the development of a particular type of contentious student activism was driven by private frustrations, grievances and intellectual concerns, and that led to particular forms of collective action that became institutionalized in two ways: (1) as a repertoire relied on by students; and (2) more generally, as a culturally acceptable mode of expressing opposition. However, the development of student's political consciousness did not reflect only political grievances and frustrations. Student activism was the result of many different resources and opportunities. To be successful, student movements required both the physical and conceptual space in which they could construct political opposition. This dissertation challenges the assumption that free spaces must always be local, free and participated in by groups from below. Free spaces may be as important for highly-visible privileged groups as they are for an invisible subaltern. This may force activists to seek free spaces in places far from local settings supported by transnational actors and social networks. This study finds this phenomenon in fields as different as the anti-European anti-colonial student movements of the 1920s to the post Indonesian independence movements of the 1950s down to the present. By focusing on the claims and contentious identities of the study movement and of the student movements, this study reorients the study of Indonesian student activism from analysis of protest to the analysis of the specific spaces created through their reliance on the powerful narratives that shaped each decade of student activism.",1018715679,,Dissertations & Theses," Sapiie, StephanieSapiieStephanieSapiie, Stephanie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2679436111 , 68147552 , 66569 , 9781267346896 , 3508858 , 3508858", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267346896, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018715679?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education"," Asian Studies , Pacific Rim Studies , Political science , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Collective identity , Indonesia , Political activism , University students , West Java",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Free+spaces%2C+collective+identity+and+political+consciousness%3A+Student+activism+and+repression+on+West+Java%2C+Indonesia%2C+1920%E2%80%931979&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sapiie%2C+Stephanie&amp;isbn=9781267346896&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"501,"Solidarity at the Margins: Literature, Film, and Justice in Neoliberal Argentina, Brazil and Chile","This dissertation investigates literature and film of post-dictatorship Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Certain political continuities and the implementation of neoliberal economic policies by transitional regimes, as well as the discrediting of leftist projects with the fall of the Soviet Union, left the opposition to these policies with few political alternatives. Although the severity and posterior influence of each country's dictatorship differed, many novels and films of the 1980s and 1990s reconstruct space in such a way that social ""others"" experience restricted movement or limited possibilities to act. Writers represent spaces in which marginalized characters operate as a labyrinth, as places physically removed from mainstream society, as racially separate, or as seemingly inescapable. In addition to the role of national politics and economics, international intervention plays a large part in the creation of restricting marginalized spaces. I argue that even as these works represent constrictive marginalized spaces, they also construct possibilities for social justice through bonds of solidarity that certain socially marginalized characters form with one another. Solidarity takes the form of communication, building relationships, sharing resources and, in its most developed form in the novels and films, political mobilization. I show how solidarity between characters must be intentional, as well as between society's marginalized as opposed to solely collaboration with an intellectual vanguard, in order to have the possibility of successful enactment of social justice. Together, these works call for a raised awareness of political, social and economic oppression even as proponents of the neoliberal model hail the economy as the way to access social incorporation. In a time period when there appeared to be few alternatives, these works suggest that a more equal distribution of wealth, resources and political power is not only possible, but that the potential lies within marginalized sectors in solidarity with each other.",1019966362,,Dissertations & Theses," Daniels, Jennie IreneDanielsIreneJennieDaniels, Jennie Irene",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2684762561 , 69377742 , 66569 , 9781267361363 , 3509565 , 3509565", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267361363, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1019966362?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies"," Latin American literature , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Marginalization , Neoliberalism , Post-dictatorship , Solidarity , Southern Cone",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solidarity+at+the+Margins%3A+Literature%2C+Film%2C+and+Justice+in+Neoliberal+Argentina%2C+Brazil+and+Chile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Daniels%2C+Jennie+Irene&amp;isbn=9781267361363&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"502,Crisis management by social movements: Learning from Indian microfinance,"In October 2010, the state government of Andhra Pradesh issued an ordinance prohibiting microfinance institutions from distributing and collecting loans following allegations that over-indebtedness and coercive loan recovery tactics were causing borrower suicides. While no evidence substantiating a link between microfinance and borrower suicide has been provided, an anti-microfinance movement across India developed with clients reneging on their loans. Indian microfinance risked insolvency and the once lauded poverty alleviating movement was perceived as a villain by the international community. Microfinance was in crisis. How a social movement such as microfinance responds to a crisis is an understudied topic in social movement literature. By contrast, crisis management is an extensively analyzed topic in business literature. This thesis aims to develop five broad crisis managing concepts from this business literature and probe them in the case of Indian microfinance. The five concepts probed include: denial, retaliation, purification, reform, and re-authentication. All five tactics were observed to occur. This thesis concludes with two findings. First, social movement crisis management is an area primed for future research. Second, this research needs to be applied to other social movements in crisis to eventually develop a model that explains how social movements respond and should respond to crises.",1021051277,,Dissertations & Theses," Pickup, AndrewPickupAndrewPickup, Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2691335711 , 63729641 , 66569 , 9781267370679 , 1511544 , 1511544", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267370679, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1021051277?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Crisis management , India , Microfinance , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crisis+management+by+social+movements%3A+Learning+from+Indian+microfinance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pickup%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781267370679&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"503,Two roads to safety: The Central America human rights movement in the United States,"This dissertation examines the efforts of three US NGOs to defend human rights in Central America in the 1980s. It analyzes the campaigns of Amnesty International USA, the National Lawyers Guild, and the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, and compares their goals, methods, and effectiveness in protecting Central American human rights. By analyzing the ways in which the NGOs ameliorated the effects of human rights violations in Central America, primarily through their refugee assistance programs, it demonstrates that the movement had a more positive influence on human rights than is generally reflected in the existing literature. This narrative shows how the movement opened two roads to safety for Central Americans suffering human rights abuses in the 1980s. The first was to try to alter the United States' policy towards Central America, as that nation was providing invaluable material, financial, and technical support to the Central American forces primarily responsible for the human rights catastrophe in the 1980s. The movement hoped that, by eliminating US support to those forces, it would stop the abuses plaguing the region. This dissertation affirms that the results of this preventative track were, at best, ambivalent, as it failed to prevent the United States from withdrawing significant support to abusive forces. The second road - which is almost invisible in the existing literature - was to protect Central American refugees, primarily in the United States, from refoulement. Returned refugees were almost always the victims of abuse; by preventing their refoulement, mainly through pro bono legal efforts, the movement probably saved thousands of lives. This dissertation examines how the three NGOs under study participated in both the preventative and ameliorative tracks of the movement, and the political, legal, and social reasons why the second track was more unambiguously successful than the first.",1023130544,,Dissertations & Theses," Bassano, DavidBassanoDavidBassano, David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2701948341 , 70204682 , 66569 , 9781267397539 , 3511673 , 3511673", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267397539, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1023130544?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations",," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," Latin American history , International Relations"," Social sciences , Activism , Human rights , International relations , Non-governmental organizations , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Two+roads+to+safety%3A+The+Central+America+human+rights+movement+in+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bassano%2C+David&amp;isbn=9781267397539&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"504,"The military, economy and the state: A new international system analysis","In this dissertation, I outline a theoretical justification for a new world systems analysis in order to understand economic development and underdevelopment, and stratification systems that emerge within nation states because of their global social location. I present my detailed case for amending Wallerstein's World-Systems Analysis by empirically incorporating the interplay of the military, economy and state as opposed to his primarily economic division of labor that defines the core, periphery and semi periphery. I do this by uncovering the latent structure of militarization and its articulation within the world system controlling for state strength. I also outline the basic profile of my Militarized International System (MIS) model based on an extension of C. Wright Mills' Power Elite (1956) thesis and empirically develop the model using a militarized division of labor. With data on 173 nation states, I validate my model through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate OLS regression. I also outline a theoretical articulation of class, race and gender stratification in the world system informed by the empirical findings. In the end, I make suggestions for ""undoing"" stratification to inform movements seeking social justice based upon the world-systemic nature of global stratification, where stratification in its articulation cannot be localized and therefore cannot be ""fixed"" locally within particular nation states.",1027417963,,Dissertations & Theses," Asadi, Muhammed A.AsadiA.MuhammedAsadi, Muhammed A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2718417631 , 70718252 , 66569 , 9781267445629 , 3513926 , 3513926", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267445629, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027417963?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0750 Military studies"," 0700 Social structure , 0750 Military studies"," 0700 Social structure , 0750 Military studies",," 0700 Social structure , 0750 Military studies"," Social structure , Military studies"," Social sciences , Development , Militarization , Stratification , War , World systems",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+military%2C+economy+and+the+state%3A+A+new+international+system+analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Asadi%2C+Muhammed+A.&amp;isbn=9781267445629&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"505,To have done with finitude: Transnational Mexican narrative after 1968,"In this dissertation, I analyze works by three transnational Mexican novelists: Los detectives salvajes (2000) by Roberto Bolaño, Héroes convocados: manual para tomar el poder (1982) and the Héctor Belascoarán Shayne series (1976–1993) by Paco Ignacio Taibo II, and El amante de Janis Joplin (2001) by Élmer Mendoza. These novels, in their thematic focus on the aftermath of the period of global artistic and political upheaval in and around 1968, address the question of what remains of innovative ruptures in politics and the arts after such ruptures have ended. Chapter one, ""Beyond Finitude: Towards a New Theory of Reading,"" foregrounds the analysis of a number of post-1968 Mexican novels through an examination of several prominent critical themes within Latin American literary studies, focusing in particular on themes that reflect on the end of popular social movements. This introductory chapter takes as one of its tasks a reconfiguration of the subject of literature in general, insofar as it elaborates a theory of infinite literary subjectivity. I show that this transfinite conceptualization of the literary subject results from a rupture in the finite field of literature itself, a rupture that expresses the transtemporal and thus infinite quality of that which breaks from its finite conditions. In the context of Mexico in 1968, this infinite expression is nothing more than the universal demand for democracy taken up by students and workers. Ultimately, this chapter insists on promoting new ways of reading Mexican narrative in the aftermath of the end of the student-popular movement precisely because of the ways in which the constellation of social, political, and artistic thought was fundamentally altered by the events of 1968 in Mexico, as well as elsewhere around the globe. Chapter two, ""The Time of the Avant-Gardes: Roberto Bolaño's Los detectives salvajes ,"" examines Roberto Bolaño's Los detectives salvajes , a narrative that follows a small group of Mexican avant-garde poets from 1976 to 1996. At stake in Bolaño's novel is the representation of the interrupted continuity between vanguard artistic movements within the narrative framework of the novel. Although both the historical and neo-avant-gardes of 20th-century Mexican poetry are presented in Los detectives salvajes as fixed and ultimately failed historical specificities, the novel in fact challenges the perceived stability of avant-garde temporality, using the protagonists' search for the avant-garde ""founding mother"" poet Cesárea Tinajero to reconceptualize the relation of time and artistic subjectivity. I analyze Bolaño's novel to demonstrate not only the way it rethinks the status of transnational Latin American artists in the post-1968 era, but also to show that the novel explores new considerations of avant-garde temporality that allow the reader to question conventional narratives of artistic innovation in general. Chapter three, ""Ethics, Politics, and Violence: Elmer Mendoza's Narco-Literature,"" examines the cultural mediation of violence in a number of narrative works dealing with the ethical and political consequences of the Mexican drug war as it has developed over the past thirty years. In novels which offer parallel narratives of the armed guerrilla movements of the 1970s and the assassination of presidential candidate Luís Donaldo Colosio in 1994, Mendoza's narco-narratives highlight the violence and corruption which the Mexican state under PRI domination consolidated itself after the student uprising of 1968. I show that Mendoza's work presents a contemporary form of pre-modern Greek tragedy to mediate the realities of post-1968 Mexico during a period in which emancipatory political movements were absent and the one of the primary results of NAFTA and the so-called democratic transition within the Mexican political establishment has been the rise powerful drug cartels which have challenged the state's monopoly on violence. In the tragic narratives of Cada respiro que tomas, Un asesino solitario , and El amante de Janis Joplin , Mendoza's work constitutes a literary attempt to think the interim between periods of militant political subjectivity in the post-1968 era. The final chapter, ""'A Spectre is Haunting Mexico': Paco Ignacio Taibo II and Literary Fidelity,"" analyzes a number of Taibo's novels, placing special emphasis on Héroes convocados and the early books of the Héctor Belascoarán Shayne detective series. These novels depict the various struggles of characters clearly marked by the Mexican student popular movement of 1968 to come to terms and move past the movement's abrupt, violent end. My analysis demonstrates how Taibo's novels utilize the genre of detective fiction to comment upon the disappearance of Mexico's greatest political movement since the Revolution of 1910–1920, and how these texts seek to articulate new political identities within the context of the restoration of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional's political dominance.

This is specially the case in the U.S-Mexico border region, a contested space that manufactures arrays of spatial experiences and a site where local and national lines intersect. This qualitative study adds to a growing body of work in the social sciences that addresses ""locality"" and the construction of belonging in the context of human transnational movement. Through the use of subjective mapping, interviews and a natural experiment, it looks at how transfronterizo children in the San Ysidro-Tijuana border region construct local belonging. The findings show that due to emotional trans-border kinship ties and frequent exposure to places in Tijuana these children construct a translocal sense of belonging made up of interconnected spaces of ""groundedness"" which spans across the national border. This sense of belonging directly impacts their place-identity and consequently the way they perceive and experience their physical world. Furthermore, rather than focusing on the ways in which different types of (adult) politics shape children's experiences, I embrace Norma González' concept of syncretic socialization and examine how transfronterizo children contest, modify and redefine adult discourses and perspectives towards places and people in this border environment (González 2005). The data gathered shows that tranfronterizo children's views contest normalized notions of the political divide and offer an alternative vision that challenges the ideological production of the border as a boundary.",1032542118,,Dissertations & Theses," Gonzalez, Silvia NasheiliGonzalezNasheiliSilviaGonzalez, Silvia Nasheili",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2730330381 , 69093202 , 66569 , 9781267478177 , 1514813 , 1514813", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267478177, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1032542118?accountid=14496, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies,, 0550 Latin American Studies, Latin American Studies," Social sciences , Belonging , Mexican- american children , San ysidro , Transfronterizo families , Translocal , U.s- mexico border",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CEs+el+mismo+lugar%2C+nada+m%C3%A1s+hay+una+l%C3%ADnea%E2%80%9D%3A%0ATranscending+the+Boundary+-+Children%27s+Construction+of+Local+Belonging+in+the+San+Ysidro-Tijuana+Border+region&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gonzalez%2C+Silvia+Nasheili&amp;isbn=9781267478177&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"507,Constructing private social responsibility standards: A social movement's struggle to regulate global capitalism,"In the last several decades, increasing corporate abuses against labor, human rights, and the environment have sparked an explosion in the discourse around what corporations' responsibilities are to society. One form of this discourse has been the production of specific sets of standards by the social responsibility movement to hold businesses accountable to society. While many in the movement continue to target the state to advocate for laws and regulations, the movement has also increasingly targeted corporations directly in an effort to create private standards to which they expect businesses to adhere. Relying on contentious outsider pressure against corporations, advocates work through institutional channels and with corporations to promote social change in a way that traditional social movement theories have largely ignored. This study examines socially responsible investing and social certifications as two particularly important sites for the development of private standards that function outside of the state. Each of these sites are conceptualized as social movement fields in which actors compete to define standards, and which have their own unique rules, opportunities, and constraints. Specifically, I ask: how are private social responsibility standards constructed? Within each field, I draw upon qualitative, in-depth interviews to examine multiple cases, or sets of standards, to understand how advocates translate their expectations into specific standards and what field-level mechanisms shape the standard-setting process. I compare standards across time, and within and across fields to identify causal mechanisms that shape standards in similarly patterned ways. My findings show how power, culture, and institutions shape standards by including or excluding certain criteria and raising or lowering thresholds of socially responsible practices. By examining standard-setting within these fields, we can better understand how meanings are assigned to the different claims of social responsibility, the opportunities and constraints of these fields for the global governance of capitalism, and the relationship between outsider and insider strategies within social movement theory.",1032967030,,Dissertations & Theses," Dean, PaulDeanPaulDean, Paul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2733193101 , 71084642 , 66569 , 9781267480811 , 3517662 , 3517662", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267480811, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1032967030?accountid=14496," 0454 Management , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0454 Management , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0454 Management , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability",," 0454 Management , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," Management , Public policy , Sustainability , Social responsibility , Globalization , Capitalism , Standardization , Studies"," Social sciences , Corporations , Globalization , Governance , Social movements , Social responsibility , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+private+social+responsibility+standards%3A+A+social+movement%27s+struggle+to+regulate+global+capitalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dean%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=9781267480811&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"508,A history of the International Labor Communications Association,"This dissertation examines post-World War II debates within U.S. unions over the role and character of the labor press. I use archival sources and interviews to construct a history of the International Labor Communications Association (ILCA). The AFL-CIO created the ILCA (originally, the International Labor Press Association) in 1956 to strengthen communications with union members and the public. Representing hundreds of publications, the ILCA remains the only national organization of journalists working on behalf of U.S. unions. The debates over the role and character of union media are put in the context of social movement and organization theory. Like most modern social movements, organized labor exists as both a set of bureaucratic institutions and as diffuse agglomerations of individuals struggling against dominant social actors. Policies and practices that prioritize the needs of union organizations and leaders (i.e. tendencies towards ""business unionism"") frequently conflict with the needs and impulses of rank-and-file workers (""social movement unionism""). The debates I examine—a campaign in the 1960s to win AFL-CIO support for community-based labor newspapers; divisions among union editors and leaders in the 1980s and 1990s over the use of electronic technologies for national public relations instead of local campaigns; a dispute in the late 1990s over editorial freedom for union journalists—express the underlying tensions between business and social-movement unionism. Movements use internal media to create member identities, define opponents, frame issues, and set goals. Debates over the content of movement media and who those media should mobilize are debates over the nature of the movement itself. U.S. unions are shrinking in size and influence. I conclude that union media will be indispensable in any successful effort to spark a new workers' movement. Given the constraints imposed by union leaders on the labor press, however, I conclude that the chances of igniting a new movement will be greatly enhanced if union journalists collaborate outside the current union structures. Digital media and networks of progressive media activists offer unprecedented opportunities for union journalists to communicate with vast numbers of wage earners rapidly, and at relatively low cost.",1033235663,,Dissertations & Theses," Bates, Matthew C.BatesC.MatthewBates, Matthew C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2735001981 , 71057332 , 66569 , 9781267480514 , 3517636 , 3517636", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267480514, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1033235663?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0391 Journalism , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0391 Journalism , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure",," 0391 Journalism , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," Journalism , Modern history , Social structure"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , International Labor Communications Association , Journalism , Labor , Media , Movements , Social , Unions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+history+of+the+International+Labor+Communications+Association&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bates%2C+Matthew+C.&amp;isbn=9781267480514&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"509,Documenting dissent: How Global Justice Movement documentaries encourage righteous indignation,"What emotional messages are present in Global Justice Movement (GJM) framing? What framing strategies are employed within activist-generated GJM documentaries to construct sides surrounding issues? How do these films express emotions to inspire mobilization? Although scholars recognize emotion as a key component of social movement framing that motivates participation, few empirical studies have analyzed movement frames with an eye toward emotional messages located within them. This dissertation addresses this issue in an empirical study on data from nineteen GJM activist-created documentaries that have been utilized in recruitment. The findings explicate instances of narrative emotional framing, which I define as the use of narrative techniques to invoke frames and emotional orientations that support movement aims. Specifically, I demonstrate how GJM documentaries engage in characterization of victims, villains, and heroes to conjure emotions of sympathy, anger and pride, respectively. This emotional blend, in turn, promotes righteous indignation toward corporate financial control of Third World nations. This project contributes to research linking framing, narrative and emotions by providing an ethnographic analysis that outlines how emotional orientations are called upon within GJM documentaries.

Particular nation-states and international spaces (UN, ICC, WTO, etc.) are ill-equipped to remedy these issues. Consequently, in recent years global social justice movements have emerged to address these challenges. Social movement scholars have long held that collective identities are crucial to recruiting adherents, sustaining solidarity and social movement cohesion. Therefore, the study of the formation of transnational activist (TNA) collective identities is of enormous importance to understanding the dynamics of emerging global social justice movements. Nonetheless, social movement scholars have generally ignored the specific dynamics of the emotion-laden processes that impel this formation. This dissertation traces the emergence of TNA identities in two distinct spaces. First, through interviews and participant observation, I trace the emergence of TNA identities amongst activists gathered at the World Social Forum. Secondly, I track how international actors collaborating in emotional HIV/AIDS healthwork in Zambia make sense of their identities and follow the factors that impel actors towards more or less activism and/or more or less transnationalism. Comparing and contrasting potential activists and potential transnationalists, I find two emotion-laden processes drive further activism and transnationalism. First, transformative, often painfully emotional, ""catalytic"" experiences often drive potential activists in search of activist organizations and communities. Over time, they begin to immerse themselves in activist circles and increasingly adopt activist identities. Second, early exposure to ""the international"" often drives potential transnationalists to acquire an interest in diverse peoples and cultures. Over time, they seek out this diversity, continually adding to a repertoire of cultural competencies that allow them to act as cultural ""bridges"" or ""translators"". At the far end of these emotion-laden journeys, transnationalists conceive of themselves as inseparable and indivisible from the ""Other"". Furthermore, they often acquire transnational, relational ties and friendships that push them towards greater activism. Consequently, at the far end of these two continua, activist and transnational identities tend to reinforce each other. Lastly, my research suggests that transnational, transcultural ""binding practices"" will be essential in sustaining global social justice movements over time.",1035147217,,Dissertations & Theses," Kohler, Kristopher MichaelKohlerMichaelKristopherKohler, Kristopher Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2745619311 , 70239532 , 66569 , 9781267531636 , 3521723 , 3521723", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267531636, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1035147217?accountid=14496," 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Sub Saharan Africa Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Collective identity , HIV/AIDS NGOs , Nongovernmental organizations , Social movements , Transnationalism , World Social Forum , Zambia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Overcoming+%E2%80%98Other-ness%E2%80%99%3A+A+Comparative+Analysis+of+Transnational+Activist+Collective+Identity+Formation+among+World+Social+Forum+Activists+and+HIV%2FAIDS+Healthworkers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kohler%2C+Kristopher+Michael&amp;isbn=9781267531636&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"511,"Cultivating Early STEM Learners: An Analysis of Mastery Classroom Instructional Practices, Motivation, and Mathematics Achievement in Young Children","According to the 2006 Program for International Assessment (PISA), the United States is behind their international counterparts in the areas of mathematics and science.

In preparing students for a competitive global economy being- driven by advances in STEM fields, we can focus on early learning experiences which contribute to positive motivation patterns that, in turn, lead to positive achievement outcomes. This study examined best practices in mathematics achievement in kindergarten and the influences of these practices in the development of mastery motivation and mathematics achievement utilizing data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) (n=21,000). Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to determine clusters of teacher instructional practices. Results revealed that underlying structures of kindergarten classroom instruction include social constructivism mathematics instructional practices, hands on activities, music and movement practices, and child centered evaluation practices. Results from a latent variable path analysis indicated that social constructivism mathematics practices had a positive influence on mathematics achievement overtime. Hands on instructional practices in mathematics had less of a positive influence on student motivation and achievement across the kindergarten, first grade, and third grade academic years. In addition, student's motivation and mathematics achievement at the start of kindergarten had a significant impact on student motivation and achievement across the kindergarten through third grade academic years. Social constructivism practices play a significant role in mathematics achievement during the early childhood years. Implications for early childhood education and teacher training programs in STEM are discussed.",1036598429,,Dissertations & Theses," Ricks, Elizabeth DanielleRicksDanielleElizabethRicks, Elizabeth Danielle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2747430741 , 70668592 , 66569 , 9781267540652 , 3522180 , 3522180", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267540652, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1036598429?accountid=14496," 0280 Mathematics education , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education , 0525 Educational psychology"," 0280 Mathematics education , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education , 0525 Educational psychology"," 0280 Mathematics education , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education , 0525 Educational psychology",," 0280 Mathematics education , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education , 0525 Educational psychology"," Mathematics education , Early childhood education , Elementary education , Educational psychology"," Education , Achievement , Instruction , Kindergarten , Mathematics , Motivation , STEM , Social constructivism , Young children",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultivating+Early+STEM+Learners%3A+An+Analysis+of+Mastery+Classroom+Instructional+Practices%2C+Motivation%2C+and+Mathematics+Achievement+in+Young+Children&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ricks%2C+Elizabeth+Danielle&amp;isbn=9781267540652&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"512,Geopolitical fractures: Ideological critique of global neoliberal capitalism in World Bank literature,"This dissertation provides an ideological critique of neoliberalism through an analysis of literary narratives by four contemporary novelists: Nuruddin Farah, Helena Viramontes, Mohsin Hamid, and Aravind Adiga. I argue that just as the global uprisings, social struggles, and economic crises we experience in the 21st century have shattered conventional ""doxa"" about political freedom and economic stability, these literary counternarratives aim to intervene in the global hegemonic narratives about what is called development, modernity, and freedom. Moreover, each literary work exposes in this study one or more facet of globally hegemonic discourses by exposing the ideological contradictions between the utopian promises of neoliberalism and the material inequities that it produces. The persistent presence of the violent processes of capital accumulation, privatization, commodification, and financial deregulation works in complete contradiction to the falsely ideological, hegemonic narratives. The latter often falsely claim that such policies are designed for alleviating poverty, promoting development, making social and economic progress, empowering women and marginalized people, and producing equality. But in reality, the global neoliberal promises of development and modernity never fulfill themselves in communities where exclusion, marginalization, and violence are the material conditions and practices of such ideals and promises. This study attempts to place these literary counternarratives from America, Africa, and South Asia in relation to critiques of the broad-ranging International Financial Institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. The specific narratives I study belong to what Amitava Kumar and others have called ""World Bank Literature."" WBL integrates specific fictional worlds in local contexts into the global world of history, politics, and economics and seeks to ""oppose those regimes of knowledge that would keep literature and culture sealed from the issues of economics and activism"" (Kumar, World Bank xix). I argue that these authors, like the recent protestors in the streets of cities around the world, insist on the importance of activism and the necessity of imagining alternatives where wealth is distributed more equally, where market values are no longer the only values to define social relations, where political movements construct productive collectivities and solidarity for global justice, and where participatory democracy includes and mobilize people.",1037064182,,Dissertations & Theses," Al-Dagamseh, Abdullah Mohammad LafiAl-DagamsehMohammad LafiAbdullahAl-Dagamseh, Abdullah Mohammad Lafi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2748374861 , 69068632 , 66569 , 9781267548283 , 3522611 , 3522611", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267548283, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1037064182?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0601 International Relations , 0616 International law"," Comparative literature , International Relations , International law"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Capitalism , Cultural studies , Global literature , IMF , International Monetary Fund , Literature and language , Neoliberalism , Political economy , World Bank",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Geopolitical+fractures%3A+Ideological+critique+of+global+neoliberal+capitalism+in+World+Bank+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al-Dagamseh%2C+Abdullah+Mohammad+Lafi&amp;isbn=9781267548283&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"513,"Ruptured journeys, ruptured lives: Central American migration, transnational violence, and hope in southern Mexico","This dissertation examines the processes by which Central American women and men face unprecedented forms of violence and exploitation as they migrate through Mexico. Central Americans are regularly subject to abuse, extortion, rape, kidnapping, dismemberment and death as multiple actors profit off of their bodies, labor and lives. In turn, the political economy of violence and security along the migrant journey permeates into local Mexican communities, creating new tensions and social ruptures. Going beyond a simple accounting of abuse, I engage ethnography as a lens through which to understand the social effects of historical and contemporary processes of war, displacement, economic restructuring and social dislocation as people move through local spaces. Throughout the journey, the logics of migration and violence rework social relations based on race, gender and nationality where migrants are both victims of and agents within the often de-humanizing processes of human mobility. I use a lens of gender in particular to understand the ways larger processes impact the intimate spaces of people's lives and the intimate labors they perform as parents, migrants, partners, laborers and activists. I also examine the ways violence is not simply destructive, but also generates new possibilities for solidarity and political action through social movements around humanitarianism and migrant rights. In particular, I examine the emergence of a movement of Catholic-based migrant shelters and a transnational feminist movement of mothers and families of disappeared migrants.",1037816391,,Dissertations & Theses," Vogt, Wendy AlexandraVogtAlexandraWendyVogt, Wendy Alexandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2751647641 , 68125292 , 66569 , 9781267550286 , 3522725 , 3522725", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267550286, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1037816391?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Central America , Gender , Mexico , Mexico and Central America , Migration , Transnational feminisms , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ruptured+journeys%2C+ruptured+lives%3A+Central+American+migration%2C+transnational+violence%2C+and+hope+in+southern+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vogt%2C+Wendy+Alexandra&amp;isbn=9781267550286&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"514,"Flamenco and Transformations of the Cultural Public Sphere in Cuba: Race, Ethnicity, and the Performance of New Hierarchies of Difference, 1989-2009","Since the dismantling of the Eastern socialist bloc, scholars studying the effects of Cuba's new interface with global capitalism have increasingly turned to the field of cultural production as a critical site for examining the changing relationship between the state and society. In this dissertation, I contribute to this body of literature by exploring the relatively understudied flamenco dance movement as an example of a local cultural phenomenon whose foundation was laid within institutional spaces sanctioned and enabled by the state, yet whose development has been squarely situated within transnational and global fields of social power. Drawing on data collected through archival research, participant observation, and interviews with cultural workers in Cuba, as well as the theoretical diacritics of extant literature on cultural globalization, neoliberalism, the state, and performance, I argue that the logics of these processes require we nuance prevailing approaches to state-society relationships and the arts which have hitherto been premised on the idea that the raison d'etre of the public sphere is rational mediation between a sovereign state and its citizenry. For while greater space for cognitive political debate has been granted in the post-Soviet context, a great deal of political negotiation still occurs on an affective level through the circulation of cultural symbols and the performance of cultural repertoires that are not overtly political. In addition, while the state has retained an integral role within the field of cultural production, global market developments, new forms of associative life, and multiple legal regimes have simultaneously produced variegated forms of sovereignty and graduated cultural citizenship in the local context. The resulting cultural publics harnesses quasi-democratic potentials in that they catalyze critical interventions of state power and ideology. Yet they also serve as domains through which groups orchestrate and perform new hierarchies of difference in relationship to state power and to other social formations. Through a segmented analysis of the flamenco movement, I advance a theory of how globalization processes have challenged the underpinnings of the socialist cultural public sphere, giving way to multiple counterpublics of difference. Threaded throughout my analysis of transformations of the cultural public sphere is an examination of how the flamenco dance movement has been depicted as a heretical whitening of Cuban national culture. I correlate this with how Cubans have variously experienced the above-mentioned hierarchies of difference in racialized terms. In charting this, I pull out the contradictory ways in which embodied racial meanings are appropriated and deployed in relationship to various institutional and social processes, all of which complexly-constitute race as a cynosure of performance-based counterpublics. I argue that this must necessarily inform the way we conceptualize the racial subaltern in future studies of Cuban cultural production.",1038156864,,Dissertations & Theses," Booker, Sheriden MartinBookerMartinSheridenBooker, Sheriden Martin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2753762671 , 71557332 , 66569 , 9781267575203 , 3525228 , 3525228", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267575203, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038156864?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," Cultural anthropology , Dance , Caribbean Studies , Latin American Studies , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Cuba , Cultural production , Cultural public sphere , Flamenco , Globalization , Race/class differences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Flamenco+and+Transformations+of+the+Cultural+Public+Sphere+in+Cuba%3A+Race%2C+Ethnicity%2C+and+the+Performance+of+New+Hierarchies+of+Difference%2C+1989-2009&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Booker%2C+Sheriden+Martin&amp;isbn=9781267575203&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"515,"Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union: The formation of new social networks, integration, and activity spaces","From 1976 to 2000, an estimated three quarters of a million Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union immigrated to the United States. These refugees were welcomed by both volunteers and professional aid workers from the American Jewish community who provided food, shelter, and a helping hand in establishing a new life in a new place. Social capital accumulated through membership in a global Jewish identity, both for Soviet and American Jews, provided the foundation for this aid. The shift in identity from “American” or “Russian” to “Jewish” that provided the initial transnational social capital was largely the result of the efforts of the Soviet Jewish Freedom Movement, centered in Cleveland and New York City. Additionally, the descendants of Soviet Jewish refugees appear to be assimilating with native-born populations. Through interviews with Soviet Jewish refugees and other key participants, this dissertation examines the role of place in the shifting identities of Soviet Jewish refugees living in Cleveland. From the evidence gathered through this case study and building on the work of Bourdieu and Lefebvre, this dissertation culminates in the development of a new model of Scalar Assimilation that allows for identity shifts and assimilation processes to simultaneously operate at multiple scales with a variety of outcomes.",1038157163,,Dissertations & Theses," Lake, AdamLakeAdamLake, Adam",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2753742611 , 69092922 , 66569 , 9781267564498 , 3523459 , 3523459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267564498, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038157163?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," Geography , Ethnic studies , Judaic studies"," Social sciences , Assimilation , Immigration , Integration , Refugees , Social networks , Soviet Jewry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jewish+immigrants+from+the+former+Soviet+Union%3A+The+formation+of+new+social+networks%2C+integration%2C+and+activity+spaces&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lake%2C+Adam&amp;isbn=9781267564498&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"516,"From sanitation to climate change: Non-governmental organizations and the framing of environmental concerns in New Delhi, India","In this dissertation I analyse how different kinds of NGOs frame environmental concerns, drawing on theories of political economy of the environment, political ecology of the global South and literature on global funders, NGOs and transnational links. Recognizing that environmental concerns can take a wide variety of forms and foci, I explore the processes through which different NGOs have chosen their focus, organized their projects, and appealed to different publics, hoping to better understand the framing dynamics that lead local organizations committed to environmental issues to pursue remarkably different issues and strategies within the broad environmental movement. For this study, I chose three very different NGOs, each of which targets a different audience: one deals with issues related to India's poorest groups; another targets a middle class urban audience; and the third appeals to a broad global/transnational audience. Through an historical-comparative study of these three organizations, I compared the ways these different organizations framed their environmental concerns. In addition to archival material and formal interviews, I conducted ethnographic research in each organization; participant-observation allowed me to observe the intricate day-to-day happenings and interactions among employees within the organizations. Three overarching points emerge from the study. First, the framing of environmental concerns starts from each NGO's understanding of environmental issues reflected a larger social vision, often shaped both by key staffers' goals, including their awareness of inequalities in society and decisions about the social strata to whom they wish to appeal. Second, the NGOs' choice of foci and shifts in framing often involved strategic choices, as NGOs seek to appeal to chosen audiences, finders and policy makers. Finally, each NGO's evolving strategic approach to environmental issues reflects a complex interplay of organizational dynamics in each NGO, ranging from specific role of the founder, to, donor concerns, to the pressures of economic liberalization and the institutionalization of environmental concerns.",1041098036,,Dissertations & Theses," Priyadarshini, PadmaPriyadarshiniPadmaPriyadarshini, Padma",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2765495591 , 70347472 , 66569 , 9781267588289 , 3528281 , 3528281", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267588289, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1041098036?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Climate Change , Environmental Studies , Public health , Public policy , South Asian Studies , Sanitation , Nongovernmental organizations--NGOs , New Delhi India"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Earth sciences , Environment , Framing of concerns , India , Movements , NGO , Nongovernmental organizations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+sanitation+to+climate+change%3A+Non-governmental+organizations+and+the+framing+of+environmental+concerns+in+New+Delhi%2C+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Priyadarshini%2C+Padma&amp;isbn=9781267588289&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"517,International Social Work: A Situational Analysis of Accredited CSWE Institutions In Mid-Western USA,"The importance of International social work education these days cannot be overstated as social work has been established in nearly every part of the world. Also, globalization has been pivotal as it has facilitated the movement of people, improved technology and other social problems as well. American higher education is challenged to expand and keep in line with developmental trends in the global arena. Thus the social work profession has been affected by global changes and therefore social work education needs to prepare students to meet these demands both within their locales and internationally. Being that social work educators train students by imparting knowledge and professional practice, their responsibilities have increased especially with the introduction of the 2008 Educational Policy on Accreditation Standards (EPAS) by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). Consequently this study was done to explore how deans, professors or those that directly teach international social work prepare students at the master’s level. This qualitative research method using grounded theory was sought to collect data through semi-structured interviews from 14 participants at accredited CSWE institutions in Mid-Western USA. All interviews were taped and subsequently transcribed. As a key component of grounded theory, constant comparisons of data were done during the analysis. Following the data analysis seven themes emerged: Definitions of International Social Work, Funding, Collaboration, Study Abroad and International Field Placements, Textbooks for International Social Work, Tenure and Curriculum Development. The findings revealed variations by accredited CSWE institutions in the Mid-West as they design both the explicit and implicit curriculum outlined by CSWE in the 2008 EPAS. The findings have shown what institutions do in preparing students for international social work and the challenges they encounter. The participants in this study prepare students by infusing international social work topics in their courses, design international social work courses, take students on study abroad trips and facilitate international field placements especially as the Council On Social Work Education 2008 Educational Policy on Accreditation Standards (EPAS) has noted that field education is signature pedagogy of the profession. In the areas of the implicit curriculum participants in this study have created ideal educational environment for the students and diversity issues have been integrated into their missions and infused in some courses as well. The participants also offer students the necessary advisement, as they guide them through the specialization process as a whole. In terms of qualifications, all participants in this study with the exception of one have doctoral degrees and their expertise have been utilized by students as they train to be professional social workers. The participants in this study constitute a formidable manpower in teaching, research and, planning. In terms of challenges nearly all the participants expressed funding problems for international social work as it is at the lower rung of prioritized areas of concentration in the accredited institutions.",1041232495,,Dissertations & Theses," Lamin, Sylvester AmaraLaminAmaraSylvesterLamin, Sylvester Amara",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2766343391 , 71444292 , 66569 , 9781267500267 , 3520716 , 3520716", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267500267, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1041232495?accountid=14496," 0452 Social work , 0745 Higher education"," 0452 Social work , 0745 Higher education"," 0452 Social work , 0745 Higher education",," 0452 Social work , 0745 Higher education"," Social work , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Accredited institutions , Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) , International social work , United States of America",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=International+Social+Work%3A+A+Situational+Analysis+of+Accredited+CSWE+Institutions+In+Mid-Western+USA&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lamin%2C+Sylvester+Amara&amp;isbn=9781267500267&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"518,"The new American conservation movement: New strategies, focus and organizations for the 21st century","This dissertation provides evidence of the emergence of a new conservation movement in the United States. The strategic, tactical and organizational approaches of traditional conservation efforts, which began in the early 1900s, have shifted during the last two decades. Specifically, the new conservation movement is characterized by three distinct changes. First, many of the well-established conservation organizations, such as the Sierra Club and National Audubon Society, have largely abandoned their traditional focus on increasing the number of acres preserved; instead more defensive and fragmented forms of conservation now reign. The second change to the conservation movement involves a dramatic expansion in the portfolio of issues that the social movement addresses; the once tight focus on land preservation has grown to include other issues never before relevant to conservation. The third change that characterizes the new conservation movement is the emergence of a new class of conservation organizations that, retain a focus on securing new acreage protections, but broaden their base for preservation beyond the U.S. to include threatened lands around the globe. As they have developed a distinctly international focus, these new organizations have also embraced alternative tactics. This dissertation establishes that four theories of change, two primary and two supplementary, explain the factors that drove the emergence of the new conservation movement. Shifts in the domestic political opportunities afforded to the movement and its adherents; and the need to adapt to external pressures such as new threats and the emergence of globalization were found to be the primary driving forces behind the three movement changes. Also underlying these changes are efforts to ensure movement and organizational survival stemming from shifts the mobilization of resources and alterations in the lifecycle of social movement organizations. No single theory of change found throughout social movement literature alone adequately explains the emergence of the new conservation movement; all four are needed to explain the transition of this large, complex and institutionalized social movement.",1047346499,,Dissertations & Theses," Northrup, Amy DeannaNorthrupDeannaAmyNorthrup, Amy Deanna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2767588541 , 71647932 , 66569 , 9781267568793 , 3523710 , 3523710", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267568793, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1047346499?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0337 American history , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology"," American history , Environmental Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Advocacy , American conservation movement , Environmental movement , Nonprofit organizations , Preservation , Protected areas , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+new+American+conservation+movement%3A+New+strategies%2C+focus+and+organizations+for+the+21st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Northrup%2C+Amy+Deanna&amp;isbn=9781267568793&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"519,Occupy Oakland Movement: A Logistic Modeling Approach To The Analysis Of A Social Movement,"In the summer of 2011, thousands of people unified and organized to create what is now known as the Occupy movement. To highlight the reckless financial practices that helped create a global economic crisis and a recession that has adversely affected the majority of Americans the movement's first protest took place on Wall Street in New York. Soon after, in cities across the country, people took to city halls and public spaces to join in the protest against economic and social inequalities. The social unrest displayed was an attempt by these protesters to influence government to the changing order of society. This study focuses on a smaller but vociferous and fervent branch of the Occupy movement, Occupy Oakland. The City of Oakland has drawn a substantial amount of attention because of the decisions of its Mayor on how to cope with the protesters and the strength used by law enforcement to clear the encampments. Data were collected using a survey instrument designed to capture people who identify with the Occupy Oakland movement. I aim to convey information about the people involved in the movement by analyzing descriptive statistics under the scope of social movement theories. Moreover, through logistic regression I explore whether ethnicity, employment, gender, education or party affiliation are key indicators for the alignment with the general ideology of this movement, which is to fight for greater social justice and economic equality.",1069260722,,Dissertations & Theses," Martinez, Ronald AlexanderMartinezAlexanderRonaldMartinez, Ronald Alexander",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2769403781 , 68328022 , 66569 , 9781267625113 , 1518854 , 1518854", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267625113, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1069260722?accountid=14496," 0463 Statistics , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0463 Statistics , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0463 Statistics , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0463 Statistics , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Statistics , Political science , Social structure"," Pure sciences , Social sciences , Oakland , Occupy Oakland , Occupy Wall Street , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Occupy+Oakland+Movement%3A+A+Logistic+Modeling+Approach+To+The+Analysis+Of+A+Social+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Martinez%2C+Ronald+Alexander&amp;isbn=9781267625113&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"520,Movement-Countermovement Dynamics in the Global Warming Policy Conflict,"In a provocative paper, Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus (2005) shook the environmental establishment by declaring that environmentalism had died, claiming that the movement pushing for global warming policies had failed because of their framing strategy. A content analysis of pro-global warming policy movement frames deployed in the New York Times from 1981 through 2003 shows support for their claim that the frames were largely technocratic and lacked linkages to larger American values. However, their claim that the movement has framed global warming as solely an environmental problem is not supported by the data. The pro-global warming policy movement first focused their frames on prognostics, or in other words the causes and consequences of the social problem, but after the issue arrived on the international governmental agenda in 1988 the movement’s frames shifted focus to diagnostic frames, or solutions to global warming. Examination of countermovement frames shows that frame debunking fell into two categories: prognostic attacks and diagnostic attacks. The countermovement responded with diagnostic attacks when it mobilized in 1989 and in the 1990s gradually deployed prognostic attacks in equal numbers. Zero-inflated poisson regressions were used to test the sociopolitical factors accounting for frame deployment for both the movement and countermovement. Pro-global warming policy frames were found to increase in response to political threat, elite cues, and weather shocks. In contrast, anti-global warming policy counterframes decreased in response to political allies, election years, weather shocks, and elite cues. The agendas literature describes social problems progressing from the governmental policy agenda then to the media agenda; however I find that global warming media agenda access preceded Congressional agenda access.",1070509283,,Dissertations & Theses," Hein, James EverettHeinEverettJamesHein, James Everett",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2770169081 , 72121272 , 66569 , 9781267580344 , 3528051 , 3528051", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267580344, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1070509283?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure"," Climate Change , Environmental Studies , International Relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Earth sciences , Climate policy , Environmentalism , Global warming , Greenhouse effect , Policy conflict",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Movement-Countermovement+Dynamics+in+the+Global+Warming+Policy+Conflict&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hein%2C+James+Everett&amp;isbn=9781267580344&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"521,The influence of transnational actors on Kenyan environmental NGOs,"As social interactions between individuals and organizations increasingly flow across national borders in a process commonly referred to as globalization, questions remain about the influence of transnational actors, predominantly from the wealthier global North, on domestic actors in developing nations of the global South. World society theory and transnational social movement perspectives argue that the relationship among these actors is growing and is beneficial, with global level actors diffusing legitimated, universal norms, fostering the emergence of civil society in developing countries, and supporting domestic social movements that face resistant states. Others take a more critical perspective seeing transnational actors' power as coercive and suppressing systemic change. In order to explore these types of relationships I interviewed a national sample of 70 Kenyan environmental NGOs (KENGOs). I analyze transnational influence on policy script adoption, the emergence of organizations, and the tactics utilized by KENGOs. Beyond membership in specifically defined international NGOs, funding forms a significant connection between transnational and domestic actors, and funding from particular transnational actors aligns with particular climate change policy script preferences. Additionally, transnational actors help foster the formation of domestic civil society, especially in less democratic regimes. However their support, through funding, is not enough to spur significant growth in the number of organizations—greater political openness is required. Lastly, transnational actors' influence through funding serves as a benign influence on KENGOs' use of disruptive protest, neither discouraging it nor enabling it. Overall, measuring the influence of transnational actors requires greater specificity. This research finds that both the types of actors and the pathways to connection result in different outcomes. Funding, not just membership, connects domestic actors to transnational forces in influential ways—influencing script adoption and amplifying the capacity of emerging of organizations, but not suppressing protest.",1074794420,,Dissertations & Theses," Beer, Christopher ToddBeerToddChristopherBeer, Christopher Todd",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2770767241 , 69985212 , 66569 , 9781267619044 , 3527514 , 3527514", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267619044, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1074794420?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0293 African Studies , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0293 African Studies , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0293 African Studies , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," African Studies , Climate Change , Social structure , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Earth sciences , Climate change , Globalization , Kenya , Nongovernmental organizations , Social movements , Transnational , World society",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+influence+of+transnational+actors+on+Kenyan+environmental+NGOs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Beer%2C+Christopher+Todd&amp;isbn=9781267619044&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"522,Settlement fictions: Global South literature and the postcolonial urban imaginary,"This dissertation traces the emergence of overlooked articulations of the megacity in contemporary postcolonial novels. Representations of non-Western cities and informal settlements or ""slums"" in global popular culture and Anglophone urban commentary enact a series of elisions — making poor women and their economic and social activities invisible, allowing the volatile space of the street to stand in for all noteworthy space, and ignoring the progressive energies of slum-based social movements by equating them with religious extremism and other radicalisms. Postcolonial novelists, this dissertation argues, challenge these elisions by crafting what I term settlement fictions: narratives that foreground the unforeseen intra-community relationships, hidden spaces of work and laboring solidarities, and flexible approaches to spatial politics engendered by impoverished megacity life. Analyzing urban images of the Global South in film, journalism, visual culture, and literature, I suggest that contemporary African, Indian, and Caribbean writers, including Chris Abani, Zakes Mda, Rohinton Mistry, and Patrick Chamoiseau, loosen the bonds that have heretofore tightly associated the imagined megacity with the fate of postcolonial nations embedded in a global system of exploitative capitalism. While recognizing the importance of both neoliberalism and colonialism in shaping modern urbanization, the writers I discuss push critics to see non-Western megacities equally as incubators of original urban social practices. My work draws upon theories of everyday practice, transnational governance, the gendering of postmodern labor, and micro-politics to clarify the local, regional, and global significance of these practices.",1080536547,,Dissertations & Theses," Malcom, Carolyn PatriciaMalcomPatriciaCarolynMalcom, Carolyn Patricia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2771400721 , 72156042 , 66569 , 9781267668714 , 3541026 , 3541026", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267668714, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1080536547?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0316 African literature , 0360 Caribbean literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0316 African literature , 0360 Caribbean literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0316 African literature , 0360 Caribbean literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0316 African literature , 0360 Caribbean literature"," Modern literature , Asian literature , African literature , Caribbean literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Abani, Chris , Chamoiseau, Patrick , Global South , India , Literature , Martinique , Mda, Zakes , Megacity , Mistry, Rohinton , Nigeria , Slum , South Africa , Urban poverty , World Anglophone",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Settlement+fictions%3A+Global+South+literature+and+the+postcolonial+urban+imaginary&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malcom%2C+Carolyn+Patricia&amp;isbn=9781267668714&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"523,From the Law to the Global Market: The Campaign of the U'wa Indigenous People in Colombia (1995–2010),"This dissertation uses the campaign of Colombia's Uwa indigenous people against oil extraction in their land as a case study to understand the impact of the state, the law and the market over the tactics and scale of social movements. It studies how the campaign shifted away from litigation, expanded its scale transnationally and started using the tools available in the global market economy to prevent oil exploration in the Uwa land. The dissertation suggests the need to understand social movement tactics as a complex, multidimensional phenomenon in order to capture the relation between activism and multiple institutions. Finally, it also provides a framework to understand the relation between different tactics and institutions that helps to explain the roles of economic, political, and legal factors in providing the resources and opportunities for tactical innovation and transnational activism.",1080954792,,Dissertations & Theses," Rueda, PabloRuedaPabloRueda, Pablo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2773478251 , 72181982 , 66569 , 9781267605467 , 3526670 , 3526670", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267605467, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1080954792?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Law , Latin American Studies , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Colombia , Globalization , Indigenous movements , Legal mobilization , Market mobilization , Oil , U'wa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+the+Law+to+the+Global+Market%3A+The+Campaign+of+the+U%27wa+Indigenous+People+in+Colombia+%281995%E2%80%932010%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rueda%2C+Pablo&amp;isbn=9781267605467&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"524,Morality and contentious politics in Latin America: Abortion and LGBT rights in Argentina and Mexico,"This study analyzes the factors that have facilitated or hindered liberalization of abortion and same-sex marriage in Argentina and Mexico. In particular, this project will examine the argument that differences in mobilization strategies, available resources, contrasts in framing and patterns of alliances in the political system have played fundamental roles in shaping divergent policy outcomes on these controversial social issues. Against the backdrop of democratization, changes in institutional configurations, and the rising acceptance of sexuality in the context of universal human rights, these policy issues are subject to the contingencies of contentious politics. The argument is twofold: First, international norm diffusion through transnational advocacy networks has had an important impact on the domestic transformation of gender policies (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998; Keck and Sikkink, 1998; Risse and Sikkink, 1999; Risse and Ropp, 1999; Petchesky, 2003; Kollman, 2009). Second, simultaneous domestic mobilizations, which may claim legitimacy from international norms, are constrained by domestic institutions and the legal environment and their strategies for navigating these constraints may yield liberalization if effective alliances are forged to take advantage of open or moderately open political opportunity structures. In short, the argument departs from the premise that ""social movements, organizations, and legal systems are clearly interdependent in a myriad of ways"" (Edelman, Leachman and McAdam, 2010: 668). Based upon this perspective, this study is situated within the growing literature of policymaking analysis of LGBT rights and women's rights. Indeed, this study finds that the articulation of domestic and international contention has created new avenues for demands that were previously unthinkable. Argentina and Mexico show that because of globalization domestic structures are more porous and prone to claims through collective action. In addition, there is a ""growing connection between internal contention and international conflict"" (Tarrow, 2005: 212) that leads to the necessity of looking at the processes and the mechanisms by which transnational activists are able to act domestically.",1095389037,,Dissertations & Theses," Morgenstern, Ana P.MorgensternP.AnaMorgenstern, Ana P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2783453441 , 72990672 , 66569 , 9781267630605 , 3539218 , 3539218", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267630605, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1095389037?accountid=14496," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," GLBT Studies , Latin American Studies , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Abortion , Argentina , Comparative politics of Latin America , Democratization , LGBT politics , Mexico , Policy change , Reproductive rights , Same-sex marriage , Transnational social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Morality+and+contentious+politics+in+Latin+America%3A+Abortion+and+LGBT+rights+in+Argentina+and+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morgenstern%2C+Ana+P.&amp;isbn=9781267630605&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"525,"Remembering and performing history, tradition, and identity: A multi-sensory analysis of &lt;i&gt;Danza Azteca&lt;/i&gt;","This dissertation investigates the production and reception of a modern transnational pan-indigenous ideology and multi-plex identity, through the acquisition of Danza Azteca expressive cultural practices. My research is situated within the Quetzalcoatl-Citlalli Danza Azteca group, based in Sacramento, California. I argue that through the embodied act of dancing, danzantes are able to access, reconstruct, and express socio-historical memories, feelings, and their sense of space and place, effectively creating a Mexica identity and way of life based in a pan-indigenous ideology, a decolonized consciousness. I explore the expressive cultural practices and the processes that each danzante participates in to create this pan-indigenous ideology and identity. I explore the transformative power and habitus of Danza Azteca , an emergent social movement, and I investigate its ability to act as a vehicle for self-representation for individual danzantes as well as the larger Chicana/o and Native communities in which it is situated. Danza encompasses more than just the physical act of dancing. Danzantes are engaged in the movement, music, as well as the multiple visual representations of danza. A danzante may utilize one or more of danza's expressive cultural practices to produce and express the various manifestations of their multi-plex indigenous identities. Danza is seen not as a dance or a religion, it is viewed among the danzantes as a way of life: as prayer, tradition, heritage, history and dancing identity. I argue that through the expression and reception of danza at Danza Azteca dance events, the indigenous ideology acquired, and the expressive cultural practices shared by the danzantes, grant them the power to construct, produce and express a highly politicized pan-indigenous identity. The production of this pan-indigenous identity and ideology confronts past geo-political and ethnic boundaries and is grounded in the specific socio-political relationships the Quetzalcoatl-Citlalli group is embedded in and the corresponding ideology of the Maestro of the Danza group. I explore how the danzantes connect with socio-historical memories via movement, as well as in Danza art vis-`a-vis the images and symbols on their trajes and armas . I show how danzantes employ Nahua art and symbolism as representations of their gendered, social and cultural identity. I focus upon the body as the site where memories are stored, accessed, and expressed. The performance, experience, and reception of dance is a particularly powerful site for the embodiment, expression and reception of identity and memory.",1095389115,,Dissertations & Theses," Castorena, Sohnya SierraCastorenaSierraSohnyaCastorena, Sohnya Sierra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2783453311 , 70075442 , 66569 , 9781267633279 , 3539254 , 3539254", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267633279, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1095389115?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Dance , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Danza Azteca , Identity , Indigenous",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Remembering+and+performing+history%2C+tradition%2C+and+identity%3A%0AA+multi-sensory+analysis+of+Danza+Azteca&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Castorena%2C+Sohnya+Sierra&amp;isbn=9781267633279&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"526,"The Word and the World: The Activist Spirit in American Literature, 1968-1998","In The Word and the World: The Activist Spirit in American Literature , 1968-1998 , I argue that some American authors confronted what Audre Lorde calls the “triumphs and errors” of the 1960s by producing literature that conceptualizes methodologies of resistance within sustainable models of community organization. Instead of succumbing to the inherent cynicism of the postmodern era, this literature encourages readers to adopt activist practices and to remain vigilant against oppressive government actions that intrude on civil liberties. Referring to selective works by Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Norman Mailer, Charles Johnson, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Lorde, among others, I show how these authors—many of whom were shaped by their personal experiences of the sixties—reject naïve idealism while remaining hopeful of the possibility of progressive social change. Accordingly, they offer readers a chance to participate in the spirit of their work by fostering empathic connections with activist characters in worlds meant to serve as models for our own. By advancing a sense of cautious optimism in their work, the authors in this study reclaim the activist spirit of the 1960s while revealing to readers the many ways in which the social movements of the decade were flawed. Taken together, they also reclaim the need for resistance in a post-1960s period in which the gains of the civil rights and women’s movements were met with conservative efforts to brand such resistance as anti-American and social activists as dangerous revolutionaries. The authors I discuss respond to such tactics by defining freedom as a practice, the conscious observance of which is in the service of progressive notions of social democratic governance and human rights. This practice extends to reading as well; as participatory texts, the works in this study command active reading that results in the critical questioning of standard, popular modes of discourse and academic theorizing. How one reads is therefore as important as what one reads, since to read radically is to imagine new ways of approaching the word and the world that account for the needs of marginalized, oppressed peoples as well as the communities we build and the values we promote. This particular group of “activist texts” thus redirects the indeterminate nature of value systems in mainstream postmodern literary and cultural theory to a project that remembers the potential of 1960s organizing—despite its shortcomings—to produce a better world for us all. Drawing from work in literary theory, historiography, cultural studies, and performance studies, my methodology is grounded in an interdisciplinary project that mirrors the inclusive social paradigms of the texts I discuss. Like Marjorie Garber and Elizabeth Ammons, I am involved in literary analysis but incorporate ethical pronouncements that at times take the form of a manifesto for pragmatic literary scholarship. I argue that literary study is often too focused on aesthetic or stylistic value in text and should do more to uncover and promote the value of text in encouraging critical questioning and in shaping civic ideals and expectations. I conclude that locating examples of social praxis in American literature after the 1960s can benefit the efforts of contemporary movements such as Occupy Wall Street as they move forward in addressing the needs of marginalized peoples in the twenty-first century. Lastly, I argue that the relevance of such a project is reaffirmed by the recent turn in literary studies toward work relating to neoliberalism and global capitalism, which threaten to widen the disparities that reproduce inequality and make resistance necessary to human rights and social progress.",1095742248,,Dissertations & Theses," Stupp, Jason M.StuppM.JasonStupp, Jason M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2785956211 , 73052082 , 66569 , 9781267691972 , 3530450 , 3530450", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267691972, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1095742248?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," Modern literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , 1960s , Activism , American literature , Literary criticism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Word+and+the+World%3A+The+Activist+Spirit+in+American+Literature%2C+1968-1998&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stupp%2C+Jason+M.&amp;isbn=9781267691972&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"527,The UNFCCC and Global Climate Justice Activism: Rival Networks and Organizing Cascades,"This dissertation engages the organizing challenges of transnational social movement networks by examining the global climate justice movement (GCJM) mobilized around the UNFCCC negotiations from 2007 through 2010. This project primarily investigates the organizing strategies and dynamics of transnational environmental movement networks seeking to influence the climate change treaty negotiations. First, the analysis investigates the field-level dynamics of social movement networks and their evolution by elaborating on the current and historical political arrangements and power dynamics associated with their relationships to each other as well as the UNFCCC. The focus is placed on three networks in this analysis: Climate Action Network (CAN), Climate Justice Now! (CJN!), and Climate Justice Action (CJA). Then the focus is turned to why groups from developing countries, such as peasant farmers, indigenous groups, and environmental justice organizations, coalesced around Climate Justice Now! and made it a forceful network within the negotiations and on the streets. Field research methods are employed to understand why CJN!, throughout its evolution as a transnational network, used various organizing strategies in response to organizational and political challenges to build trust and solidarity among grassroots groups from the ""Global South."" The project also investigates how certain organizing strategies are related to different organizing dynamics and outcomes over time; in developmental stages or what I term organizing cascades. Findings indicate that Climate Justice Now! was active in facilitating organizing cascades to manage shifts in the UNFCCC political context as well as threats internal to the network to discursive consensus, legitimacy, and resourcing. Organizing cascades are clusters of organizing activities such as organizational decisions, discursive processes, and resourcing strategies that networks strategically facilitate in order to manage organizing challenges. Additionally, organizing cascades are cumulative. In other words, once a network is established decisions and dynamics at one point in time during its development are culmination of decisions and dynamics before that time. An organizing cascade may, on the one hand, confine organizational networks in that they can constrain future activities and opportunities, but on the other hand, decisions made in one cascade may present networks with unexpected organizing and discursive prospects in the future.",1112075093,,Dissertations & Theses," Byrd, Scott C.ByrdC.ScottByrd, Scott C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2788915921 , 73125002 , 66569 , 9781267651129 , 3540309 , 3540309", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267651129, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1112075093?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0404 Climate Change , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0404 Climate Change , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0404 Climate Change , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Climate Change , International Relations , Environmental Justice , Organization Theory , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Earth sciences , Climate change , Environmental , Organizations , Social movements , Transnational movements , United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+UNFCCC+and+Global+Climate+Justice+Activism%3A+Rival+Networks+and+Organizing+Cascades&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Byrd%2C+Scott+C.&amp;isbn=9781267651129&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"528,Liberian clergywomen and the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace: Causal factors for clergywomen's participation or nonparticipation and the impact on clergywomen's leadership in the Liberian Church,"In 2003, thousands of Liberian women participated in a nonviolent protest action named Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace (WOLMAP). This movement gained international credit for its significant role in ending Liberia's fourteen year civil war and the mobilization for the election in 2005 of the first female President of Liberia, Mrs. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Studies indicate that the global Christian church is experiencing a crisis of a lack of transformative leadership to engage the human rights injustices evident on every continent. The Christian Church must provide solutions. Clergywomen in Liberia had to decide the roles to play in helping to end the Liberian civil war. Like women worldwide, they encounter gender discrimination, stereotyping, injustice, and religious discrimination. These inequities pose serious challenges to women's quest for leadership. A close examination of the nonviolent protest action and the role of clergywomen presents the opportunity to determine the theological and psychosocial responses of Liberian clergywomen in such situations. This study evaluated the causal factors for participation or nonparticipation of Liberian clergywomen in the protest action with a view to discovering clergywomen attitudes regarding social activism, their level of leadership in the church, and their influence as community change agents. Twenty-eight Liberian clergywomen participated in this project by providing answers to quantitative and qualitative research instruments. Analysis of the data revealed that clergywomen believed WOLMAP to be a Christian-based religious movement and not a social protest movement. The main reason for clergywomen participation in WOLMAP was their desire for the war to end. Clergywomen were reluctant to participate in WOLMAP due to lack of sufficient information about the leadership and its goals. A key reason for nonparticipation was clergywomen's criticism of Christian and Muslim women practicing spiritual activities together (i.e., fasting and praying). Both participants and nonparticipants believe that WOLMAP influenced the post-2003 rise of clergywomen to leadership within the Liberian church. WOLMAP was credited with inspiring clergywomen to become community leaders, campaign for political office, and engage in social activism, while remaining faithful to their ministry and pastoral calling.",1112850746,,Dissertations & Theses," Cooper, Katurah YorkCooperYorkKaturahCooper, Katurah York",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2792150051 , 73203532 , 66569 , 9781267675026 , 3541381 , 3541381", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267675026, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1112850746?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0293 African Studies , 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," African Studies , Religion , Womens studies , Peace Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Clergywomen , Leadership , Liberia , Liberian women , Non-violent protest , Peace-building , Women clergy , Women leadership",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Liberian+clergywomen+and+the+Women+of+Liberia+Mass+Action+for+Peace%3A+Causal+factors+for+clergywomen%27s+participation+or+nonparticipation+and+the+impact+on+clergywomen%27s+leadership+in+the+Liberian+Church&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cooper%2C+Katurah+York&amp;isbn=9781267675026&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"529,Struggle for Participation — Study on the Election Campaign of Global Fund Country Coordinating Mechanisms in China,"Since Global Fund claimed for expanding public participation in civil society, in the April of 2006 NGOs made allies to launch a movement against the election organized by CCM Secretariat, requiring adding the right of participation and improving election procedures. With qualitative research method, this paper analyzes the reason, process and result including interactions and strategies among participants of this advocacy movement organized by NGOs, providing evidence-based study for employment and adaptation of the social movement theory in China; and makes suggestions for NGOs to expand organization development and political participation in the context of China. This study adopts mobilization structure and political opportunity structure in the theory of social movement as core theoretical framework based on reviewing the background and status quo of AIDS issue in China, the theory and relevant studies of social movement as well as studies on China contentious politics. Findings are as follows: 1. Umbrella organizations, which are of less emphasis in the western studies of social movement, play a key role in CCM election movement mobilization. It increases organizers' overall strength and legitimacy and shows a multi-level structure. 2. CCM election movement allies haven't yet achieved being temporary, proper institutionalized and decentralized, and are converting into ideal external mobilization structure, demonstrating integration among NGOs allies and multi-level umbrella organizations at present. 3. There exists living space for advocacy movements in the context of political environment in China. Organizers are able to detect, interpret, extend political opportunity via exertion of strategies, especially taking advantage of international factor, and, consequently, push the movement forward successfully 4. Four components of political opportunity structure are not equally important. Under the circumstance that the state remains its ability of repression, political elite allies play a more leading role than the access to participation and the stability of ruling alignments and influence profoundly on both process and result of the movement. This paper delineates the mobilization structure of CCM election movement as well as the disadvantages and advantages of organizers, when they were holding political opportunities and taking advantages of them. Allies cross borders are added as a new angle of view to analyze external mobilization structure. International factor is integrated with four components of political opportunity structure to analyze the issue.

Suharto's regime facilitated a massive process of forest exploitation by licensing forest lands to both private and state-owned logging companies as well as to industrial plantation companies. Beginning in the mid 1980s, despite facing heavy political controls over popular social movements, Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) responded to this problem with intensive campaigns against state forest policies and the destructive practices of logging companies (Mayer 1996, Tsing 2005). Most notably, NGOs began to promote community forestry focused on issues of land tenure and resource rights as an alternative to industrial scientific forestry. The Indonesian community forestry movement has formed an arena for emancipatory political struggles not only for rural communities but also for other social groups who have opposed authoritarian rule and the destructive power of capital (Moniaga 1993, Hafild 2005, Tsing et al. 2005). One of the groups involved in the community forestry movement in Indonesia has been the progressive academic forestry scholars. Participation of these scholars marked a critical point since, in general, academics have been associated with the ruling regime, and many of them were the main intellectual actors behind the development of the forestry paradigms that lead to deforestation and its resultant social problems. Despite the prominent contribution of academic forestry scholars in adopting local knowledge into academic forestry, the social possibilities of their work have been largely understudied. Our limited understanding about the relationship between scholars and civil society relates to a more general pattern of analysis of environment and development that positions foresters merely as an apparatus of state power (Dove 1994, Robbins 2003). In Indonesia, however, environmental science and activism have been interconnected and have influenced each other. We normally think that science is supposed to facilitate a direct, unmediated representation of nature. Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholars have demonstrated that the questions scientists ask about nature also reflect their interests as social actors (Hayden 2003). In Indonesia, as elsewhere, scientific knowledge is created by people and institutions with particular situated and partial perspectives (Haraway, 1988, Latour, 1993), and has been critically shaped by histories, as well as domestic and international political, economic, and cultural forces (Shivaramakrishnan 1999). For these reasons, my dissertation project explores how collaborations between academics and social activists have transformed forestry science. Drawing from the theories and methods found within political ecology, social movement theory, and feminist science studies, my dissertation project examines the cultural aspects of collaboration between social movements and forestry science. I also explore the complex and contradictory position of academic foresters in order to understand their social, political, and scholarly framing of forests, how they mediate their political position and ""situated knowledge"" with the state, capital, and social movements, and how this positionality has affected the constitution of community-managed forests as an object of knowledge. Furthermore, I investigate the adoption of gendered local knowledge promoted by and circulated within social movements into academic forestry science, and the possible role of alternative forestry science in shaping social movements. My dissertation research applies a multi-sited ethnographic approach to follow important figures and institutions across scales that are local, national, and transnational in nature. Moving between village level sites of social forestry, academic forestry school institutions, transnational donor institutions, and US-based libraries and academic settings have allowed this study to examine how Indonesian forests are a nexus for social transformation. Specific methods that are adopted include participant-observation, structured and open-ended interviews, and archival research including historical study. The research and writing process of the dissertation also employ a feminist methodology that ties knowledge together with standpoint and subjectivity.",1151137406,,Dissertations & Theses," Siscawati, MiaSiscawatiMiaSiscawati, Mia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2813652511 , 69212312 , 66569 , 9781267698094 , 3542213 , 3542213", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267698094, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1151137406?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0478 Forestry , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0478 Forestry , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0478 Forestry , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0478 Forestry , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0585 Science history , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Forestry , Pacific Rim Studies , Science history , Social structure"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Anthropology of science , Community forestry , Feminist science studies , Indonesia , Scientific forestry , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+Movements+and+Scientific+Forestry%3A+Examining+the+Community+Forestry+Movement+in+Indonesia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Siscawati%2C+Mia&amp;isbn=9781267698094&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"531,"Bombs, Bureaucrats, and Rosary Beads: The United States, the Philippines, and the Making of Global Anti-Communism, 1945–1960","This dissertation examines how the Philippines became the primary postwar site for the development and dissemination of a transnational anti-communist politics. I examine how Philippine elites and their U.S. allies managed local struggles over land reform, armed insurgency, democratic governance, and religion between 1945 and 1960. During the late 1940s and 1950s, U.S. policymakers and Filipino elites developed what they conceived of as exportable models for postcolonial development. They designed projects across a range of social arenas, including military bases, universities, and churches, which were to be implemented in the Philippines and throughout the developing world. These globally charged discourses were formed against such local political movements as the Huk rebellion, which sought to challenge the political, economic, and cultural status quo of the colonial world order. My dissertation considers how these local political struggles, characterized by Filipino leaders and U.S. policymakers as early sites of tension in a global Cold War, were transformed into laboratories for the development of a globally oriented anti-communist movement. Engaging multilingual sources, this dissertation draws from state, military, personal papers, and civic institutional records in the Philippines and the United States. I highlight the ways that Americans and their Filipino allies continually crossed the political borders of the world throughout this era and brought with them an accumulated knowledge of their experiences in the Philippines. My approach is not strictly bound by national boundaries but instead follows actors and events as they traveled widely throughout the postwar period. This methodology, informed by recent trends in transnational and global history, allows me to focus on the ways in which ideas or movements flow through networks of historical actors. It also highlights the ways that the politicized geographic scales of the Cold War resulted, at moments, in contradictory U.S. foreign policy missions. This dissertation thus not only reveals the collaborative constructions of a transnational anti-communist politics, it highlights the deep fissures in postwar U.S. global power.",1151143770,,Dissertations & Theses," Woods, Colleen P.WoodsP.ColleenWoods, Colleen P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2813662191 , 70622302 , 66569 , 9781267710833 , 3530779 , 3530779", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267710833, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1151143770?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0506 World History"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0506 World History"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0506 World History",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0506 World History"," History , American history , World History"," Social sciences , Anticommunism , Cold War , Decolonization , Philippines , U.S. Empire , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bombs%2C+Bureaucrats%2C+and+Rosary+Beads%3A+The+United+States%2C+the+Philippines%2C+and+the+Making+of+Global+Anti-Communism%2C+1945%E2%80%931960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Woods%2C+Colleen+P.&amp;isbn=9781267710833&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"532,The Aesthetics of Revolutionary Nationalism: Narratives of Social Movement in Ethnic American Literature,"“The Aesthetics of Revolutionary Nationalism: Narratives of Social Movement in Ethnic American Literature” shows how writers associated with ethnic nationalist movements in the late twentieth century reconceived the relationship between history, ethnic identity, political subjectivity, and cross-racial collectivity. I focus on a strand of fiction and performance whose ambitious aesthetic aims both work within radical ethnic movements and exceed the identitarian strictures associated with these movements. Black Arts/Black Power, the American Indian Movement (AIM), and the multiethnic Third World Strike were profoundly transnational and cross-racial in their theory and practice, and I show how writers working within and after these movements developed experimental forms and figures that navigate between particular ethnic identities and a universalizable collective political subject. Drawing on a long-standing body of work that has shown the inseparability of politics and aesthetic form, I place revolutionary nationalist aesthetics in dialogue with a recent theoretical tradition that has reimagined universalist politics. My project traces its argument from collaborations between Henry Dumas and Sun Ra, whose play with ontological categories does not easily fit Black Arts's strongly racialized context, through the fraught relationship between Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony and AIM's political theater, to more recent retrospective accounts of nationalist movements by Karen Tei Yamashita and Jamaican novelist and anthropologist Erna Brodber. My first two chapters examine the ways that Sun Ra's 1950s streetcorner leaflets, Dumas's 1960s fiction, and Silko's narratives of natural revolution rework tropes of nature, both in order to revise the ontological ground of identity and to imagine modes of collective being. The second half of my project examines later writers who reclaim earlier movements within contexts of multiculturalism and globalization. I turn to the ways that Brodber uses depictions of spirit possession to revise Marcus Garvey's black nationalism into a model for a radical global subjectivity, and how the formal fragmentation of Yamashita's I Hotel resituates multiethnic subjectivities around their relation to global struggle. I argue that this strand of American literature offers a useful alternative to contemporary multicultural politics by developing an engaged political aesthetics that negotiates between ethnic particularity and a democratic, global commons.",1151451646,,Dissertations & Theses," Ragain, Nathan DaleRagainDaleNathanRagain, Nathan Dale",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2814315791 , 71531062 , 66569 , 9781267723376 , 3531213 , 3531213", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267723376, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1151451646?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," African American Studies , American studies , Black studies , Caribbean literature , American literature , Ethnic studies , Native American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Aesthetics , Brodber, Erna , Contemporary American literature , Dumas, Henry , Ethnic American literature , Jamaica , Nationalist movements , Silko, Leslie Marmon , Sun Ra , Yamashita, Karen Tei",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Aesthetics+of+Revolutionary+Nationalism%3A+Narratives+of+Social+Movement+in+Ethnic+American+Literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ragain%2C+Nathan+Dale&amp;isbn=9781267723376&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"533,The Canadian Liberation Therapy Movement: Mapping the New Terrain of Patient Activism,"This thesis describes a Canadian patient movement—largely comprising multiple sclerosis patients—that has developed around Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) research and treatment, often referred to as Liberation Therapy, currently unavailable in Canada.

They were quick to seize ICTs in the past (printing presses, television, fax machines), which was a major factor in their successes. Mass email campaigns, blogs, their audio- and video- variants (the podcasts and the videocasts), social networks like Facebook and MySpace, and other tools, such as Twitter, are increasingly popular among the movements and their activists. The extremely rapid diffusion of new technologies has raised a lot of questions about their impact on many areas of life from macroeconomic consequences to interpersonal relations, including much comment on their impact on social movements. Social historians are even rethinking the whole history of media. However, up to this point, we have no broad view of how social movement organizations are making use of the media. What types of movements are making use of new media? In what way are they using them and for what purposes? Are they more common in younger organizations, or in organizations that operate on larger geographic scales? Does their use lead to a sense of democratic empowerment? To answer these questions, this study analyzes an internet-based survey of four populations of social movement organizations ranging from the local to the international in geographic scope (four specific populations analyzed are: Pittsburgh (USA), Poland, the international movements, and the movements with high visibility online). This dissertation explores the use (and the non-use) of ICTs in the first broad survey on their use by modern social movements. It provides a broad overview of the movement's demographics (location, range, goal) and their membership (size, activity). It details the diffusion and use of over twenty ICTs, analyzing the success stories of email, static websites, phones and social networking, as well as the relatively poor performance of blogs, podcasts and faxes. Primary research questions revolve around the blurring boundaries between members and non-members (unofficial supporters and volunteers), the use of new media (by whom and for what), and the consequences of those trends (such as opposition to professionalization, or the empowerment of activists).",1222076047,,Dissertations & Theses," Konieczny, PiotrKoniecznyPiotrKonieczny, Piotr",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2832630891 , 72057642 , 66569 , 9781267764614 , 3532879 , 3532879", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267764614, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1222076047?accountid=14496," 0489 Information Technology , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0489 Information Technology , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0489 Information Technology , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0489 Information Technology , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Information Technology , Multimedia Communications , Web Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Communication , Empowerment , ICTS , Information technology , New media , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+modern+information+and+communication+technologies+on+social+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Konieczny%2C+Piotr&amp;isbn=9781267764614&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"535,"“A Consumers' War"": Price Control and Political Consumerism in the United States and Canada during World War II","A Consumers' War analyzes the transnational yet distinct efforts of American and Canadian consumer activists to empower consumers as a pivotal, democratizing force in the political economy of consumer capitalism during and immediately following World War II. Consumer activists—mostly female and middle-class—sought to use the major agencies regulating consumption—the US Office of Price Administration (OPA) and the Canadian Wartime Prices and Trade Board (WPTB)—to mobilize consumer citizens and expand consumers' rights and representation in economic policy-making. The hotly contested efforts of American consumer activists to advance their political consumerist agenda through the Consumer Division and Consumer Advisory Committee of the OPA contrasts with the less controversial experience of Canadian consumer activists in the Consumer Branch of the WPTB. Ironically, consumer activists enjoyed less success in the United States—where activists were drawing on a politically influential pre-war consumer movement and building on New Deal consumer representation precedents—than in Canada, the consumer movement laggard. Yet even in Canada, wartime successes were partial and transitory. In both countries, postwar anticommunist attacks helped discredit the radical consumerist vision of mobilizing consumer citizens as a countervailing power. Drawing on a historical-institutionalist framework, A Consumers' War argues that the most salient factors that explain the different impacts of Canadian and American political consumerism were political. Distinctive political processes and contexts shaped a more favourable outcome for Canadian consumerists. The decentralized, conflict-ridden American political process facilitated right-wing efforts to block consumerist progress, and the US Consumer Division's more radical vision provoked a political backlash from the ascendant anti-New Deal coalition. In contrast, the centralized, decisive Canadian political process gave wartime institutions more definitive powers, which benefitted the WPTB and the Consumer Branch, and the moderate consumerism of the branch—which had close ties to the governing Liberal Party, couched its role in the tradition of middle-class women's activism rather than consumer radicalism, and was less confrontational with business than its American counterparts—provoked little overt political opposition.

But why do some post-conflict states show improvements in women's empowerment while others do not? Using a quantitative analysis and a qualitative analysis, this study shows that the interaction between international actors and domestic women's movements accounts for variation in women's empowerment in post-conflict states. Using an original dataset of 45 low-income and middle-low-income countries, this study shows states that experience civil war are distinctive in their changes in women's empowerment compared to countries that have not experienced internal armed conflict. The quantitative analysis also finds that the interaction between foreign direct assistance and the presence of a domestic women's movement, and factors such as social and cultural institutions have a significant and positive impact on women's empowerment. The qualitative analysis, based on four post-conflict cases—Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Guatemala, and Afghanistan—also shows that the interaction between international actors and strong and autonomous women's movements accounts for variation in women's empowerment.

However, what Facebook actually accomplishes is not as benign as its founder envisions. The social networking site's continual introduction of features that encourage millions of users to share more data about themselves online with an ever-wider network of 'friends' poses an intriguing ethical question: What will be lost if privacy is no longer there? Although the global transparency movement offers benefits to people struggling to obtain greater freedom from oppression in all its forms, it also brings perils, as transparency is used as an instrument of control and power over people. The answer to the question is that without privacy, which is derived from and essential to basic democratic liberties, including freedom of expression and freedom of the press, there is no modulating influence on the disruptive invasions that Facebook and other Internet providers can wreak on personal dignity and autonomy. The European Union approach to privacy illustrates principles that can be applied to restore balance among sometimes competing rights in America, both for individuals and the larger social good. Facebook's radical transparency requires that policymakers adjust the levers among the four ethical constraints that define the Internet, as Lawrence Lessig first identified: law, market forces, social norms, and the architecture, or code. The social goods and individual human flourishing that privacy enables is essential to balancing the panopticon effects of such Web 2.0 practices as data aggregation and storage and data mining. Remedies to restore equilibrium include application of privacy enhancing technologies (PET) to give citizen-consumers tools to better control access to personal information, policies to incentivize Internet businesses, and rules to establish the principles of limited use, expiration dates, contextual integrity and the pluralist social values that will sustain civility and community in the information age.",1242117841,,Dissertations & Theses," Rohrer, Donna W.RohrerW.DonnaRohrer, Donna W.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2847916601 , 69168072 , 66569 , 9781267789457 , 1530447 , 1530447", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267789457, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1242117841?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0646 Web Studies"," 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0646 Web Studies"," 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0646 Web Studies",," 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0646 Web Studies"," Ethics , Information Technology , Web Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , European union , Facebook , Privacy , Public policy , Radical transparency , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Facebook%27s+radical+transparency%3A+The+ethical+implications+for+privacy+in+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rohrer%2C+Donna+W.&amp;isbn=9781267789457&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"539,Net Effect: Social Media as a Catalyst for Political Reform Into the Age of Cyberspace Warfare—Exploring the Revolutionary Narrative of Social Media,"The purpose of this study is to examine if there exists a discrepancy between popular Westernized notions about the role of social media and the notions of those affected by the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009 and assess how this might change the dominant discourse of cyber-utopia. The internet has most certainly transformed our lives in unforeseeable ways having various and unknown shifting effects but the purpose of this research is to view the dominant discourse of liberation in comparison with the perceived meaning and function of the internet and social media within anti-democratic regimes. The awareness of global misconceptions are imperative to move away from the popular norm and scope of research that uses framing tactics of liberation and democratization because the development, adoption and political consequences of any technological tool within any society will always tell a story. The net effect of social media was silenced soon after the Green Revolution and many Iranians are still experiencing the consequences of their actions. The dark side of internet freedom in authoritative governments will assuredly play a role in forming a more comprehensive understanding of the revolutionary narrative that is social media as well as contributing to the overall relationship of how the internet influences the political realm. Iran represents a unique situation to analyze due to its politically closed landscape and historical global misperception about Iranian society and its citizenry. Through the utilization of personal narratives of individual Iranians directly or indirectly involved within the movement and an overview of global trends of suppression of online speech, this research attempts to show that no universal framework exists when it comes to the discourse about social media because the characteristics of a society will ultimately drive the forces that influence technological manifestation.",1268727891,,Dissertations & Theses," Rassti, AfsaniehRasstiAfsaniehRassti, Afsanieh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2862891471 , 74718802 , 66569 , 9781267827319 , 1531203 , 1531203", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267827319, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1268727891?accountid=14496," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0615 Political science"," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0615 Political science"," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0615 Political science",," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0615 Political science"," Multimedia Communications , Political science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Cyberspace warfare , Iran , Political reform , Revolutionary , Social media , Technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Net+Effect%3A+Social+Media+as+a+Catalyst+for+Political+Reform+Into+the+Age+of+Cyberspace+Warfare%E2%80%94Exploring+the+Revolutionary+Narrative+of+Social+Media&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rassti%2C+Afsanieh&amp;isbn=9781267827319&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"540,Waterbirth and Russian-American Exchange: From the Iron Curtain to Facebook,"The doctoral dissertation “Waterbirth and Russian-American Exchange: From the Iron Curtain to Facebook” presents the social history of the Russian waterbirth movement, from the Cold War epoch to the present. One of the first ethnographies to examine Russian-American cultural exchange, this study fills a number of gaps in both Russian and American cultural history, bringing together the issues of religion, science, gender, body politics and the state. By drawing on interviews with Russian and American birth practitioners, as well as participant observation of the birthing practices on both continents, I seek to define their agendas for the development of alternative ideologies and practices, as well as their specific effects, experienced on both global and local scales. In particular, I attempt to problematize the conventional narratives of globalization and biomedicalization, presenting “local” cultures either as passive victims of the dominant Western agent or rebels exercising futile resistance. Despite the turbulent effects of Western intervention into the Russian value system and everyday practices, the local culture of Russia proved capable of producing, promoting, and communicating to the world particular models and schemes that proved to be viable, went global, and affected the vision of the body and self in the Western world. By examining the case of the waterbirth movement, the project seeks to enrich current understanding of the information flows between Russia and the West. By looking at Russian and American utopian projects, which center on science, nature, tradition and globalization, and carefully tracing their sources, origins, mutual impacts and conflicts, we can get a better understanding of the formation and distribution of authoritative knowledge on global and local levels. An empirical study of this specific set of problems is expected to stimulate a valuable insight into the mechanisms governing the relationships between social orders, complex transnational identity formation, and global/local knowledge production in late modern societies.",1272371214,,Dissertations & Theses," Belousova, EkaterinaBelousovaEkaterinaBelousova, Ekaterina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2873809381 , 74526872 , 66569 , 9781267808639 , 3534212 , 3534212", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267808639, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1272371214?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Alternative birth , Childbirth , Globalization , Russia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Waterbirth+and+Russian-American+Exchange%3A++From+the+Iron+Curtain+to+Facebook&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Belousova%2C+Ekaterina&amp;isbn=9781267808639&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"541,Buddhism and Ecology: Case Study of Engaged Buddhism and Humanistic Buddhism,"Buddhism has involved in environmental protection on the local as well as global level.

International concern for the environment is reflected in the many summits designed to bring together world leaders and civil society, such as Rio +20, as well as multinational programs like the United Nations Program to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). Likewise, environmental concern is central to Brazil's policy arena, especially the nation's REDD+ program and policies that define new agrarian reform settlements, both calling for sustainable development. Finally, this environmental rhetoric is also repeated by the landless movements and is made explicit in the development plans created at the settlement level, which systematically outlines programs encouraging diversified production and environmental conservation. However, the reality is that the vast majority of settlers in the Amazon basin are engaged in the cattle economy as opposed to the green alternatives elaborated by policy. Consequently, there is an obvious disconnect between the environmental rhetoric in policies and the material practices of farmers living in the settlements. This is especially problematic because cattle is cited as the main driver of deforestation. So, not only are settlers not engaged in sustainable development as mandated by policy, they have become part of the global cattle economy and, as such, are implicated in tropical deforestation. To understand this disconnect, and the social and environmental implications, this dissertation proposes three main tasks that (1) identify the main factors that motivate settlers to invest in cattle as opposed to diversified activities proposed by policy; (2) examine how engagement in cattle has impacted smallholder well-being; and (3) identify how the insertion of settlers into the global cattle economy has impacted the contentious relationship between small- and largeholders in the Amazon and whether this has mitigated a contentious relationship between smallholders and large ranchers that has led to violent conflicts. To accomplish these objectives, research was conducted in the southeastern region of Pará State, an area that has a history of government-led colonization and development projects as well as entrenched social movement actions inspired to pressure the government to follow through on promises of agrarian reform and settlement formation. This area has also become the most important region in that state for cattle expansion. The research involved (1) interviews with households living in six selected Social Movement Organizations or SMO-led settlements, (2) key informant interviews with social movements, government officials, agronomists, and other settlers, and (3) regional data collection through available databases. Statistical and context analyses were performed to test a suite of related hypotheses. Overall, results show that 71% of settlers have cattle as their main economic activity, with most of them participating in calf production for large ranchers, and credit availability was shown as the main reason for the settlers' decisions regarding economic activities and land use. Finally, results show that the settlers who have cattle are experiencing a better life quality and access to durable goods. However, the evidence was not sufficient to show that involvement in the global cattle economy reduced the contentious relationship between settlers and largeholders that traditionally was intense given the struggle for land in the region.",1282124654,,Dissertations & Theses," Pereira, Ritaumaria de JesusPereirade JesusRitaumariaPereira, Ritaumaria de Jesus",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2876398271 , 70508722 , 66569 , 9781267830760 , 3547947 , 3547947", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267830760, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1282124654?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0474 Environmental management , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0640 Sustainability"," 0366 Geography , 0474 Environmental management , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0640 Sustainability"," 0366 Geography , 0474 Environmental management , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0640 Sustainability",," 0366 Geography , 0474 Environmental management , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0640 Sustainability"," Geography , Environmental management , Agricultural economics , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Agrarian reform , Amazonia , Brazil , Cattle , Credits , Deforestation , Public policies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emergent+cattle+production+chains+in+the+Brazilian+Amazon%3A+National+policies+versus+local+realities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pereira%2C+Ritaumaria+de+Jesus&amp;isbn=9781267830760&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"543,Sacred and Secular Protest in Chinese Diaspora: Falun Gong and the Chinese Democracy Movement,"Why did the Chinese religious group of Falun Gong better mobilize as a transnational protest movement than the Chinese democracy movement? How did Falun Gong's religiosity, its bonds of faith, its ideas about redemptive salvation, and its charismatic basis for action transform an émigré community from authoritarian China into an army of social movement activists? A new understanding of Falun Gong and the Chinese Democracy Movement, or ""Minyun,"" is pursued within a comparative historical framework and a multi-method approach to data, including interpretation of primary source texts, participant-observation field work in the U.S. and Japan, and a quantitative analysis of protest events. The comparison of Falun Gong and Minyun is constructed by drawing on an understanding of social movement activism as a historically particular form of collective action that is associated with democratic politics and is also forbidden in the People's Republic of China. The North American-based diaspora of mainland China, which since 1978 has grown from a mere handful of people to several million inhabitants, provides a setting through which differences between Falun Gong and Minyun protest mobilization can be documented and compared. Although both movements were politically repressed in China, evidence demonstrates that Falun Gong has been better able than Minyun to durably mobilize a constituency across time and place. In addition to this ""quantitative"" difference between the cases, also striking are the ""qualitative"" differences in how each movement enacted protest. I conclude that Falun Gong adopted a form of collective action that better conforms to the ideal type of a ""social movement"" than Minyun, which instead pursued something in the tradition of a tribune. The dissertation provides a historical summary of both movements, a systematic study of their protest practices based on original data compiled by the author with support from the National Science Foundation, and an interpretive analysis of the intersection of religion and social movement activism within Falun Gong. Special attention is given to the ways in which the charismatic religious culture of Falun Gong facilitated its mobilization in the form of a social movement. I also introduce a novel concept, ""charismatic recognition practices,"" to facilitate the use of Max Weber's theory of charisma in empirical research. Although more of the study concerns Falun Gong than Minyun, the comparison shows how historically shaped cultural dynamics from each movement migrated from China into North American-based diaspora and influenced how each movement took shape overseas. For area studies specialists and global sociology, the dissertation offers an original understanding of the diaspora wings of two of the most influential – and most politically repressed – protest movements of reform-era China. For political sociology, the dissertation develops and extends several key concepts of the ""contentious politics"" perspective, including tactical repertoires, the historical specificity of the social movement as a form of collective action, and a relational sociology approach that emphasizes the triadic social dynamics of social movement protest. In addition, the study challenges the rationalist and political economy assumptions that have shaped social movement studies since the 1970s and which have limited the subfield's capacity to integrate religious processes into political analysis. These two cases show that the adoption, or not, of the social movement form of collective action by mainland Chinese activists in diaspora involved more than deploying new tools or learning new practices. Comparing the tactical repertoires of both movements reveals that protest practices themselves express and perform particular relationships of authority between challengers, the public and state actors. For activists coming from a nondemocratic political context, engaging in ""social movement"" activism entails breaking away from existing notions of legitimate political authority – be they ""authoritarian"" or ""traditional"" – in favor of more democratic notions. For reasons unrelated to the ideational content of either movement, the elite Chinese protest practices of diaspora Minyun failed to make this break and thereby inadvertently reproduced traditional (or Chinese socialist) relations of political authority. By comparison, the charismatic practices and group level norms of Falun Gong encouraged a more radical break from socialist Chinese political authority by inventing a protest repertoire that emphasized appealing to the public as a source of power.",1282322111,,Dissertations & Theses," Junker, AndrewJunkerAndrewJunker, Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2877364241 , 71562812 , 66569 , 9781267856463 , 3535366 , 3535366", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267856463, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1282322111?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Religion , Asian Studies , Political science , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Charisma , China , Democracy , Diaspora , Falun Gong , Protest , Religion , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sacred+and+Secular+Protest+in+Chinese+Diaspora%3A+Falun+Gong+and+the+Chinese+Democracy+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Junker%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781267856463&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"544,"Social Change and Documentary Film in Mexico: Violence, Autonomy, and Cultural Production","The use of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media in the Arab Spring, #Occupy Wall Street, and Mexico's #YoSoy132 student movement have all generated excitement about the new uses of digital technology in organized social movements. This dissertation concerns itself with media and social transformation, but recognizes that even as media content can have a deep impact on society and culture, it is ultimately human beings who create and use technology off screen for our own purposes. This dissertation focuses ethnographically on one social movement, the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra (The Peoples' Front in Defense of Land) of San Salvador Atenco on the outskirts of Mexico City, and their relationships with a range of national and international filmmakers. Through examining the daily practices of producing and distributing social documentary films, I show how people used media as an ethical and political practice to purposefully shape and transform face-to-face human relationships. I argue that filmmaking and distributing was one set of practices through which people attempted to cultivate a collectivist disposition called compañerismo, and through which they could build partial autonomies from the state and corporate capitalism. I argue that the historical shift from 'resistance' political practices to 'autonomy' practices represents a significant departure for contemporary transnational social movements, and signifies a trend away from a Marxist tradition of organizing and toward greater articulation with anarchist thinking and organizing. The cultivation of compañerismo is part of this shift and is indicative of a partial relocation of objectives away from institutional, legal, and policy changes and toward personal and collective transformations of self. I argue that the intersection between cultural production and self production is a crucial locus for examining how social movements help to bring about elusive social and cultural changes that exist outside the grasp of legal and institutional frameworks. These arguments build from and contribute to three large bodies of anthropological research: a political anthropology interested in social movements, a visual anthropology interested in media production, and a broad theoretical anthropological interest in transformations of self, society, and culture through practice.",1282654727,,Dissertations & Theses," Stone, Livia KatherineStoneKatherineLiviaStone, Livia Katherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2878725981 , 69041962 , 66569 , 9781267847553 , 3548919 , 3548919", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267847553, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1282654727?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Film studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Film studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Film studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0900 Film studies"," Cultural anthropology , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Documentary films , Human rights , Media , Mexico , Social documentary , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+Change+and+Documentary+Film+in+Mexico%3A+Violence%2C+Autonomy%2C+and+Cultural+Production&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stone%2C+Livia+Katherine&amp;isbn=9781267847553&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"545,"Crowdwork, crisis and convergence: How the connected crowd organizes information during mass disruption events","Social media have experienced widespread adoption in recent years. Though designed and appropriated for a range of purposes, users are consistently turning to these platforms during times of crisis and mass disruption —a term used here to characterize events, including mass emergencies, natural disasters and political protests, that cause significant disruption to normal routines. Social media are playing host to new, digital forms of the social convergence behavior long known to occur in the wake of crisis events. This activity, which includes participation from local citizens, emergency responders, and global onlookers alike, produces huge volumes of data, some with potential value to affected people and responders. It also creates new challenges. Noise, misinformation, lost context and the unstructured nature of social media updates all contribute to an emerging information processing problem, with information seekers forced to ""drink from the firehose"" to identify the data they need. Noting the difficulties of completely solving this problem with purely computational solutions, I address the challenge of processing social media updates into usable information from a perspective that positions the participating crowd as an asset in the effort. At the center of this inquiry is the discovery of an emerging role for remote participants during mass disruption events—that of the digital volunteer. This dissertation consists of four separate studies of digital volunteerism and other forms of remote participation, examining several ways members of the remote crowd help to organize information during mass disruption events. Across the different studies, I employ a mixture of methods, including qualitative and quantitative analysis of large volumes of Twitter data, interviews with digital volunteers, and participant observation within a virtual volunteer organization. Integrating the findings from these separate studies, I introduce a new term, crowdwork, to describe the productive activity of remote participants during mass disruption events. Throughout, this dissertation works to unpack the popular crowdsourcing term, by identifying salient features of crowdwork in this context and comparing those with current understandings of crowdsourcing. Examining the larger ecosystem of digital volunteerism during mass disruption events, I describe crowdwork in this context as a multilevel filtration system, explaining how information is processed through a variety of different activities at different layers within a complex information space that includes crowdworkers, virtual organizations, and social media sites that host both the information and the information processing.

The movements which coalesce on his behalf are international in scope and have become foundations upon which to pitch battles for broader issues of economic and racial justice. Notwithstanding imprisonment, Abu-Jamal has continued his work of advocacy journalism in the form of political commentaries, broadcasted essays and published works. This outpouring of social commentary and academic production provides substance for the movement on his behalf and contributes to the bank of Black political thought. Yet for all the attention Abu-Jamal’s case has provoked, and despite the movements which unite on his behalf, the Free Mumia movement, and the role of Abu-Jamal’s scholarship remain understudied phenomenon. By using the reflections and experiences of thirteen individuals who have participated on campaigns for his freedom, this project identifies the trajectory of Abu-Jamal’s scholarship and explores the relationship between his academic production and the movements on his behalf. It establishes him as an imprisoned radical intellectual whose voice contributes substantively to the formation of our era’s Black radical scholarship and it establishes the Free Mumia movement as a broad based international movement that advances a twin agenda of economic and racial justice.",1283390834,,Dissertations & Theses," Black, JenniferBlackJenniferBlack, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2880647791 , 73320582 , 66569 , 9781267850126 , 3535195 , 3535195", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267850126, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1283390834?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," African American Studies , Black history , Political science , Criminology"," Social sciences , Abu-Jamal, Mumia , Black Panthers , Free Mumia , Political prisoners , Prison-industrial complex , Radicals",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lock+My+Body%2C+Can%27t+Trap+My+Mind%3A+A+Study+of+the+Scholarship+and+Social+Movements+Surrounding+the+Case+of+Imprisoned+Radical+Mumia+Abu-Jamal&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Black%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9781267850126&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"547,Supporting teachers as transformative intellectuals: Participatory action research in human rights education,"Human rights education (HRE) holds the potential for educators to begin an honest dialogue with students and to connect local issues with international struggles for human rights. However, HRE and other teaching approaches that build understanding of systems of power and oppression that lead to human rights violations are not widely embraced in U.S. schools. In this participatory action research (PAR) study, a group of five educators in the San Francisco Bay Area examined the development and implementation of HRE and social justice education. Broad research questions guided the group process, asking how educators engaged with youth about human rights and social justice and how these issues connected to students' lives. The team developed as a community of transformative intellectuals, creating an educational space devoted to critique and social change. Simultaneously each teacher selected an individual research project connected to her own teaching setting. These projects ranged from a classroom human rights blog to a school-wide anti-bullying movement. Research data consisted of transcriptions of monthly team meetings, communications among the research team, researcher reflections, and classroom observations. Emergent themes included the power of PAR as a tool for professional and personal transformation and shared understandings about effective methods of teaching for social change, such as HRE and other approaches. Results highlighted examples of democratic classroom spaces where students discussed and investigated issues that mattered in their own lives, even when the conversations were challenging. This PAR study emphasized the need for teacher inquiry to support changes in practice and transformation of the education system. Teacher researchers confirmed that a supportive team encouraged them to go beyond what they were capable of doing alone. Second, this research established that HRE must be relevant and meaningful to students' lives in order to position youth to become agents of change in their schools, communities, and the world. Finally, the study contributed to conversations on the power of critical, transformative HRE to link local issues with transnational struggles for human rights.",1284826907,,Dissertations & Theses," Hersey, Page ElizabethHerseyElizabethPageHersey, Page Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2885849411 , 75245422 , 66569 , 9781267863638 , 3549767 , 3549767", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267863638, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1284826907?accountid=14496," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0534 Social studies education"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0534 Social studies education"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0534 Social studies education",," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0534 Social studies education"," Multicultural Education , Pedagogy , Social studies education"," Education , Human rights , Human rights education , Participatory action research , Social justice , Teacher inquiry , Transformative education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Supporting+teachers+as+transformative+intellectuals%3A+Participatory+action+research+in+human+rights+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hersey%2C+Page+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781267863638&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"548,"""Every word is a song, every step is a dance"": Participation, agency, and the expression of communal bliss in Hare Krishna festival kirtan","The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement, offers a highly accessible approach to Indian spirituality in contemporary American culture. Among the most intriguing facets of Hare Krishna practice are the prevalence of celebration and the use of activities such as singing, dancing, and feasting as expressions of faith. The dominant musical practice of the Hare Krishna movement is kirtan , the call-and-response performance of sacred devotional chants. According to Hare Krishna belief, kirtan can be a vehicle to spiritual realization and communion with the divine. In the context of public celebration, kirtan may also serve as a performance of the bliss promised by Krishna philosophy and an invitation to listeners to take part. This dissertation examines kirtan as a tool in the mediation of social encounters by considering elements of devotion, participation, and agency in musical performances at four festivals: two Rath Yatra parades in New York City and Los Angeles that take the practices of Krishna worship into public spaces; the Festival of the Holy Name in Alachua, Florida, which involves deep immersion in the process of singing kirtan; and the Festival of Colors in Spanish Fork, Utah, during which a large crowd consisting almost entirely of those not affiliated with the Krishna movement nevertheless gathers to participate in a weekend of Krishna-oriented musicking. I posit that the participatory nature of kirtan as performed in a celebratory context serves to negotiate issues of personal and social identity both within the Krishna movement and in encounters with those outside of it. I further argue that kirtan has the potential to create experiences that are perceived as being personally and spiritually meaningful not only to adherents to Krishna consciousness, but to those who ascribe to differing belief systems but nevertheless find elements of common spiritual experience within the kirtan process.",1287120561,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, SaraBrownSaraBrown, Sara",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2890679641 , 71279232 , 66569 , 9781267885777 , 3551113 , 3551113", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267885777, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1287120561?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music"," Religion , American studies , Music"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Communal bliss , Devotional music , Festivals , Hare Krishna , Kirtan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Every+word+is+a+song%2C+every+step+is+a+dance%22%3A+Participation%2C+agency%2C+and+the+expression+of+communal+bliss+in+Hare+Krishna+festival+kirtan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Sara&amp;isbn=9781267885777&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"549,Intercultural sovereignty: The theory and practice of indigenous social movements,"In 2006 the U'wa people of northeastern Colombia rejected the government's consultation process relative to the planned exploration and exploitation of petroleum located under U'wa ancestral lands because, in their view, the government had no right to the subsoil in the first place. The U'wa claimed sovereignty over the land and subsoil to reject the Colombian state's desire to exploit petroleum for profit. This raises an interesting paradox: how can an indigenous pueblo call for sovereignty from within the jurisdiction of a state? Beyond that, what are the stakes of indigenous sovereignty to global arrangements of power and resource distribution? This dissertation examines U'wa efforts to resist cultural and physical extinction within a context of globalization and on-going civil conflict. What can we learn from this resistance—its persistence, its forms and methods, and its successes and failures? To both pose and answer this and related questions, I draw conceptual and analytical tools from the modernity/coloniality (M/C) research program to develop an intercultural approach that is grounded in the transnational networks that partner with the U'wa struggle. My multi-sited field research includes archival research and participation in organizing processes, interviews, and discussion groups. I argue that intercultural sovereignty, a concept that builds on indigenous conceptualizations of sovereignty, helps make visible how marginalized and colonized peoples move beyond the traditional notion of sovereignty to build self-determination. My research finds that the U'wa build intercultural sovereignty through their relationships of collaboration with outsiders, through the mobilization and redefinition of an international discourse of rights and in cross-border social movement partnerships. This research contributes to academic and activist debates by adopting a decolonial approach that makes visible marginalized knowledges and practices in terms of sovereignty and human rights. Rather than engage a critique of sovereignty internal to Eurocentric modernity, I argue that it would be productive for Political Science to engage with indigenous concepts of sovereignty to address the history and consequences of colonialism and recognize different relations to land. Finally, the long-standing transnational partnerships engaged by the U'wa offer a different, complementary metric for measuring success in transnational advocacy networks.",1287174924,,Dissertations & Theses," Alvarez, Sandra CristinaAlvarezCristinaSandraAlvarez, Sandra Cristina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2890729721 , 68550752 , 66569 , 9781267884381 , 3551008 , 3551008", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267884381, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1287174924?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0740 Native American studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0740 Native American studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0740 Native American studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0740 Native American studies"," Latin American Studies , Political science , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Colombia , Human rights , Intercultural , Social movements , Sovereignty , U'wa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intercultural+sovereignty%3A+The+theory+and+practice+of+indigenous+social+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alvarez%2C+Sandra+Cristina&amp;isbn=9781267884381&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"550,"Media portrayals, migration, and identity of Mongolian ninja miners","Mongolia’s mining sector has boomed over the past twenty years. Along with the growth of formal domestic and foreign-backed gold mining operations an informal, artisanal mining sector has emerged. These ""ninja"" miners (so-called because the plastic pans slung over their backs make them resemble the cartoon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) number around 100,000 and contribute significantly to Mongolia’s rural economy. The ninjas’ informal status, however, contributes to conflict with local authorities, large-scale mining operations, and herders, often centered around land tenure. Based on interviews with aid workers in Mongolia and analysis of international media coverage, population statistics, and existing scholarly literature I examine ninja mining and its contexts in Mongolia and the broader world. First, I use media analysis of international coverage of ninja mining to challenge the framework of ""tradition"" versus ""modernity"" in which the international media typically situates contemporary Mongolia. I suggest that ninja mining—as a break with perceived ""traditional"" occupations yet still ""undeveloped""—does not fit easily within this tradition/modernity binary. Second, I explore Mongolia’s migration history from the Qing-era onward to demonstrate that ninja miners’ migrations constitute a new form of movement within Mongolia. Rural-rural migrations were previously rare in Mongolia, but currently form a major characteristic of migrant ninja miners’ movement as they travel to new mineral discoveries. Finally, I engage in a theoretical discussion of place-based identity, examining Mongolian national and local identities. I suggest that locals (be they herders or ""ninjas,"" or both) claim rights to the land based on their historical and social ties to the community and locality, whereas outsider ""ninja"" groups justify their use by their claim to a common Mongolian nationality. I conclude that ninja mining constitutes a new form of movement and identity in Mongolia which, in turn, constitutes a shift in the ways individual Mongolians claim land. This places migrant ninja miners at odds with local residents, formal mining companies, and the government. Ninja mining did not emerge in isolation, however, and I argue that the national claims to resources made by the latter two groups have contributed to the shifting claims of even some locally-based ninja miners.",1287605778,,Dissertations & Theses," Powell, SusanPowellSusanPowell, Susan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2891745921 , 71529752 , 66569 , 9781267885579 , 1532631 , 1532631", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267885579, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1287605778?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management"," Asian Studies , Geography , Natural Resource Management"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Identity , Land tenure , Media analysis , Migration , Mongolia , Small-scale and artisanal mining",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Media+portrayals%2C+migration%2C+and+identity+of+Mongolian+ninja+miners&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Powell%2C+Susan&amp;isbn=9781267885579&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"551,The politics of the Turkish welfare system transformation in the neoliberal era: Welfare as mobilization and containment,"This dissertation explains the recent transformation of the Turkish welfare system, in which income-based social assistance policies have supplanted employment-based social security policies. This transformation is part of a global neoliberal turn which has replaced the welfare systems of the developmentalist era. Most scholarship, both about Turkey and about other countries, has explained the shift from employment-based to income-based welfare policies as a response to demographic and structural changes including aging populations, the decline in the economic weight of industry, and the informalization of labor. This study acknowledges that structural changes underlie the changes in the Turkish welfare system, but intending to investigate the political causes of the transformation. The main approach of this work is informed by scholars who have argued that during the twentieth century, state authorities expanded welfare provision not so much in response to social needs, but rather in order to contain or mobilize potentially dangerous populations of the formal proletariat. This dissertation shows that employment-based social security in Turkey is being replaced by income based social assistance in part because state authorities now see the informal proletariat as more significant than the formal proletariat as a source of political threat and support. Turkish authorities are shifting welfare provision to the informal proletariat in order to contain and mobilize its grassroots political activism, especially of the Kurdish informal proletarians. The urbanized Kurds are seen as particularly dangerous because many were internally displaced in the 1990s when the Turkish government suppressed an insurgent Kurdish movement. This study contributes to our understanding of recent welfare system transformations in many countries, especially in emerging economies, signaling the development that welfare policy changes are likely a response to the global rise of the informal proletariat as a political power.",1287730024,,Dissertations & Theses," Yoruk, ErdemYorukErdemYoruk, Erdem",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2891806581 , 71623872 , 66569 , 9781267913104 , 3536083 , 3536083", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267913104, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1287730024?accountid=14496," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Middle Eastern Studies , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Kurds , Middle East , Neoliberal , Social movements , Social policy , Turkey , Welfare",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+the+Turkish+welfare+system+transformation+in+the+neoliberal+era%3A+Welfare+as+mobilization+and+containment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yoruk%2C+Erdem&amp;isbn=9781267913104&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"552,The shores of US empire: Islands and geographies of historical struggle in the literary imagination,"This dissertation gathers together 19 th and 20 th century texts produced along the shores of US geo-political expansion across land and sea. Engaging with the fields of transnational American cultural studies and postcolonial studies, this study articulates a transnational reading practice useful for addressing the writers and regions of the American West, the Pacific and the Caribbean in a transnational nexus called the Shores of US Empire. Methodologically inspired by Chinese American author Maxine Hong Kingston and Trinidadian born C.L.R James, the project outlines a practice of reading and writing transnationally that considers US literatures of travel in conversation with contemporary Pacific and Caribbean authors. Chapter one addresses literatures of travel by American authors such as Richard Henry Dana, Jr. and Twain, whose texts, rather than simply being documentary or apologists of US imperial expansion, reflect contact zones of the contested cultural, political and geographical processes of expansion. Chapter two focuses upon the creative literary imagination, looking for other possibilities and alternative epistemologies gleaned from Caribbean and Pacific authors. Drawing from the diverse political, creative and theoretical body of authors of the Spanish and French Caribbean like Martí, Retamar, Cabrera Infante and Carpentier, and Cesaire, Fanon, and Glissant as well as poetic authors from the Anglo-Caribbean like Derek Walcott, John Agard, and novelist Michelle Cliff, Chapter Two of this dissertation proffers a method of poetic historiography attentive to challenging western models of materialist history; the works of these authors provide an alternative historiography at sea in the Caribbean. These texts also critique the production of anthropological knowledge in the Caribbean and Pacific contexts. Chapter three shifts back to the Pacific to look at the military legacy left by US imperial expansion and the social and cultural movements that have emerged to contest the US presence on Pacific shores. I address the contexts of Hawai'i and Bikini Atoll, considering texts by Rodney Morales and Kingston. Overall I argue that Pacific and Caribbean authors bring island geographies to the center of world historical events, challenging the overarching Euro-American myth of island isolation.",1287995806,,Dissertations & Theses," Scheese, Emily A.ScheeseA.EmilyScheese, Emily A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2892717701 , 68478622 , 66569 , 9781267887306 , 3551214 , 3551214", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267887306, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1287995806?accountid=14496," 0356 Literature of Oceania , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0356 Literature of Oceania , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0356 Literature of Oceania , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature",," 0356 Literature of Oceania , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," Literature of Oceania , Caribbean literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , American literature , Caribbean studies , Hawaii Pacific , Postcolonial studies , Travel literature , US empire , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+shores+of+US+empire%3A+Islands+and+geographies+of+historical+struggle+in+the+literary+imagination&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Scheese%2C+Emily+A.&amp;isbn=9781267887306&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"553,"The color line and the class struggle: The Mexican Revolution and convergences of radical internationalism, 1910–1946","The Color Line and the Class Struggle: The Mexican Revolution and Convergences of Radical Internationalism, 1910-1946 seeks to resituate the Mexican Revolution as a center of twentieth-century global radicalism. While much has been made of the influences of the Russian Revolution and Chinese Revolution on radical struggles, this work examines the less well-studied influence of the Mexican Revolution, as the event that inaugurated an alternate anti-racist and anti-imperialist revolutionary trajectory in the twentieth century. The project illuminates the ways in which revolutionaries, particularly those from the world's ""darker nations,"" drew on the history and memory of the Mexican Revolution to produce a form of anti-racist internationalism. It explores how artists, military prisoners, and workers, among others, theorized, dramatized, and challenged racist and gendered social relations under capitalist imperialism and consequently developed new articulations of struggle. Toward this goal it examines what I term convergence spaces, sites where disparate radical traditions were forged into alliances, leading to unique modes of political mobilization and the subsequent creation of new political theory. The project draws on a wide array of materials from national and international archives including prisoner records, oral histories, political tracts, private correspondence, and popular art. By tracing the movement and interaction of social actors through convergence spaces, The Color Line and the Class Struggle offers a historical and spatial analysis of racial capitalism's global development and contestation in the early twentieth century.",1288834945,,Dissertations & Theses," Heatherton, Christina L.HeathertonL.ChristinaHeatherton, Christina L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2895301301 , 75479702 , 66569 , 9781267893192 , 3551489 , 3551489", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267893192, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1288834945?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , Latin American history , Modern history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Capitalist imperialism , Convergence spaces , Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary , Mexican Revolution , Racial capitalism , Social movements , Texas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+color+line+and+the+class+struggle%3A+The+Mexican+Revolution+and+convergences+of+radical+internationalism%2C+1910%E2%80%931946&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heatherton%2C+Christina+L.&amp;isbn=9781267893192&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"554,Friends in all the right places: Social resources and geography in the age of social network sites,"Social network sites (SNSs) such as Facebook connect users to social ties living both near and far. As a result, use of these sites may mitigate the threat geographic distance poses to relationships, and to the social support that these relationships provide. This dissertation asks, in the age of social network sites, are dispersed social networks equally as supportive as local ones? Findings suggest a persistent effect of geographic distance on the maintenance of social ties and on ""social resource"" levels - aid that ties can provide. While SNS use is linked to greater levels of nonmaterial resources, those that may be exchanged by people living far away from one another (e.g. advice), use is not linked to material resources that must be exchanged in-person (e.g. emergency aid). A theory of SNSs' social resource globalizing benefits supported by analyses of survey, interview, and SNS server log data is presented. SNSs help users to maintain geographically diverse and dispersed social resources, functioning as resource banks from which users may withdraw social support. These sites connect users to resources that support geographic movement and a greater awareness of non-local issues and perspectives (i.e., promote ""global fluency""). Though users believe their friend networks to be more local and less geographically diverse than they actually are, certain SNS activities help users to realize the resource ""potential"" in their friend network by increasing the visibility and accessibility of the resources that SNS friends can provide.",1289080068,,Dissertations & Theses," Goulet, Lauren SessionsGouletSessionsLaurenGoulet, Lauren Sessions",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2896571311 , 69767822 , 66569 , 9781267897268 , 3551687 , 3551687", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267897268, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289080068?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Geography , Communication , Web Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Geography , Social capital , Social media , Social network sites , Social networking sites , Social resources , Social support",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Friends+in+all+the+right+places%3A+Social+resources+and+geography+in+the+age+of+social+network+sites&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goulet%2C+Lauren+Sessions&amp;isbn=9781267897268&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"555,Finding common ground: The fair trade and local food movements in Canada,"A report on social consequences of neoliberal trade policies and the commodification of food, and the international efforts of small farmers to counteract the worst of these consequences.

This legitimizes both further incorporation into an asymmetrical global capitalist system, and sanctions draconian policies against social movements dissenting against growing marginalization. Moreover, although the central demand of the APPO movement was to oust then-governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz, their call for a radical transformation of Oaxaca's sociopolitical institutions proposed alternative concepts of democracy espoused by prominent subaltern social movements in Mexico. The APPO's takeover of the capital city of Oaxaca de Juarez presented a crisis of social stability and political legitimacy. Therefore, this project utilizes Robinson's theories of polyarchy and capitalist globalization a theoretical framework to piece together the conjunctures of crises in Oaxaca during and after 2006. Utilizing newspaper articles, primary sources of witnesses during this period, and on-field research conducted in Oaxaca I offer an ethnographic, sociological analysis of the APPO movement and its sociopolitical impact.

I specifically focus on how women professionals from the Czech Republic use migration activities to find belonging, and therefore, self-worth and respect, in different spheres of their lives. I consider this an inquiry into globalization using migration as the lens. Founded on globalization theory, I approach migration, or the movement of people, as yet one more social process that has been transformed in the current era of globalization. I find that large parts of the post-socialist Czech healthcare system retain a culture of disrespect for human dignity that is reflected daily in patient care and co-worker camaraderie, as well as systemically in opportunities for professional development and healthcare financing. Czech recruiters exploit these stagnant conditions and represent international healthcare migration as a means to increased social and financial capital for migrants. Analysis reveals that Czech nurses increasingly take advantage of recruiters's services. Sensing a frustration with the lack of professionalism in the Czech healthcare system, as well as the general status of nurses in the national discourse, I claim that nurses seek migration opportunties as a way to promote personal and professional respect. This is especially evident in levels of self-worth, as demonstrated through increased confidence gained during the pre-migration processing and migration experiences. Although pre-migration training helps to build confidence and worth, individuals are actually transformed into ""global nurses"" capable of success on the global market through experience in that market. Finally, the level of success as a migrant directly correlates to levels of confidence and sense of self-worth, which lead to the ability to more fully participate and feel a sense of belonging in their national and professional communities. The study of Czech nurses who seek another locale in which they can find respect in an environment based on human dignity and professionalism demonstrates the ways that migration and the global economy provide women with opportunities and agency in post-socialist Central Eastern Europe.",1316886513,,Dissertations & Theses," Bludau, Heidi L.BludauL.HeidiBludau, Heidi L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2914985291 , 69338042 , 66569 , 9781267881496 , 3550782 , 3550782", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267881496, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1316886513?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0569 Nursing"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0569 Nursing"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0569 Nursing",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0569 Nursing"," Cultural anthropology , European Studies , Nursing , Global economy , Czech Republic"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Czech Republic , Gender , Globalization , Migration , Nursing , Postsocialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Searching+for+respect%3A+Czech+nurses+in+the+global+economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bludau%2C+Heidi+L.&amp;isbn=9781267881496&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"558,Migrant collectives as new twenty first century transnational movements: The case of the Jamaican Diaspora,"In the past two decades the tendency to view migrant communities as victimized, without agency, or oppressed has been challenged by the new rhetoric of “Diaspora”. The recent formation of Diaspora movements globally suggests that these groups of migrants are not just financial remitters but are organized, visible collectives that influence the geo-political status quo in many ways. Scholars in social and cultural studies grapple with how best to define and understand these revived and reinvented migrant collectives. This case study brings clarifications to current understandings and interpretations of Diasporas. Utilizing qualitative methodology in conjunction with the analytical lenses of social movement theory and the rhetoric of movements, the study addresses the gaps in the literature on Diasporas by exploring the factors that contributed to the formation of the Jamaican Diaspora during the years 1962 to 2011. The results reveal that the unique nexus between the global and local contexts create distinctive “third spaces” out of which Diasporas emerge. This is significant since, traditionally, studies have granted preference to the creation of Diasporas in just the host countries. However, the case of Jamaica illustrates that the occurrences on the local level, in the homeland, are equally important in determining the manner in which Diasporas emerge. One such example is the changing attitudes of the Jamaican government towards its migrant community between 1990 and 2000 which affected the development, recognition and influence of the Jamaican Diaspora. As such, the findings call for a reopening and reconsideration of our understandings of Diasporas as not just transnational entities, but as transnational-national movements encompassing a very nationalistic element. This nationalistic element is evident in the way migrants mobilize around new conceptualizations of their identity, who they are and how they understand their nationality. This (re)created diasporic identity becomes the impetus and fuel for the Diaspora movement. Moving even beyond our conceptualization of movements, this study also connects Diasporas to the notion of publics. Migrant communities, like the Jamaican Diaspora, negotiate global and local terrains, operate as self-organized publics and form new public spaces in which a common identity, goal and imagination connects and motivate strangers.",1316993232,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, NadjaJohnsonNadjaJohnson, Nadja",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2916108441 , 76252572 , 66569 , 9781267948175 , 3536495 , 3536495", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267948175, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1316993232?accountid=14496," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure",," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure"," Caribbean Studies , Communication , Social structure"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Diaspora , Jamaica , Jamaican diaspora , Migrant collectives , Migration , Transnational movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migrant+collectives+as+new+twenty+first+century+transnational+movements%3A+The+case+of+the+Jamaican+Diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Nadja&amp;isbn=9781267948175&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"559,"Social movement momentum, intellectual work and the East Timor independence movement","The purpose of this dissertation is to develop the theoretical concept of social movement momentum by examining the origins, framing strategies, and organizational dynamics of the East Timor transnational social movement. To accomplish this, in-depth interviews of twenty activists and intellectuals involved in the East Timor movement from 1975-1999 were conducted and examined using qualitative data analysis methods. Specifically, comparative historical methods utilizing grounded theory and the phenomenological approach were employed. This study fills a gap in the social movement literature by engaging and expanding the main theoretical debates in sociology over movement mobilization, political outcomes, movement emotions, solidarity, and movement framing. These debates, along with the theoretical concept of social movement momentum as developed in this dissertation, are used to explain and analyze interviewees’ first-hand accounts of the East Timor campaigns. Specifically, framing disputes and turning points, as identified and described by participants, are used to explain the overall sequencing of social movement momentum as it developed in the East Timor movement. Findings include the following: (a) While participants perceived various previously-identified events as turning points for the movement, they also described additional turning points that created the feeling of inevitability of success for movement actors; (b) prior to 1995, there was little agreement regarding the diagnostic framing (problem identification) and prognostic framing (proposed solutions) amongst the challengers, which slowed or prevented momentum; (c) in 1995, intellectuals and activists felt a strong sense of social movement momentum, which manifested itself as a heightened sense that their goals would be attained within a short time; and (d) in 1999, political opportunities opened as the outside world, including some super-powers, became more accessible and sympathetic to the movement. This resulted in a series of successes that represent the peak of the momentum in the East Timor movement. In sum, this study aids researchers in understanding how the successes and failures of social movement activity can be better explained using the theoretical concept of social movement momentum. By analyzing the significance of momentum in a movement post hoc, this study contributes a more nuanced understanding of how social movements create social change.",1316993256,,Dissertations & Theses," Gunderson, ShaneGundersonShaneGunderson, Shane",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2916108431 , 76252572 , 66569 , 9781267948168 , 3536494 , 3536494", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267948168, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1316993256?accountid=14496," 0504 History of Oceania , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0504 History of Oceania , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0504 History of Oceania , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0504 History of Oceania , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," History of Oceania , Pacific Rim Studies , South Asian Studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , East Timor , Framing , Indonesia , Intellectuals , Momentum , Social movements , United Nations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+movement+momentum%2C+intellectual+work+and+the+East+Timor+independence+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gunderson%2C+Shane&amp;isbn=9781267948168&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"560,Linking the transnational and the domestic in social movements: The case of the Latin American women's movement,"The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the international effects on domestic social movements.

I then discuss, with analysis of a longitudinal statistical model, how international NGOs have become important markers of the potential for local movements to protest nonviolently. And I conclude by drawing on an in-depth interview and archival analysis of nonviolent INGOs to explain how they work to expand world cultural modes of claimsmaking.

Music, Mobilization, and Global Engagement: The Case of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers","This dissertation presents a case study of the migrant farmworker movement led by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) in Immokalee, Florida. I conducted an interdisciplinary investigation that brings together the fields of social movements, ethnomusicology, and global studies. The research focuses on the formation and maintenance of ethnically diverse movements, the form and function of music and cultural repertoires in mobilization, and the relationship between local movements and global cultural processes. The movement has achieved remarkable success, as indicated by its interethnic solidarity among workers from Mexico, Guatemala, and Haiti, and its attainment of significant material improvements, including wage increases and improved working conditions. I argue that the movement’s cultural repertoires – such as music programs on CIW’s radio station, Radio Conciencia, and visual arts in Immokalee, and music and theater performances in public protests – were crucial to the movement’s success. Adopting an ethnographic approach, I conducted field research in Immokalee during the 2010-2011 tomato harvest season. I employed several interrelated research methods: interviews, participant observation, archival research, and photography. I also used the methods of ethnomusicology, which included tuning in to Radio Conciencia and performing the Mexican son jarocho tradition in public demonstrations. I found that farmworker unity was achieved through a forthright recognition of ethnic differences, in which ethnic identity took on new meanings to signify membership in an immigrant coalition. This articulation of ethnic identity was often expressed through music and other cultural practices. I also found that CIW’s attainment of material gains, such as a 70 percent wage increase and new rights protections, did not result from an increase in power or changes in federal laws. It was achieved through a strategy that targeted multinational corporations with a human rights framework, bypassing obstacles imposed by the state and relying on the power of legitimacy in the world polity. CIW effectively shamed its adversaries and conferred legitimacy on the movement through vibrant demonstrations filled with music, art, and theater. This study contributes to the study of social movement culture and globalization because it demonstrates how cultural aspects of mobilization can help movements with few resources succeed.",1321489962,,Dissertations & Theses," Soltis, Laura EmikoSoltisEmikoLauraSoltis, Laura Emiko",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2930555081 , 76690792 , 66569 , 9781267971081 , 3555498 , 3555498", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267971081, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1321489962?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0413 Music , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0413 Music , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0413 Music , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Music , Modern history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Coalition of Immokalee Workers , Culture , Ethnomusicology , Farmworker , Globalization , Interethnic , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%21Presente%21+Music%2C+Mobilization%2C+and+Global+Engagement%3A+The+Case+of+the+Coalition+of+Immokalee+Workers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soltis%2C+Laura+Emiko&amp;isbn=9781267971081&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"563,"""Sounds for Adventurous Listeners"": Willis Conover, the Voice of America, and the international reception of avant-garde jazz in the 1960s","In “Sounds for Adventurous Listeners,” I argue that Conover’s role in the dissemination of jazz through the Music USA Jazz Hour was more influential on an educational level than what literature on Conover currently provides. Chapter 2 begins with an examination of current studies regarding the role of jazz in Cold War diplomacy, the sociopolitical implications of avant-garde jazz and race, the convergence of fandom and propaganda, the promoter as facilitator of musical trends, and the influence of international radio during the Cold War. In chapter 3 I introduce the Friends of Music USA Newsletter and explain its function as a record of overseas jazz reception and a document that cohered a global network of fans. I then focus on avant-garde debates of the 1960s and discuss Conover’s role overseas and in the United States. Chapter 4 engages social purpose and jazz criticism in the 1960s. I discuss Conover’s philosophy on social responsibility, and how his contributions intersected with other relevant discourses on race on the eve of the civil rights movement. I argue that Conover embodied two personas: one as jazz critic and promoter in the United States, and the other as an international intermediary. In chapter 5 I discuss how Conover presented the avant-garde to his overseas audience. I argue that through his efforts to broadcast jazz impartially, he legitimized avant-garde and emphasized its qualities as art music. In chapter 6 I explore fandom studies as they apply to the formation of Music USA as a global fan network. I discuss the early roots of Conover’s interest in science fiction fandom as a motivation for the implementation of the Friends of Music USA (FOMUSA) groups. Chapter 7 concludes in a discussion of the deification of Conover though the medium of radio in the midst of the Cold War. I argue that, through manipulation of sound resources, Conover composed his broadcasts in a way that allowed him to improvise creatively. Finally, I discuss the effect of a radio personality on crowds and the impact of Conover’s music programming in light of studies concerning deejays as objects of devotion.",1334925509,,Dissertations & Theses," Breckenridge, Mark A.BreckenridgeA.MarkBreckenridge, Mark A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2951016451 , 74078672 , 66569 , 9781267999078 , 3538081 , 3538081", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267999078, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1334925509?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0451 Social psychology , 0708 Mass communications"," 0413 Music , 0451 Social psychology , 0708 Mass communications"," 0413 Music , 0451 Social psychology , 0708 Mass communications",," 0413 Music , 0451 Social psychology , 0708 Mass communications"," Music , Social psychology , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Psychology , 1960s , Avant-garde , Conover, Willis , Jazz , Radio , Reception , Voice of America",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Sounds+for+Adventurous+Listeners%22%3A+Willis+Conover%2C+the+Voice+of+America%2C+and+the+international+reception+of+avant-garde+jazz+in+the+1960s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Breckenridge%2C+Mark+A.&amp;isbn=9781267999078&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"564,Implementing Preventive Education about HIV/AIDS through Physical Education in Zambia: The Response of Teachers,"Governments, United Nations (UN) agencies and international and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have mounted a concerted effort to remobilize sport as a vehicle for broad, sustainable social development. This resonates with the call by the UN Inter-agency Task Force for sport to be a key component in national and international development objectives. Missing in these efforts is an explicit focus on physical education within state schools, which still enroll most children in the global South. This study focuses on research into one of the few instances where physical education within the national curriculum is being revitalized as part of this growing interest in leveraging the appeal of sport and play as a means to address social development challenges such as HIV/AIDS. The study examines the response to the Zambian government’s 2006 Declaration of Mandatory Physical Education (with a preventive education focus on HIV/AIDS) by personnel charged with its implementation. The decree directed personnel to immediately begin implementing the teaching of physical education in all Basic and Secondary schools in Zambia to “ensure physical fitness and the enhancement of values, skills and holistic development of the learner” (Ministry of Education, 2006). The study examined the response of 17 teachers and education administrators from Lusaka province, Zambia. The interviews were conducted between September and December 2009. The purpose of the study was to: 1) evaluate the implementation of the Presidential Decree on physical education as a strategy for addressing HIV/AIDS through Physical Education and Traditional Zambian Games; 2) explore and understand the response of teachers and administrators to the implementation of the 2006 Presidential Decree on physical education; 3) explore how the school context influences the implementation of the Presidential Decree; and 4) map a critical path of key personnel and their resource requirements, and make recommendations for strengthening the effectiveness of HIV prevention education. Drawing on education policy implementation literature, this study provides an analysis of the rising influence of the sport for development movement and of the ways in which physical education and sport may address HIV/AIDS within national education in Zambia. The findings of the study reveal promising signs for the potential of physical education, and of particularly traditional games, for student engagement and for addressing HIV/AIDS. Yet these promising signs are undermined by poor planning and support from the education bureaucracy, deficiencies that stem from years of neglect of, until recently, non-examinable subjects such as physical education. The findings confirm that the literature on education policy implementation drawn mostly from the global North is just as applicable to education sectors in the global South.",1349630500,,Dissertations & Theses," Njelesani, Donald LesaNjelesaniLesaDonaldNjelesani, Donald Lesa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2965583831 , 76905382 , 66569 , 9780494970676 , NR97067 , NR97067", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494970676, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1349630500?accountid=14496," 0523 Physical education , 0680 Health education"," 0523 Physical education , 0680 Health education"," 0523 Physical education , 0680 Health education",," 0523 Physical education , 0680 Health education"," Physical education , Health education"," Education , AIDS , Education , HIV , Implementation , Physical education , Policy , Preventive education , Sport for development , Teachers , Zambia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Implementing+Preventive+Education+about+HIV%2FAIDS+through+Physical+Education+in+Zambia%3A+The+Response+of+Teachers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Njelesani%2C+Donald+Lesa&amp;isbn=9780494970676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"565,"South Africa in the Changing World Order: Power, Finance and Society","What is the relationship between changes in world order and the organisation of finance in South Africa? And how do we understand these changes theoretically? To answer this question I employ Fernand Braudel's historical method of the study of material civilization—the constraints and possibilities on which the social world is based at any given point in time. This method provides an instructive and original explanation of societies, political power, economic modes of production, and the place that capitalism occupies historically and spatially within these contexts. My dissertation argues that patterns of both continuity and change in the world order are perceptible in South Africa as the country finds itself at the heart of historic shifts in world-economies. Change is observable at the boundaries of world-economies as arrangements in power, trade and investment shift to new political economic centres. South Africa is a zone historically linked to world-economies and reveals these movements. At the same time, global structures ensure continuity, through the power of neoliberal ideology and policies, the international financial institutions set up under American hegemony, the power of the global financial markets, and the enduring power of societal groups with links to transnational capitalism. This interplay between continuity and discontinuity are apparent in national contexts. The goal of this thesis is to study these different dimensions of change and continuity through an exploration of the edges where politics, economy, society, and state meet in post-apartheid South Africa. Looking at these `edges' provides us with evidence and insight about the robustness of capitalism in South Africa and its structural links to world order, or in other words, about its continuity or discontinuity. Investigation of these changes is achieved through applying Braudel's theoretical building blocks of multiple time frames, `world-economy' and the `set of sets,' concepts that unveils the multiplicity and complexity of social orders. Finally, I propose a reengagement with Braudel's thoughts and methods. Braudel's relevance lies in the potential of his theoretical framework to widen and thicken a rather compressed understanding of international political economy.",1367082640,,Dissertations & Theses," Cobbett, ElizabethCobbettElizabethCobbett, Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2994085481 , 71240152 , 66569 , 9780494936627 , NR93662 , NR93662", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494936627, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1367082640?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies"," Political science , International law , South African Studies"," Social sciences , Capitalism , Finance , New world order , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=South+Africa+in+the+Changing+World+Order%3A+Power%2C+Finance+and+Society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cobbett%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780494936627&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"566,Forging the link between faith and development: The history of the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace 1967–1982,"This dissertation is the first historical examination of the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace (CCODP), the official international development organization of the Catholic Church in Canada. Founded in 1967 by the Canadian bishops as a response to the Second Vatican Council's ""The Church in the Modern World"" ( Gaudium et Spes, 1965), Development and Peace was entrusted with a two-fold mandate: to provide financial support for socio-economic development projects in the so-called ""Third World"" (Latin America, Africa, and Asia) and to educate Canadians about the causes of global injustice. After fifteen years of experience, dialogue with local partners, and critical reflection, CCODP experienced a substantial maturation in how it understood its mandate. From 1967 to 1982, Development and Peace was transformed from a seasonal fundraising agency with a paternalistic understanding of economic development into a nationwide democratic movement that facilitated year-round educational campaigns and supported a proactive vision of social, political, economic and cultural development. This dissertation explores the evolution of Development and Peace's understanding of its original mandate across three main themes. First, CCODP's approach to international development slowly advanced beyond providing primarily economic assistance to a program of development that supported social, political, economic and cultural liberation. Fifteen years of field experience taught CCODP that lasting improvement in the Third World could only be achieved through projects that provided skills to members of local communities to take charge of their own lives and press for structural change. Second, Development and Peace expanded its education program from an isolated fundraising experience into an integrated year-long educational enterprise. During these years, the pedagogical approach of CCODP's Canadian education campaign moved from promotion to education to action. Third, Development and Peace spent much time and energy creating a democratic movement of active members across Canada that was empowered to guide the basic principles and orientation of the organization. Drawing theological inspiration from post-conciliar Catholic social teaching ( Populorum Progressio, the Medellín Conference in 1968, and ""Justice in the World""), Development and Peace became an active participant in the liberation of the world through solidarity, structural change and advocacy.",1400008833,,Dissertations & Theses," Baltutis, Peter ErnestBaltutisErnestPeterBaltutis, Peter Ernest",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3019740061 , 80453012 , 66569 , 9780494938164 , NR93816 , NR93816", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494938164, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1400008833?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations"," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations"," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations",," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations"," Religious history , International Relations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace (CCODP) , Faith , International development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Forging+the+link+between+faith+and+development%3A+The+history+of+the+Canadian+Catholic+Organization+for+Development+and+Peace+1967%E2%80%931982&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baltutis%2C+Peter+Ernest&amp;isbn=9780494938164&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"567,"Afro-Colombian and Indigenous social movements: International influences, framing tactics, and state constructed identity","This thesis is a comparative analysis of Afro-Colombian and Indigenous social movements.

The consolidation of each step of food production in the hands of just a few companies has siphoned value and wealth from rural areas, edging out small producers and forcing farmers to becoming a part of the corporate production system. The food sovereignty movement has become one of the most outspoken critics of the globalization of the neoliberal industrial model of agriculture. The development of the global food sovereignty movement over the last two decades constitutes a significant political and social response to the inequalities present in and perpetuated by global food production and distribution systems. Recognizing the growing influence of the food sovereignty movement, this project posits that the movement may be seen as a modern expression of centuries-old debates about political and legal sovereignty. Thus, I attempt to analyze the theorization of the food sovereignty movement in relation to the historical evolution of the concept of sovereignty, and to anticipate what implications the present-day dialogue about sovereignty may have for the ongoing theorization of food sovereignty. A brief overview of the origins and historical development of the political and legal concept of sovereignty provides background for the development of food sovereignty and the political landscape into to which it emerged. Next, an analysis of the public and academic discourse on food sovereignty attempts to discern the “theorization” of the concept through the words and actions of food sovereignty movements, drawing as well on the body of academic work on food sovereignty and the use of the concept in policy and governance. By examining the movement’s self-conception, the political claims and justifications presented, the values system, organizational practices and structures, and forms of social and political action, the way in which the food sovereignty movements of the world have crafted a theory of food sovereignty begins to materialize. This working theory of food sovereignty is then framed in relation to other recent developments within the scholarship and practice of sovereignty, particularly studies of the fragmentation of governance and the international legal concept of permanent sovereignty over natural resources.",1442480190,,Dissertations & Theses," Winsauer, Emily A.WinsauerA.EmilyWinsauer, Emily A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101075951 , 71869552 , 101309 , U598138 , U598138 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/6365", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442480190?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/6365 , (UMI)AAIU598138 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Theorizing+food+sovereignty%3A+an+analysis+of+public+and+academic+discourse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Winsauer%2C+Emily+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"569,"'Civilizing the world': Progressive religion and politics from Chicago to the Middle East, 1890-1925","My dissertation analyzes “practical Christians,” a network of activists in Chicago whose dedication to domestic and international social reform arose from a shared commitment to non-sectarian Christian cooperation and the exercise of Christian citizenship. Practical Christians pursued reform in order to fight the threat of the Chicago Democrat machine, radical labor, and unassimilated immigrants. Bringing together a diverse coalition of liberal Protestants, revivalists, evangelicals, and ‘secular’ reformers, practical Christians’ rejected theological divisions in favor of broad alliances committed to improving society at home and abroad. I argue that a proper understanding of the intimate relationship between local and global activism provides new insight into the social networks, political goals, religious identities, and international outlook of practical Christians. While the contributions of the Social Gospel movement to Progressive Era reform has been documented, Chicago’s dynamic reform community reveals another religious reform network that is not to be confused with the Social Gospel. My dissertation departs from current interpretations of the Progressive Era with its analysis of domestic and international social work and the integral role that practical Christians played in this global vision for transforming the world. This broad reform alliance considered their domestic and global reforms as seamless tasks in modernizing the world. I follow the pathways of practical Christian reform from Chicago to Turkey, where American missionaries and philanthropists provided disaster relief for Armenians as they suffered considerable violence from the 1890s-1920s. Just as Chicago practical Christians labored to civilize their immigrant neighbors and encourage their adoption of Christian and American habits, Americans worked to Christianize and modernize Armenians and the Middle East. This activism through foreign missions helped fuel American imperialism in the early twentieth century. The practical Christian coalition faltered post-World War I as evangelicals continued to privilege the perceived Christian and religious components of American middle-class respectability locally and globally.

While a number of factors contributed to success and failure of the movements, the use of different strategies and communication media contributed to one movement being more successful than the other. This dissertation examines the role of international and national civil society on the different outcomes of these social movements and the role the media played as a catalyst in social movement activism. A comparative and historical research approach was used to study these two social movements. The specific research methods included collecting data through personal interviews and finding movement documents and Internet communiqués. These materials were analyzed using Johnston's micro-discourse analysis of text. The overall study was framed in Mills' method of difference. I conclude that the Zapatista movement in Mexico was more successful than the Narmada Dam movement in India for two main reasons. First, the Zapatista movement in Mexico was successful because it used strategic communication through a range of media including the Internet to rapidly disseminate the Zapatista message in dramatic fashion across the world. In contrast, the Narmada Dam movement in India was less successful with its strategic communications and was not able to activate international civil society concerning their message. Much of this was because they did not use the Internet effectively. Second, the Zapatista movement in Mexico was more successful in connecting to the national and the international civil society and forming strong transnational coalitions. The Narmada Dam movement in India did not form strong transnational alliances in national and international civil society.

Very brief exposures or ‘thin slices’ of behavioural and linguistic information are sufficient for making accurate judgments regarding social situations and building these social representations. This is akin to our accurate recognition of static visual stimuli with brief exposures to a scene in the study of scene gist (Oliva, 2005). This thesis examines a specific social cue during social interaction—how the correlation of movement between two people varies as a result of their affiliation. Further, this thesis investigates how we perceive that behavioural cue when making judgments of affiliation while observing conversation. It has already been established that there is coordination of linguistic and behavioural information during social interaction (Ambady &amp; Rosenthal, 1992). This coordination is more prominent when individuals are familiar with each than when they are not (Dunne &amp; Ng, 1994). The first study in this thesis quantifies the variation in the coordination of movement between two people in conversation based on their affiliation. Results demonstrate that the correlation of movements between friends is greater than the correlation during stranger interaction. This experiment demonstrates that movement varies as a result of affiliation and that people could use this coordination as a cue when making accurate judgments of affiliation while observing social interaction. The second study used the analysis of movement correlation to examine how correlation serves as a cue for accuracy of affiliation judgment by observers. Results demonstrate that although correlation was not a significant cue in affiliation perception, participants could indeed do the perceptual task. These results suggest that the perception of social information is multi-faceted and many cues contribute to its perception. These findings are discussed in terms of our sensitivity to more specific movement correlations as opposed to the global correlations used in this study. These studies highlight the need for further investigation in how behavioural cues function within the judgment of social information.",1512217339,,Dissertations & Theses," Latif, NidaLatifNidaLatif, Nida",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264222471 , 86538212 , 66569 , 9780499255396 , MS25539 , MS25539", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780499255396, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512217339?accountid=14496, 0623 Experimental psychology, 0623 Experimental psychology, 0623 Experimental psychology,, 0623 Experimental psychology, Experimental psychology," Psychology , Nonverbal communication , Social perception , Social visual-cognition",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Movement+correlation+as+a+nonverbal+cue+in+the+perception+of+affiliation+in+thin+slices+of+behaviour&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Latif%2C+Nida&amp;isbn=9780499255396&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"572,Challenges and opportunities for the national constitutional system in dealing with the global investment regime: a case study of the indirect expropriation doctrine and investor-state arbitration under the free trade agreement between the republic of korea and the united states of america,"In 2011, Korea ratified the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KORUS-FTA). This treaty remains controversial in Korean society, particularly because many Koreans claim that the indirect expropriation doctrine under investor-state arbitration in the investment chapter will allow global investors to challenge governmental regulation justified by the Korean constitution. Despite such criticism, the KORUS-FTA indirect expropriation doctrine and the Korean constitutional property doctrine share more than might be expected in practice. However, this substantive doctrinal convergence between national and global legal systems does not eliminate all risks of conflict between the nation-state and global investors; conflicts can occur whenever two actors interpret the same text differently. Once an investment dispute happens, independent investor-state arbitration reviews governmental action according to independent interpretative rules. Systems theory suggests that nation-states can turn such global challenges into opportunities by taking contextual control over global investment in relying on the global investment legal system of the global investment regime. The nation-state can convince global investors that the nation-state respects transnational investment mechanisms, whilst indirectly imbuing norm-making with minimum national interest without incurring serious damage to its reputation. To be specific, the nation-state can attract more foreign investors by accepting the indirect expropriation doctrine and the investor-state arbitration respected by global investors. Simultaneously, the nation-state can secure minimum control over global investment under legitimate regulatory power reflected in the same indirect expropriation clause. In addition, the nation-state can guide the investment tribunal to secure a balance between investment protection and the regulatory power of the host state by prescribing the proportionality principle. Contextual control can be a sub-optimal choice for the nation-state in the sense that it avoids a worst-case scenario by securing proportionality and predictability. In order to make this measure more effective, the current global investment legal system needs to secure more commensurate autonomy or autopoiesis by furthering simultaneous and balanced structural coupling with a greater variety of social powers. In this context, global constitutionalism provides national constitutional tools for the nation-state; specifically, democratic participation in national treaty-making procedures and autopoietic structuralisation of the investment arbitration mechanism can make the substantive contents and application of global investment law fairer and more acceptable, not only to global investors and strong states, but also to social movements and smaller countries. In the context of the KORUS-FTA, the Korean government needs to make the treaty terms of indirect expropriation clearer through democratic participation. At the same time, the Korea should pay attention to making arbitration process reflexive to more various social interests, whilst protecting its operation from inappropriate influences. Such measures can prevent KORUSFTA tribunals from making extremely unacceptable decisions to actors of the global investment regime, including the Korean government, although they could not guarantee ideal decisions that stratify all actors perfectly.",1512391617,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, YounsikKimYounsikKim, Younsik",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264647111 , 80730222 , 101309 , U605692 , U605692 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/7575", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512391617?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/7575 , (UMI)AAIU605692 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Challenges+and+opportunities+for+the+national+constitutional+system+in+dealing+with+the+global+investment+regime%3A+a+case+study+of+the+indirect+expropriation+doctrine+and+investor-state+arbitration+under+the+free+trade+agreement+between+the+republic+of+korea+and+the+united+states+of+america&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Younsik&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"573,Third World Approaches to International Law and the rethinking of international legal education in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century,"In the traditions of both Third World Approaches to International Law and subaltern cosmopolitan legality, the following dissertation sets out a series of critiques of the contemporary international legal regime and proposes a variety of possible responses from Third World nations, subaltern movements and legal academics. This multi-pronged approach is intended to buttress the pluralistic nature of both legal and social reform. In considering how to advance the causes of social justice on an international scale, a strong question, international law may represent a strong answer. For this to happen, some of its etiological inadequacies — including both Eurocentrism and elitism — must be addressed. Of course, Third World scholars have been challenging these deficiencies for decades and it would be altogether presumptuous of me to, assume that I possess the answer. Instead, what I propose are a series of adjustments to a law student's possible engagement of international law. Despite its flaws, even contradictions, international law is consistently represented as the manifestation of universal norms. A consequence of this pretence, I contend, is the blunting of the democratic and creative imaginaries of young law students. Incorporating the topics examined in the following chapters into an international legal curriculum might contribute to a rethink and possible reform of the international legal regime along pluralistic lines.",1520125352,,Dissertations & Theses," Al Attar, MohsenAl AttarMohsenAl Attar, Mohsen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3290412291 , 72390312 , 66569 , 9780499005007 , NS00500 , NS00500", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780499005007, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520125352?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0630 Public policy"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0630 Public policy"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0630 Public policy",," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0630 Public policy"," Law , International law , Public policy"," Social sciences , Elitism , Eurocentrism , Social justice , Third World nations , Universal norms",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Third+World+Approaches+to+International+Law+and+the+rethinking%0Aof+international+legal+education+in+the+21st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al+Attar%2C+Mohsen&amp;isbn=9780499005007&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"574,"From ""Death of the female"" to ""Life itself"": a socio-historic examination of FINRRAGE","Although questions about the production of knowledge are finally beginning to be asked within social movements studies, these tend to rely on a very vague definition of 'knowledge', obscuring activists' engagement with informal and formal research, as well as social forms of knowledge. This thesis employs an analytic framework in which social movements are theorised as producing a distinctive cognitive praxis, in order to examine the ways in which movements emerge, develop, and operationalise their knowledge in pursuit of their goals. In order to do this, I will create a contextualised case study of the Feminist International Network of Resistance to Reproductive and Genetic Engineering (FINRRAGE), examining the ways it sought to develop a knowledge project around new reproductive technologies and present itself as a network of credible knowers. Beginning as a reaction to a 1984 conference panel on new reproductive technology entitled 'Death of the Female', in its strongest phase (1984-1997) FINRRAGE comprised over a thousand women in thirty-seven countries. Although identified as an instance of radical opposition, its strategy relied upon knowledge generation, rather than protest. Employing a textual analysis of archival documents, published writings and lifecourse interviews with an international selection of twenty-four women, the thesis explores the processes by which the network pursued a project of creating an evidence-based position of resistance to the development of reproductive and genetic technologies through empirical research, publication, and continuous negotiation between women from very different social contexts. As such, the study also provides an opportunity to (re)consider feminist engagement with a specific area of technology over an historical period. It is hoped that the result will be a contribution to the academic literature on the development of collective knowledge and expertise for both social movements theory and science and technology studies, as well as to feminist history and theory.",1534998801,,Dissertations & Theses," De Saille, Stevienna MarieDe SailleMarieSteviennaDe Saille, Stevienna Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331732711 , 88330382 , 101309 , U609584 , U609584 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3403/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1534998801?accountid=14496, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research,, 0344 Social research, Social research," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3403/ , (UMI)AAIU609584 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+%22Death+of+the+female%22+to+%22Life+itself%22%3A+a+socio-historic+examination+of+FINRRAGE&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=De+Saille%2C+Stevienna+Marie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"575,"Videogame culture as transnational media: One neoliberalism, many resistances","This dissertation analyzes two best-selling videogames, Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 4 (2008) and Square Enix' Final Fantasy 12 (2006), as sites of contestation between commercial media corporations on the one hand, and communities of artists, consumers and non-commercial digital users on the other. I argue that Metal Gear Solid 4 rewrites the stealth espionage thriller into a critique of neoliberalism's financial speculations and neocolonial wars, while Final Fantasy 12 rewrites the fantasy role-playing videogame into a critique of the colonial and neocolonial legacies of fantasy and role-playing fiction. Using the tools of critical communications theory, postcolonial media studies, and digital media scholarship, I argue that these videogames narrate the struggle between neoliberalism (i.e. the ideology of late 20 th century market fundamentalism which exerted global hegemony during the thirty years from 1975 to 2005) and a wide range of anti-neoliberal social movements, developmental states (especially those of the BRIC nations, i.e. Brazil, Russia, India and China), and non-commercial networks of digital production, distribution and consumption. I also argue that these videogames frame the politics of transnational media production and transnational audience reception in productive ways. At their best, they offer new ways to critique digital capitalism as well as its shadowy obverse, financialized neocolonialism. I conclude that videogames have become an important space for anti-neoliberal cultural critique and political mobilization, and that videogame narratives offer unique insights into transnational identity-politics, the institutions of the digital commons, and the geopolitics of the emerging multipolar world.",1563209093,,Dissertations & Theses," Redmond, Dennis R.RedmondR.DennisRedmond, Dennis R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3436711561 , 80781352 , 66569 , 9781321134124 , 3633562 , 3633562", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321134124, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1563209093?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications",," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," Communication , Web Studies , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , BRIC nations , Brazil , China , Digital commons , Final Fantasy 12 , Hideo Kojima , India , Metal gear solid 4 , RPG , Role playing , Russia , Stealth espionage , Transnational media , Video games",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Videogame+culture+as+transnational+media%3A+One+neoliberalism%2C+many+resistances&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Redmond%2C+Dennis+R.&amp;isbn=9781321134124&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"576,"The Legalization of National Security: State, Society, and the Law on the Use of Force","Many states around the world have increasingly turned to the law in addressing and formulating their national security policies. Whether it is the assassination of Osama bin Laden or American action in Libya, much discussion and debate have focused on the legality of such uses of force. Which side is right in such debates is less important than the legal character such discussions have assumed. This is a significant development, especially given the common assumption that because the law constrains, political leaders eschew the law in strategic contexts. So why are states increasingly turning to law in addressing and formulating their national security policies? From an interdisciplinary perspective, this project argues that the interplay of two main factors has promoted the legalization of national security: the concentration of executive authority and the strength of social movement organizations. First, the growing centralization of executive power, as witnessed through the burgeoning national security bureaucracies and administrative state, has prompted a turn to the law since it is seen as both a valuable instrument in policy promotion in a world of complex threats, as well as an important source of legitimacy. Second, social movement organizations have sought influence in national security through sophisticated litigation strategies that challenge the executive to justify policies through legal argumentation. Therefore, paradoxically, both the expansion of executive authority and pressures against it from below contribute to legalization. These factors represent what this study posits as the growing structural contradiction between the values of statism (sovereignty) and individualism (human rights) in the international system. This fundamental logic of contradiction operates as an important engine for legal and political change and can manifest in different ways, such as competition, conflict, confusion, and contravention. Both the executive and social movements turn to the law because the inherent indeterminacy of law provides both with resources for justification, and such law-based argumentation has reinforced itself and promoted legalization. This project examines variations in both factors through cases studies involving the U.S., China, Japan, and South Korea. The implications of the legalization of national security are significant. First, the approach taken in this study opens up the field to examine not only international law, which has predominated questions on the use of force, but also to seriously examine domestic legal developments. By encompassing domestic law, it offers a more holistic and empirically relevant perspective on a research program that has been overly normative in scope and tone. Second, the focus on domestic law challenges the traditional emphasis on compliance in international legal scholarship. Rather than normatively dismissing non-compliance as simply bad, it is necessary to model and empirically test how violations of certain international rules can promote greater legalization. Executives have used domestic legal arguments and interpretations to try and skirt international obligations, but such non-compliance can have the counter-intuitive result of actually promoting greater legalization and limiting executive use of force.",1614948853,,Dissertations & Theses," Hong, Joon SeokHongSeokJoonHong, Joon Seok",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3467812911 , 76831252 , 66569 , 9781321259315 , 3640469 , 3640469", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321259315, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614948853?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0601 International Relations"," 0398 Law , 0601 International Relations"," 0398 Law , 0601 International Relations",," 0398 Law , 0601 International Relations"," Law , International Relations"," Social sciences , Executive power , International law , Legalization , National security , Social movements , Use of force",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Legalization+of+National+Security%3A+State%2C+Society%2C+and+the+Law+on+the+Use+of+Force&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hong%2C+Joon+Seok&amp;isbn=9781321259315&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"577,"Race Across Borders: Transnationalism and Racial Identity in African-American Fiction, 1929-1945","Race Across Borders: Transnationalism and Racial Identity in African-American Fiction, 1929-1945, examines four African-American literary texts that employ transnational themes and aesthetics as a means of resisting a logic of racial essentialism that governed the production and reception of black literature in the United States during the early 20 th century. I examine the ways in which Dark Princess by W. E. B. Du Bois, Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston, Banjo: A Story Without a Plot by Claude McKay, and If He Hollers Let Him Go by Chester Himes employ various formal and stylistic techniques to critique and reconfigure the dominant codes of racial identity that shaped their context. I argue that each of these texts exemplifies a conflict between a nationalist mode of racial representation and a transnational orientation that destabilizes received notions of race. Whereas the cultural field in which interwar African-American novels were situated involved a manifest nationalist topography which reproduced a racially divided polity, these texts inscribe transnational forces that disrupt the racial underpinnings of the 20th-century American national narrative. Because of the hegemonic status of the nationalist framework, the critique of that framework tends to appear in the formal aspects of the novels rather than their explicit contents. The first chapter considers how Dark Princess explores the intersections between African-American and anti-colonial politics by way of the story of a romantic relationship between an African American man involved in local politics and an Indian woman involved in an international Third World liberation movement. I consider how the juxtaposition of national and transnational forms of solidarity within the text is paralleled by a tension between naturalism and romance in its formal economy. While the techniques of naturalism tend to characterize the parts of the novel that represent national and racial politics, the parts that imagine a transnational anti-colonial movement draw on the codes of literary romance. Through this utopian gesture, the novel gives shape to the conflict between national and transnational perspectives on minority politics without offering a clear resolution to that conflict. The second chapter challenges dominant critical interpretations of Their Eyes Were Watching God, which construe the novel as a written representation of African American oral tradition. While such readings are illuminating, they overlook significant aspects of the text's racial thematic by emphasizing how it presupposes racial forms of identity. Although the novel does reproduce such forms, I argue that it simultaneously resists them, particularly in some of its more marginal characters and moments, and that it is precisely through the representation of dialect speech that these hidden resistances become visible. The third chapter examines McKay's use of the aesthetic concept of the sublime in articulating the problematic gulf separating modern Blacks from metropolitan culture and society. In Banjo the sublime mediates between these terms rather than the rationally free subject and a causally determined Nature. Banjo differs from the mainstream European realist novel by denying the teleological narrative of reconciliation as unsuitable to the concerns of a radically excluded black collective. By taking as his protagonists an international band of black vagabonds based in the cosmopolitan French port city Marseilles, McKay imagines an alternative to the grand narrative of national identity. The final chapter focuses on notions of embodiment and psychological affect within Himes's narrative of thwarted integration. Simultaneously foreclosing on both a successful outcome for such a project and the death of the protagonist, the novel moves towards an ambivalent and open-ended reflection on the possibilities of social transformation. In light of this ambivalence, I view the brief but frequent points at which the protagonist identifies with marginalized Mexican-Americans and Japanese-American internment-camp prisoners as moments that both disrupt the received black/white binary as a schema for American social reality and contrasts a trans-national anti-colonial solidarity with racial nationalism as an alternative mode of political agency.",1666447024,,Dissertations & Theses," Agbodike, Kanayo JasonAgbodikeJasonKanayoAgbodike, Kanayo Jason",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3635054351 , 72209842 , 66569 , 9781321629149 , 3686166 , 3686166", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321629149, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1666447024?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0296 African American Studies"," Comparative literature , African American Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Anti-colonialism , Du Bois, W.

Regulating Banana Production through Voluntary Certification and Labeling,"This study examines the role of Fairtrade certification and labeling in mediating the socio-ecological relations of banana production. Bringing to bear ideas from literature on agro-industrial development and restructuring, agrifood governance, agrarian change, agricultural labor relations, and sustainability, it examines how banana farmers, workers, and their communities are affected by participation in Fairtrade commodity networks under conditions of market liberalization. It concludes that, while, under certain conditions, Fairtrade can benefit some farmers and workers, it fails to address the broader social and ecological conditions of banana production. It attributes the challenges facing the Fairtrade system to the internal dynamics of its consumer-driven, market-based, and developmental model. Specifically, I argue that Fair Trade actors' focus on the terms of exchange fails to address the imperatives of growth and accumulation inherent in capitalist commodity production, which shape outcomes for banana farmers, workers, and environments. The analysis is based on research conducted at two key sites in the banana sector: Ecuador's South Coast and the Urabá region of Colombia. These regions have played an importation role in the expansion of Fairtrade banana supply, albeit under different conditions. In Ecuador, Fairtrade protection has primarily been extended to small farmers under the Fair Trade Labelling Organizations (FLO) Small Producer Organization standards. Meanwhile, the majority of Urabá's producers are certified under FLO's Hired Labor standards. Drawing on in-depth interviews with farmers, workers, administrative and technical staff of Fairtrade-institutions, as well as labor representatives, I find that Fairtrade certification generates uneven outcomes for different groups participating in the system. Activists and researchers have critiqued the expansion of certification to plantations and to the enrollment of transnational agribusiness companies, which they argue has undermined the position of small farmers within the Fairtrade system. Yet these critiques overlook significant socio-ecological complexity and differentiation in Fairtrade banana production. They also obscure the critical role of hired workers on small and large farms alike. The study, thus, attempts to reframe the mainstreaming debate, to place workers at the center of the Fairtrade banana story. In so doing, it argues that international Fair Trade actors must engage more fully with banana unions and labor solidarity movements in order to achieve their purported goals of supporting social and environmental justice in the global banana economy.",1667040174,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, Sandra LynnBrownLynnSandraBrown, Sandra Lynn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3637402221 , 72426952 , 66569 , 9781321629552 , 3686207 , 3686207", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321629552, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667040174?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Agrifood governance , Bananas , Fair trade , Labor",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fairness+for+Whom%3F+Regulating+Banana+Production+through+Voluntary+Certification+and%0ALabeling&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Sandra+Lynn&amp;isbn=9781321629552&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"579,Truth in Transition: The Politics of Mobilization in the Wake of State-Sponsored Violence,"This dissertation examines transitional justice as an emerging transnational movement and asks how actors engaged in transnational legal mobilization in the wake of state-sponsored violence understand their goals and strategies. Drawing from neo-institutional theories of how organizations mediate the meaning of law, and using a variety of research methods, including ethnographic fieldwork in nine countries and in four languages, a web-based survey of 137 transnational actors, qualitative interviews with 187 transnational and local actors, and content analysis of organization documents, the study focuses on the processes through which actors develop strategies to ensure accountability, improve survivor well-being and prevent future violence. The analysis suggests that transitional justice remains an ill-defined construct that makes it popular to actors with contradictory and competing beliefs about law and social change. However, it also creates challenges as actors struggle to define what their goals are and how to achieve them. After articulating the development of transitional justice at the transnational level, the study examines efforts to promote truth commissions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, and the United States. In order to explain why truth commissions appeal to scholars, policy makers, and advocates interested in redressing state-sponsored violence, I develop the theoretical concept of the quasi-judicial medium, a legal body that channels a variety of understandings about law and social change, but may ultimately prioritize procedural over substantive justice. The analysis is used to articulate a new theory of localization, defined as the process through which transnational and local actors accommodate complementary, contradictory, or competing beliefs and practices about what justice means and how to ensure it. The cases reveal three distinct localization processes: disruptive localization in Bosnia and Herzegovina, transformative localization in Colombia, and decoupled localization the United States. Drawing from these case studies, the conclusions address how organizations mediate the meaning of justice as they develop practical strategies to ensure it.",1667091619,,Dissertations & Theses," Rowen, Jamie RebeccaRowenRebeccaJamieRowen, Jamie Rebecca",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3637577131 , 72181982 , 66569 , 9781321631883 , 3686438 , 3686438", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321631883, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667091619?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure",," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," Law , International law , Social structure"," Social sciences , Comparative politics , Human rights , Latin american studies , Slavic studies , Social movements , Transitional justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Truth+in+Transition%3A+The+Politics+of+Mobilization+in+the+Wake+of+State-Sponsored+Violence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rowen%2C+Jamie+Rebecca&amp;isbn=9781321631883&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"580,Where responsibility lies: corporate social responsibility and campaigns for the rights of workers in a global economy,"Sociological analysis of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is, as yet, limited. This thesis analyses how approaches to CSR are defined and mobilised in relation to the rights of workers in transnational contexts of production and exchange. Participation in emerging global discourses of CSR is becoming standard practice amongst transnational corporations, and the growth and professionalisation of CSR, even during global economic crisis, suggests there may be substantial incentives for those seeking to influence agendas. To misunderstand the significance of CSR is dangerous. It is necessary to go beyond questions of whether CSR is merely marketing, to understand how the terms of debate are being set regarding responsibility in the global economy. Drawing on critiques of globalising corporate practices and labour movements research, I examine how these debates are being mobilised not only by politicians and employers, but also by workers and their advocates. Employment relations is an important arena for practical and ideological struggles over CSR, as production networks and labour markets have been dramatically restructured by globalising processes. To investigate the role of contestation in CSR development, labour rights campaigns were investigated as moments when responsibilities to workers are in dispute. A preliminary textual analysis categorised competing CSR agendas in terms of corporate, professional, political and activist approaches. Research into three case studies then explored how these can be mobilised in practice: the factory-focused Keep Burberry British campaign to prevent work being outsourced overseas; the eventfocused PlayFair 2012 campaign for workers making Olympic merchandise; and product-focused campaigns for cut flower workers. The thesis contributes empirically and analytically to understanding the potential implications of emerging approaches to CSR for employment regulation, the relationship of states to corporations, and the response of labour movements. It is argued that activist framing of the employment relationship in terms of CSR is being used to pursue improved conditions of work and to influence debate over where responsibility lies.",1689622592,,Dissertations & Theses," Timms, JillTimmsJillTimms, Jill",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3718850851 , 96792172 , 101309 , U640703 , U640703 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3070/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689622592?accountid=14496," 0454 Management , 0629 Labor relations"," 0454 Management , 0629 Labor relations"," 0454 Management , 0629 Labor relations", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0454 Management , 0629 Labor relations"," Management , Labor relations"," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3070/ , (UMI)AAIU640703 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Where+responsibility+lies%3A+corporate+social+responsibility+and+campaigns+for+the+rights+of+workers+in+a+global+economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Timms%2C+Jill&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"581,"Within borders, beyond borders: the bergama movement at the junction of local, national and transnational practices","This thesis sets out to examine how local environmental movements mobilize to engage a new intertwined national and global context in which capitalist globalization has intensified major problems, in particular social and economic inequalities and ecological degradation. In their struggles, local movements mobilize beyond their local and/or national borders, inserting themselves into transnational networks. A representative of such struggles, as I argue in the thesis, is the Bergama movement. The Bergama Movement, a local environmental movement struggling against a transnational gold-mining company in Western Turkey, is analyzed based on an extensive field research reflecting the geographical scope of and the diversity of actors involved in the movement. The research aims to understand the interrelated dimensions of a social movement such as initial mobilization, mobilizing structures, framing, identity construction, and political opportunities; embedding it in a new political and social context in which structures and practices at varying levels of politics become enmeshed. Thus, the thesis shows that making clear-cut distinctions between the local, the national and the global, is inadequate in understanding local movements which challenge actors of capitalist globalization. The contribution of this thesis lies in using the case of the Bergama movement to unpack the interrelated dynamics involved in enmeshed scales of doing politics. In that regard, I show that national and transnational actors align themselves, as in the case of the state in Turkey and transnational mining corporations, in a pro-mine network, while the Bergama activists have formed an extensive movement network by forging links with global civil society actors, external political parties, supranational and international organizations and the media who challenge capitalist globalization. Witnessing that their national political context is being restructured under capitalist globalization, they extensively utilize transnational political opportunities and define themselves as part of a general anti-capitalist globalization struggle.",1689623322,,Dissertations & Theses," Uncu, Baran AlpUncuAlpBaranUncu, Baran Alp",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3718851241 , 96792762 , 101309 , U640708 , U640708 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/498/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689623322?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0601 International Relations, International Relations," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/498/ , (UMI)AAIU640708 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Within+borders%2C+beyond+borders%3A+the+bergama+movement+at+the+junction+of+local%2C+national+and+transnational+practices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Uncu%2C+Baran+Alp&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"582,"""We have families to feed"": Exploring the push and pull factors for South African medical doctors migrating to other countries","The globalisation of labour markets is at hand. After re-joining global markets post-apartheid, South Africa was faced with different forms of labour market flexibility. This flexibility allowed workers to seek working opportunities wherever they could be found. Also, it further allowed countries to explore international borders, recruiting people of the desired skills in their respective countries. Consequently, South Africa has seen lots of movements within and to outside of the country. These movements are by skilled professionals, semi-skilled and the unskilled. Over the past two decades, there has been rapid growth in migration by health workers. In particular, these have been mostly nurses and doctors. When these professionals migrate, it is usually based on their social, geographical, political, economic needs or otherwise. This study therefore, explores the pull and push factors that influence South African medical doctors in migrating to other countries. This study was done in three cities in South African namely, Durban, Johannesburg and Pretoria. In explaining data obtained from the doctors interviewed three theorists were used, Bourdieu on forms of capital, Marx on class and Weber on status. The results indicate there are various factors that influence migration by South African medical doctors. They further indicate that, because doctors are of different life trajectories, their influences for migrating may differ. Ultimately, this study explored but did not conclude that, doctors are professionals that migrate concerned with the primary goal of restoring an element of status. This element I assert has been eroded by the changing nature of work. Therefore, I have argued that, prestige, social honour and economic means make up a medical doctor status in society and that migration is a move towards sustaining this status.",1704856922,,Dissertations & Theses," Nomvete, Sandla Sakhe SikhoNomveteSakhe SikhoSandlaNomvete, Sandla Sakhe Sikho",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3780873611 , 98422972 , 66569 , 9781321956245 , 1595886 , 1595886", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321956245, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1704856922?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0654 South African Studies"," 0629 Labor relations , 0654 South African Studies"," 0629 Labor relations , 0654 South African Studies",," 0629 Labor relations , 0654 South African Studies"," Labor relations , South African Studies"," Social sciences , Globalisation , Immigration , South africa , South african doctors",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22We+have+families+to+feed%22%3A+Exploring+the+push+and+pull+factors+for+South+African+medical+doctors+migrating+to+other+countries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nomvete%2C+Sandla+Sakhe+Sikho&amp;isbn=9781321956245&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"583,Transnational advocacy networks: the case of roma mobilization in macedonia and serbia,"The purpose of this study is to ascertain and explain the effectiveness of Roma political activism in contesting state oppression in Macedonia and Serbia. More specifically, this thesis seeks to investigate the divergent treatment of Roma communities in the respective states by analyzing the role of state institutions, civil society, political parties and international organizations. The thesis seeks to provide a multi-level analysis of Roma mobilization in Macedonia and Serbia by addressing the domestic and international factors that influence Roma political activism, and relies on two main theoretical concepts within the social movement literature: the Political Opportunity Structure (POS) model and 'transnational advocacy networks.' The POS model is a comprehensive framework to assess if Roma political activism has been effective in Macedonia and Serbia. This study uses the following components to describe the domestic factors that may facilitate or constrain Romani activism in the respective states: state repression and/or facilitation, institutional access, influential domestic and international allies. This thesis attempts to provide a detailed analysis of movement dynamics by taking into account the inter-relationship between actors and contesting groups. The limitations of the domestic opportunity structure regarding Roma advocacy in Macedonia and Serbia are outlined by describing the political context concerning minority inclusion, institutional mechanisms, and NGO/political party activities. As domestic opportunity structures are 'closed,' Roma activists and NGOs seek international allies to influence and change domestic policy on Roma inclusion. This study, while recognizing the importance of other international initiatives, specifically focuses on various institutions of the European Union as the main international actor influencing Roma inclusion policies in Eastern Europe. The thesis outlines the main EU initiatives on Roma inclusion to provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges in the international arena. Furthermore, it analyzes the interaction between international and civil society organizations assessing the effectiveness of the 'transnational advocacy networks.'

This thesis is a case study of one such body, the Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry (HFAM). The roots of women's Freemasonry reach back to the eighteenth-century French Lodges of Adoption. In 1902, the social reformer and Theosophist Annie Besant established a lodge of the French-based International Order of Co-Freemasonry, Le Droit Humain, in London. In 1908, the clergyman William Cobb led a secession from Besant's Order and created the HFAM, which under the charismatic leadership of Cobb and his successor Marion Halsey, became the largest British Masonic Order admitting women. An analysis of HFAM's social composition shows the dominance of aristocratic women during the period before 1914 and illustrates the functioning of social networks in support of the women's movement. HFAM mobilised these networks to support the campaign for women's suffrage. An innovative social experiment by the HFAM was the establishment in 1916 of the Halsey Training College to train secondary school teachers. With the expansion of the social basis of HFAM's membership after the First World War, HFAM's organisation of its philanthropic activities changed with the establishment of its Bureau of Service. This smaller-scale but more diverse social programme undertook effective work at a local level but ultimately proved unsustainable. The HFAM illustrates many structural issues of the women's movement: the importance of quasi-religions such as Theosophy; the leadership of aristocratic women; the importance of male support; and the effect of a shift to more local activities and a wider middle class membership after the First World War. In particular, the HFAM provides new perspectives on interpretations of the idea of the complementarity of the sexes within the women's movement to 1935.",1887053486,,Dissertations & Theses," Pilcher-Dayton, Ann JessicaPilcher-DaytonJessicaAnnPilcher-Dayton, Ann Jessica",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321668767 , 80730012 , 101309 , U606511 , U606511 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/15012/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1887053486?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," European history , Womens studies"," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/15012/ , 575742 , Social sciences , United Kingdom",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+freemasons+and+feminist+causes+1908-1935%3A+the+case+of+the+honourable+fraternity+of+antient+masonry&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pilcher-Dayton%2C+Ann+Jessica&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"585,"Citizenship in times of exception: The turn to security and the politics of human rights in Valle del Cauca, Colombia","Since at least the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, security has emerged as a major political paradigm built upon an expansive definition of state control emphasizing not only the mere policing of violations of law, but the means through which the state asserts itself as a particular political entity through the militarized management of social actors both inside and outside its borders. Through an analysis of the case of Colombia's Democratic Security policy, this dissertation documents the transformations of social mobilization within the boundaries of the newly politicized, and newly globalized, security state. The research builds upon six months of ethnographic work and in-depth interviews with Valle del Cauca regional chapters of pacifist feminist grassroots network Women’s Peaceful Route, with human rights advocacy organization Permanent Committee for Human Rights, and with afrodescendant movement Process of Black Communities. Analyzing the work of these organizations, this dissertation assesses the uneven impact of security policies on social actors claiming territorial, cultural, and political rights. Through these organizations the work illuminates how security is gendered and racialized, while it is strongly resisted by the movements’ challenge to the model of citizenship promoted by the state. The research poses that, no longer able to see human rights work in terms of the defense of individuals, social movements have instead redeployed the concept of human rights as a mode of articulating radical democratic demands reflecting a collective social struggle. Illustrating the connections between neoliberal development and security, and its impact for afrodescendants and women’s claims for rights and recognition, the dissertation shows how global discourses on security influence the constitution of new social identities through the constant re-iteration of the question 'who is the terrorist,' and the subsequent re-articulation of new parameters of citizenship.

In the nineteenth century, a populist Christianity took shape on the expanding American rural frontier. It embraced the religious experiences and energy of ordinary people, was used to challenge the authority of elites, and created powerful new religious leaders. Through revivalism it mobilized its adherents to adopt new forms of organization. Entrepreneurial self-sufficiency, exemplified in the frontier idiom ""root hog or die,"" was valued. In the late nineteenth century, increased global travel and British imperial expansion created new settings similar to those on the American frontier. Taylor's introduction of American frontier Christianity to six continents is reconstructed through historical analysis of newspapers, books, correspondence, and memoirs. He was among the first Protestant missionaries in California and preceded the Reconstruction-era flood of Americans into Palestine. Taylor was the first of a wave of international evangelists to tour Australasia. His introduction of American revivalism played a catalytic role in the South African Revival of 1866. In India, Taylor organized churches among a marginalized population that other Christian missionaries had disregarded. In postwar America, he led a grass-roots missionary movement to challenge his church's leadership. Taylor began missions in South America at a time when liberal political regimes opened the social space necessary for new Protestant missions. He took advantage of European exploration to pioneer new missions in Central Africa. Analysis of Taylor's career reveals a complex interplay between religious belief and social context. Taylor fused his frontier Christianity, a theology informed by the nineteenth century American holiness movement, and his global encounters with different cultures, languages, and religions into a novel and influential theory for Christian mission. In multiple settings, people who already identified themselves as Christians, but for whom that identity had weakened due to migration, social disruption, or marginalization, were most receptive to Taylor's populist, entrepreneurial, and voluntarist style of frontier Christianity.",1080960672,,Dissertations & Theses," Tzan, Douglas D.TzanD.DouglasTzan, Douglas D.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2773543021 , 72211872 , 66569 , 9781267638151 , 3529033 , 3529033", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267638151, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1080960672?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history",," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," Biographies , Religious history , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American Christianity , Christian missions , Entrepreneurial self-sufficiency , Frontier , Methodism , Taylor, William",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Root+hog+or+die%22%3A+William+Taylor%2C+entrepreneurial+self-sufficiency%2C+and+the+global+spread+of+American+frontier+Christianity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tzan%2C+Douglas+D.&amp;isbn=9781267638151&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"587,"Beyond liberation: Students, space, and the state in East Pakistan/Bangladesh 1952-1990","This dissertation examines the history of East Pakistan/Bangladesh's student movements in the postcolonial period. The principal argument is that the major student mobilizations of Dhaka University are evidence of an active student engagement with shared symbols and rituals across time and that the campus space itself has served as the linchpin of this movement culture. The category of ""student"" developed into a distinct political class that was deeply tied to a concept of local place in the campus; however, the idea of ""student"" as a collective identity also provided a means of ideological engagement with a globally imagined community of ""students."" Thus, this manuscript examines the case study of student mobilizations at Dhaka University in various geographic scales, demonstrating the levels of local, national and global as complementary and interdependent components of social movement culture.

The NWP was an internal program at the AFSC, initiated by women staff and committee members who challenged the practices of gender discrimination within the organization and initiated external AFSC programs that served women's unique needs in peace and social justice initiatives. By focusing primarily on the serial inserts of the group's newsletter from 1978 to 1988, entitled Women and Global Corporations: Work, Roles, Resistance, this project draws attention to the dense networks of transnational communication and resistance against global economic restructuring during this time. It uses and challenges social movement scholarship by suggesting that the analytical frameworks of transnational advocacy networks and social movement mobilization more accurately capture the antiglobalization activity that took place several decades prior to when it is conventionally identified in 1999. The project highlights the NWP's social movement brokerage and the embodied social movement activities of the activists, scholars, and laborers in its orbit. These social movement activities included boycotts, letter-writing campaigns, labor organizing, and a plethora of other on-the-ground activities and discursive practices against global corporations and the institutions that supported them. An investigation into the sources of the NWP's knowledge production in brokering this movement reveals both Quaker and feminist influences that call into question the conventionally accepted binary between religion and secularity in the Western imaginary. The presence of Quaker and feminist influences on the NWP's understandings of globalization provides the opportunity for thinking through at least two possibilities: how a tacit Protestant secularism within the organization contributed to its own erasure, and how contemporary globalization narratives are infused with a Protestant secularism that insidiously frames globalization resistance as retrograde and fuels a universalizing (and therefore exclusionary) notion of progress and unsustainable growth.",1294058530,,Dissertations & Theses," Way, Patricia A.WayA.PatriciaWay, Patricia A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2898457041 , 75622562 , 66569 , 9781267908285 , 3552368 , 3552368", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267908285, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1294058530?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0510 Economics"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0510 Economics"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0510 Economics",," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0510 Economics"," Religion , Womens studies , Economics"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Feminist , Globalization , Quaker , Religion , Secular , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Troubling+secular+assumptions%3A+What+%22early%22+feminist+resistance+can+tell+us+about+globalization%2C+religion%2C+and+secularism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Way%2C+Patricia+A.&amp;isbn=9781267908285&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"589,"Diaspora Movements, Social Networks, and Civil Wars: The Irish-American (Dis)connection and the Northern Ireland Troubles","Armed insurgents often seek material and other forms of support from communities beyond the borders of contested states. Situating long-distance, grassroots financing of rebel groups as a form of social movement, this dissertation examines patterns of transnational radicalism among diasporic populations with regard to ""homeland"" civil wars. The study is conducted within a dynamic, multilevel framework that analyzes: (1) the nested political opportunity context (i.e., domestic, international, and transnational) within which militants must mobilize for ""the cause""; (2) the availability of potential resources, especially socio-organizational ones; and (3) the strategic capacity (skill and social capital endowments) of movement leaders. It devotes significant attention to social network properties and mechanisms that facilitate collective action. More specifically, the dissertation investigates patterns of Irish-American support for the Provisional Irish Republican Army's campaign in the 1970s and 1980s. It asks why financing for the republican movement was very modest (although significant) given the vast size of Irish America, and in comparison to other ""groups"" with respect to their ""homeland"" wars. This dissertation argues that coordinated suppression among a triad of governments with robust state capacity (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland) created legal risks and costs to supporters and limited the movement's reachability beyond tightly-knit communities. At the same time, these Irish ""urban villages"" were dissipating as a result of exclusionary US immigration policy, an economic boom in the Republic of Ireland, and upward social mobility in the United States. Socioeconomic integration coupled with few new immigrants led to the disintegration of moral economies, occupational desegregation, spatial dispersion, and an emaciated organizational infrastructure. Yet how the Irish Northern Aid Committee (Noraid)—the main republican fundraising arm in the United States—endured for the three-decades-long conflict in the face of these countervailing challenges from above and below presents a second puzzle. The study argues that the leadership's network-building strategies explain the organization's resilience. While Noraid actively cultivated interpersonal ties among the Irish in the United States and across the Atlantic, movement leaders pursued three strategies at the organizational level that would prove crucial to Noraid's longevity (centralization, co-optation of existing communal institutions, and brokerage, especially with building trades unions).",1314415320,,Dissertations & Theses," Zach, Danielle A.ZachA.DanielleZach, Danielle A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907025171 , 75913352 , 66569 , 9781267926180 , 3553280 , 3553280", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267926180, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314415320?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," International Relations , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Civil wars , Diaspora , Irish-Americans , Northern Ireland , Social movements , Social networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Diaspora+Movements%2C+Social+Networks%2C+and+Civil+Wars%3A+The+Irish-American+%28Dis%29connection+and+the+Northern+Ireland+Troubles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zach%2C+Danielle+A.&amp;isbn=9781267926180&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"590,"The crossroads of Earth and Heaven: Methodism's Malaysia Mission and the making of the global world, 1885-1915","This dissertation argues that missionary religion played a role in the development of historical globalization, defined as an increase in global flows leading to global interdependence and the sense of the world as one. It asserts that globalization, far from being a contemporary phenomenon, was well underway at the turn of the twentieth century and that religious forces deserve consideration as drivers of this process along with economic, political, and other factors. This dissertation uses a case study of Methodist missions in Malaysia to make this point. It examines the ways in which the Malaysia Mission served as a globalizing force for those involved with it. While the mission benefitted from the globalizing effects of migratory networks, capitalism, colonialism, and communication technologies, it also facilitated global flows of people, resources, power, information, and ideologies. The Malaysia Mission acted as a social network to guide and assist the world-wide movement of mission supporters, missionaries, and church members. It developed capacities similar to a multinational corporation or international non-governmental organization and was thereby able to coordinate personnel and logistics on an international scale, raise money broadly, and support entrepreneurial economic endeavors. In its role as a voluntary organization that educated its members, the Malaysia Mission facilitated processes of individual empowerment among its local leaders, women, and students. Through its function as a global communications network, the mission spread concepts about the land and people of Malaysia to justify its expansion; used news to forge a sense of connection to the communities of the mission, Methodism more broadly, and evangelical Protestantism; and spread Protestant, Methodist, and holiness theological and moral ideals. In its most important and unique contribution to globalization, the Malaysia Mission prompted those associated with it to think of themselves and the world in new ways, as global people in a global space. Globalization, this dissertation concludes, is predicated upon an understanding of the world as a global whole. Missionary religion played a significant role in creating that notion. This insight inspires a reconsideration of scholarly understandings of globalization, missionary religion, and the relationship between the two.",1319512306,,Dissertations & Theses," Scott, David WilliamScottWilliamDavidScott, David William",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2927271381 , 72211872 , 66569 , 9781267959058 , 3536931 , 3536931", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267959058, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1319512306?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History",," 0320 Religious history , 0332 History"," Religious history , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Globalization , Malaysia , Methodist missions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+crossroads+of+Earth+and+Heaven%3A++Methodism%27s+Malaysia+Mission+and+the+making+of+the+global+world%2C+1885-1915&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Scott%2C+David+William&amp;isbn=9781267959058&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"591,"Ethnification and Recredentialing: Alberta's Undelivered Promises to Global Migrants from China, India, and the Philippines (2008-2010)","My study 1) compares the human-and-social capital of three major global immigrants (Chinese, Filipinos, Indians) in Canada (Alberta) with the education policies of their respective home countries; 2) looks at the possible link these policies might have with Alberta’s neoliberal policy of education privatization; and 3) examines how this link shapes or is shaped by broader political, economic, and social policies of international organizations.

Participants’ narratives yield interesting plots complementary to my study assumptions: 1) Canada’s accommodation of these immigrants through decredentialing and recredentialing, ethnification, linguistic prejudice, and racialization of education and labor comprises the major plot in international movements and relations; 2) changes in the nature of Chinese, Indian, and Philippine societies plus these countries’ higher education policies and labor market practices that serve as the push factors in international migration are complicit in a global circuit of oppression; 3) continuing colonialism in the supraterritorial regime of neoliberal globalization impacts on the global migrants: deregulation of market dynamics, development's inability to deliver its promise of a quality of life for most people, fascism of insecurity, global market-determined economy, hyper-marketization of social life, increasing incongruence of the functions of social emancipation and social regulation, liberalization of cross-border transactions, privatization of assets and social services, regulation of peoples and economies, and sovereignty of the market.

By underlining a cultural studies approach, this thesis adopts an interdisciplinary method, bringing together scholarship and materials—in both English and Chinese—from a multitude of academic fields, including film/media studies, gender/queer studies, sociology, anthropology, performance studies, literary criticisms, and so on. By doing so, this project reflects the complicated processes through which Chinese tongzhi /queer imaginaries take shape along the axes of the thesis's four main themes: the Chinese familial system, camp aesthetic, Chinese opera, and documentary film. Locating tonghzi/queer agency within the intricate negotiation between the individual, the local, the regional, and the global, this thesis challenges the conception that perceives the local as the opposite of the global, and that conveniently ignores the more complex, multi-directional interactions involving not only the global but also the regional and the individual in any local articulations of tongzhi /queer agency. In so doing this thesis further contests the rhetoric that either equates Western gay identity with modernity and Asian homosexualities with tradition in its articulation of a ""global gay"" identity, or that conversely sees the local tongzhi /queer movement as merely a neocolonial embodiment of the Western-dominated global gay movement devoid of local agency. Especially evident throughout this dissertation is my strong emphasis on the cultural histories specific to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. I map out the social economies imperative to the production of queer images in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and I also analyze the historical moment of queer imagery emerging from the margins of the Mainland Chinese society. I consider this dissertation as first and foremost a historically embedded project, which admittedly means to counter the insensitivity to local histories underlying certain cross-cultural queer interpretations.",1334958157,,Dissertations & Theses," Chao, Shi-YanChaoShi-YanChao, Shi-Yan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2951020561 , 77540402 , 66569 , 9781267995599 , 3556981 , 3556981", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267995599, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1334958157?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Asian Studies , GLBT Studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Camp aesthetics , Chinese film/media , Diaspora , Documentary film , Globalization , Tongzhi/queer",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Processing+Tongzhi+Imaginaries%3A+Chinese+Queer+Representation+in+the+Global+Mediascape&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chao%2C+Shi-Yan&amp;isbn=9781267995599&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"593,"'Any Name That Has Power': The Black Panthers of Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States, 1948-1977","The US Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was an organization of the Black Power Movement, a cultural and a political nationalist movement central to the history of the African-American Freedom Struggle. The Black Panthers' anti-imperialist politics, militant visual style, grassroots strategies, and community programs appealed within and beyond the United States. Between 1967 and 1972, people of color struggling under class and ethnic oppression in six countries outside the United States formed Black Panther Parties inspired by the US Panthers. In the United Kingdom, West Indians, West Africans, and South Asians formed a Black Panther Movement in 1968 and in Israel, a group of Mizrahi (Arab) Jews founded a Black Panther Party in in Jerusalem in 1971. This dissertation examines these two movements with reference to the US Black Panthers in order to place local, national, and global histories in dialogue. This study adopts a transnational framework that conceives of Black Power as a movement of global migrants. From 1948 to 1967, over two million people from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean migrated to the UK and Israel. These migrants' overlapping experiences of displacement and class- and ethnic-based oppression led them to establish Black Panther groups in their new home countries in order to raise their political concerns under a collective banner. These people chose to become Black Panthers specifically because the US Black Panther Party offered a name and style that connected their global brothers and sisters to a range of grassroots strategies promoting interethnic solidarity and the collective advancement of black communities against the social structures that fostered racism. Through the examination of oral histories, photographs, letters, fliers, passport stamps, films, court cases, and surveillance files, this study focuses on how these global Panther activists represented themselves and their politics in the public sphere. Both the British and Israeli Panther movements first organized in response to the city police's harassment of youth in their neighborhoods. Their respective critiques expanded from an opposition to police brutality to systemic goals of improving housing, education, welfare, and employment for blacks. Both of the nation-states in which these groups emerged relied upon the US for military stability and economic support during this period, such that the British and Israeli Panthers saw confrontations with their respective governments as acts of resistance to American Empire. This dissertation, then, is at once a community study of two branches of a transnational social movement as well as a larger story. The broader narrative reveals how everyday people responded to the American Empire in the 1960s and 1970s, how the US Black Panthers translated black internationalist politics into urban neighborhoods, and how people outside the US constructed narratives about African-Americans as a way of making sense of racial formations at home. This work also demonstrates how foreign governments and media producers appropriated African-American history for a variety of in political purposes during this period. This examination enables a deeper understanding of the transnational black freedom struggle, as it centers the role that people of color outside the United States played in creating and sustaining Black Panther Movements that confronted American and British Empires from the grassroots.",1352773774,,Dissertations & Theses," Angelo, Anne-MarieAngeloAnne-MarieAngelo, Anne-Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2972947321 , 78684252 , 66569 , 9781303037207 , 3558929 , 3558929", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303037207, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1352773774?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0296 African American Studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0296 African American Studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History",," 0296 African American Studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," African American Studies , European history , American history , History"," Social sciences , Arab , Black british , Black panthers , Black power , Israel , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27Any+Name+That+Has+Power%27%3A+The+Black+Panthers+of+Israel%2C+the+United+Kingdom%2C+and+the+United+States%2C+1948-1977&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Angelo%2C+Anne-Marie&amp;isbn=9781303037207&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"594,Bargaining in a Labor Regime: Plantation Life and the Politics of Development in Sri Lanka,"This dissertation is an ethnographic study of migrant labor, development, and gender among Malaiyaha (""Hill Country"") Tamil tea plantation residents in contemporary Sri Lanka. It draws on one year of field research (2008-2009) conducted during state emergency rule in Sri Lanka amongst Malaiyaha Tamil plantation residents, migrant laborers, and community members responding to histories of dislocation and ethnic marginalization. Based on ethnographic observations, detailed life histories, and collaborative dialogue, it explores how Malaiyaha Tamils reconstitute what it means to be a political minority in an insecure Sri Lankan economy and state by 1) employing dignity-enabling strategies of survival through ritual practices and storytelling; 2) abandoning income-generating options on the plantations to ensure financial security; and 3) seeking radical alternatives to traditional development through employment of rights-based ideologies and networks of solidarity in and beyond Sri Lanka. Attending to these three spheres of collective practice—plantation life, migrant labor experience, and human development—this dissertation examines how Malaiyaha Tamils actively challenge historical representations of bonded labor and political voicelessness in order to rewrite their representative canon in Sri Lanka. At the center of each pragmatic site is the Malaiyaha Tamil woman. Focusing particularly on the female worker, I present emerging gender relations and experiences in group life, transnational labor mobilization, and development work that pose radical and deliberate alternatives to economic marginalization and capitalist plantation production in Sri Lanka. Negotiating their place within patriarchal structures on the plantation and in civil society, Malaiyaha Tamil women present themselves in ways that sharply contrast the expert narratives of their experiences, which are composed for public recognition and consumption. Interceding this transmission of knowledge, their stories actively transform plantation development discourses in Sri Lanka and resituate their practices within the more enabling frame of transnational feminism and solidarity. Addressing lacunas in South Asian, social science, and humanities literature on Malaiyaha Tamil women, this dissertation contributes lived content on previously unrecorded women's experiences and complicates former accounts of the woman worker in Sri Lanka. Informing this project is the relationship among community, vulnerability, and reproduction. How are forms of Malaiyaha Tamil development and membership, when increasingly opened up to the realm of the political, made at once vulnerable and generative in their attempts to gain a sense of security and belonging in Sri Lanka? What do practices of cultural reconfiguration and solidarity-building reveal about the persistence of community as an affective term and the woman worker's position in global movements of transnational feminism and migrant labor? Each chapter focuses on this relationship in the context of the final months and aftermath of civil war in Sri Lanka, and I engage the work of political theorists, Sri Lankan historians, and development scholars to argue for a more productive way of thinking about communities in crisis. I argue that community is the continual mental exercise of self-refinement and a mode in which Malaiyaha Tamils address insecurities of a closed past with intentional practices of fixing belief in an open present. This enabling perspective allows us to account for the realities of social investment, movement, and network-building that Malaiyaha Tamils experience in Sri Lanka. By analyzing the contradictions and legacy of seizing Malaiyaha Tamil plantation experience in Sri Lankan history and scholarship, this dissertation seeks to envision the Sri Lankan woman worker as a global subject with transformative possibilities for her community and nation and contribute to the anthropologies of development, labor, and gender in South Asia.",1353398154,,Dissertations & Theses," Jegathesan, MythriJegathesanMythriJegathesan, Mythri",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2975667061 , 77413302 , 66569 , 9781303045608 , 3559471 , 3559471", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303045608, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1353398154?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Labor relations , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Development , Gender , Labor , Migration , Sri Lanka , Tamil studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bargaining+in+a+Labor+Regime%3A+Plantation+Life+and+the+Politics+of+Development+in+Sri+Lanka&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jegathesan%2C+Mythri&amp;isbn=9781303045608&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"595,Re-conceptualizing the enclave in an era of transnationalism: Ethnic solidarity and upward mobility in the Korean enclave in Beijing,"This project uses ethnographic research conducted between 2010 and 2011, as well as original survey data (n=800), to examine how the transnational enclave impacts opportunities for upward mobility among Koreans in Beijing. Specifically, I set out to challenge how the key principles of the enclave hypothesis differed within the transnational context by examining four empirical field sites: 1) the space of everyday life in the enclave (chapter 5), 2) the ethnic church (chapter 6), 3) the individual experiences of first-generation South Koreans and third- and fourth-generation Korean Chinese ethnic entrepreneurs, and 4) the South Korean chaebol (conglomerate) firm in Beijing (chapter 8). My project demonstrates that the mechanisms of ethnic solidarity touted in the enclave hypothesis are largely absent in the Korean transnational enclave in Beijing. Frequent transnational movement and disparities in class and cultural identity have led to bifurcated social networks, residential segregation, and institutional fragmentation within the community. While the enclave still provides minorities with opportunities by facilitating the growth of transnational activities, buffering the costs of immigration, and stimulating the accumulation of foreign capital, migrants face formidable obstacles in mobilizing ethnic resources due to damaged bonds of ethnic solidarity. Rather than rely solely the enclave for sustenance, migrants must move flexibly across a broad range of contexts both inside and outside the enclave to gain access to resources to sustain their entrepreneurial activities. To this end, third- and fourth-generation Korean Chinese migrants who are able to act as cultural intermediaries are best able to utilize the opportunities available in the transnational enclave, whereas their first-generation South Korean counterparts, despite their high levels of human capital, largely fail to due to their inability to form ties with local Chinese bureaucrats. The ability to form social networks with locals plays a critical role in Korean entrepreneurs’ ability to manage the institutionally uncertain environment of the PRC. The enclave, by geographically and socially sequestering the South Koreans within their own community, largely perpetuates their isolation from Chinese society and as a result, their perpetual dependence on Korean Chinese intermediaries to conduct business.",1355759929,,Dissertations & Theses," Yoon, Sharon J.YoonJ.SharonYoon, Sharon J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2981375441 , 79133852 , 66569 , 9781303062629 , 3560351 , 3560351", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303062629, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1355759929?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Asian Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , China , Enclave , Entrepreneurship , Ethnic solidarity , Korean Chinese , Koreans in Beijing , Transnationalism , Upward mobility",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re-conceptualizing+the+enclave+in+an+era+of+transnationalism%3A+Ethnic+solidarity+and+upward+mobility+in+the+Korean+enclave+in+Beijing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yoon%2C+Sharon+J.&amp;isbn=9781303062629&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"596,"Networking sports feminism: Rhetoric, transnational feminisms, and sport policy in a digital era","This dissertation brings an interdisciplinary methodology to bear on the rhetorical analysis of women's sport and health social movements in the twenty-first century. Specifically, I read ""sports feminism"" as a rhetorical discourse that engages ongoing feminist struggles for women's rights to both their bodies and public space. Drawing on transnational feminist rhetorics, I network sports feminist arguments to international policy documents, like the Brighton and Beijing Declarations, to illustrate how the topoi of sport, health, and fitness function as commonplaces in global gender mainstreaming policy. In applying the metaphor of the network to the communicative infrastructure of global sports feminist advocacy, I also draw on new media rhetorics to analyze the role of the wireless Internet and social networking in the rhetorical practice of networking sports feminist policy and arguments across transnational lines of difference. Yet, in reading the rhetorical practices of the Women's International Sports Movement and Nike's Girl Effect through transnational feminist rhetoric, I illustrate how sports feminism is neither a homogenous discourse nor singular feminist identity, and thus, must be analyzed as a pluralistic political praxis with competing rhetorical objectives and audiences. Thus, the final chapter situates sports feminist rhetoric locally in the context of US-based girl power media culture, analyzing the impact of sports feminist rhetoric on the embodied perceptions of gender and gender relations of adolescent American girls. The project thus demonstrates the importance of understanding sports feminist rhetoric's global sociopolitical and economic roles and its impact on gendered identity and labor in the twenty-first century.",1364612099,,Dissertations & Theses," Wright, Cassie A.WrightA.CassieWright, Cassie A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2987167181 , 79123032 , 66569 , 9781303088704 , 3561659 , 3561659", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303088704, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1364612099?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology , 0681 Rhetoric"," Womens studies , Sociology , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Networks , Rhetoric , Social media , Sport policy , Transnational feminism , Women's social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Networking+sports+feminism%3A+Rhetoric%2C+transnational+feminisms%2C+and+sport+policy+in+a+digital+era&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wright%2C+Cassie+A.&amp;isbn=9781303088704&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"597,World War II and the Cold War era: A catalyst for civil rights activism and xenophobia in America,"In the past fifty years, the Civil Rights movement has changed America more than any other social movement. The efforts of civil rights activist such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Stokley Carmichael, and Jessie Jackson profoundly altered America's treatment of its minorities in a way which represents one of its most powerful domestic accomplishments over the past century. Yet one aspect of the Civil Rights Movement has always been neglected in the conventional history of the movement. This aspect was the Civil Rights Movement connection to the Cold War. For America to win the Cold War, civil rights were a necessity. The continuing domestic discrimination against non-white minorities would make it impossible to win over the newly free Third World. This research examined the original intent and purpose of America's foreign diplomacy as it relates to decisions, by key figures such as Harry Truman, that were made regarding the Cold War and America's fight against communism. Furthermore, this research shall point out that America did not just randomly decide to be nicer to people of color in the 1960s, instead of the 1920s or the 1890s. Instead, it ended segregation because not doing so would greatly damage the fight against communism. Civil Rights was therefore not just the right thing to do, but also vitally important to the national interest.

This study asks two main questions: First, given Hmong Americans' particular contexts of exit and contexts of reception, how and to what extent have Hmong former refugees and their U.S.-born children been incorporated into the U.S. political system? Second, how do broader political contexts or homeland circumstances shape Hmong American politics and the state's treatment of Hmong in the U.S. and abroad? I address these questions through two historical analyses of Hmong Americans' non-electoral and electoral participation and two detailed case studies of Hmong Americans' social movements. The first historical analysis focuses on Hmong Americans' protest events from 1980 to 2011. Through news media reports and relevant archival materials, I examine 84 Hmong American protests, their contents, and their consequences on public policies and mobilizers' organizational capacity. My findings show that during the past three decades, Hmong Americans' patterns of protest participation are oriented toward both the host society and the homeland. Homeland-oriented protests, rather than declining in frequency, have occurred at a rate almost equal to domestic-oriented protests. The findings also show that Hmong Americans' engagement in protest activities, regardless of domestic or international orientations, has helped them nurture their civic sense and strengthen their organizational capacity. My second historical analysis focuses on Hmong Americans' electoral participation across three U.S. states--California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin--between 1990 and 2012. I find evidence that Hmong Americans have achieved greater descriptive representation in Minnesota and Wisconsin compared to California. This difference in the level of descriptive representation appears to be due to differences in state and local political contexts. But a significant relative ethnic population size and the presence of ethnic collective mobilization are common to places with higher levels of descriptive representation. The first extended case study examines two interrelated social movements of the early to late-1990s: Hmong Americans' multi-site movements against the benefit ineligibility provisions in the federal Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and their movements in support of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act since 1990. This study reveals that framing plays a crucial role in the success of protest/social movements. The second extended case study builds on the first case study to the extent that it examines in detail the contentious, interactive processes of social problem construction that underlie two other Hmong American movements for greater political inclusion. Drawing on interviews and primary written sources, I examine a Hmong American-led social movement that sought to incorporate Hmong history into the social science curriculum of California's public schools and the emotionally intense ethnic counter-movement that arose to meet it. My findings suggest that the mass media play crucial roles in creating cultural opportunities for the emergence of certain social problems and in (de)legitimizing such social problems.

Facebook as a public sphere space was used as a powerful tool to enhance communicative action among Egyptians, dissidents, and global observers. Drawing on the philosophical and theoretical notions of individuality and the responsibilities of the state of John Locke (1689; 1690), Jean Jacques Rousseau (1762); the public sphere and communicative action of Jürgen Habermas (1981; 1989); and Manuel Castells network society and new public sphere (2004; 2006; 2008), this thesis empirically investigates the role of social media, specifically Facebook, during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Theories and concepts including the strength of weak ties, social movement theory, and Internet and organizational theory, a discussion of recent writings from both sides of the spectrum—those believing social media to hold power and those with the opposite view—inform the theoretical foundation of this thesis. The primary purpose of this thesis is to better understand what power lies in Facebook as used during the Egyptian Revolution. Using a qualitative approach, a methodological frame is employed to examine both the form and content of Facebook posts. This study concludes three major findings regarding the social power of Facebook during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution: the power of attention and momentum, the power of cooperation, and the creation of a repository of information and communication.",1371938943,,Dissertations & Theses," Bowerbank, JoelBowerbankJoelBowerbank, Joel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3006513811 , 78849732 , 66569 , 9780494871966 , MR87196 , MR87196", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9780494871966, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1371938943?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications,, 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," Communication and the arts , Communication , Communicative action , Facebook , Habermass , Political crisis , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Facebook+and+Communicative+Action%3A+The+Power+of+Social+Media+during+the+2011+Egyptian+Revolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bowerbank%2C+Joel&amp;isbn=9780494871966&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"600,"Pleasure, Leisure, or Vice? Public Morality in Imperial Cairo, 1882–1949","I investigate the social history of Egypt under British imperial occupation through the lens of morality in order to understand the contestation of cultural change and authority under empire. Points of cultural cleavage between European and local inhabitants in British-occupied Cairo included two customs, gambling and the consumption of intoxicants, which elicited sustained and dynamic reactions from observers of Egyptian society on the local and international level. I show that the presence of alcohol and gambling in public spaces in Cairo contributed directly to the politicization and selective criminalization of public morality. However, the meanings attributed to social practices relating to leisure were continually under negotiation and challenge as state authorities, British liberals, Egyptian reformers and religious leaders, foreign missionaries, and representatives of international temperance movements vied to impose their visions of morality upon Egyptian society. My work speaks to the questions of how public morality and popular culture are socially defined, and how these contested definitions have shaped, and been shaped by, the colonial encounter in the Middle East. I demonstrate that the struggle over who could claim ultimate cultural or religious authority on a given moral issue was not limited to the realm of ideas and ethics, but had practical and profound ramifications for state politics. In moving my analysis from the market of ideas to the physical market for intoxicating goods and wagering services, I argue that power and authority in Egypt, as in other states under imperial occupation, retained a fluidity that transcended the expression of force or threats of violence. The resiliency of these social issues testifies to the weaknesses of both the British imperial and the Egyptian monarchial states, which were never able to enforce their claims to moral and political authority and effectively exert power over the urban population.

This study investigates the NBA within a broader span of India's political history from 1950 to 2007, and asks the following questions: why did isolated protests in the Narmada Valley for better enforcement of relief and rehabilitation for the displaced families transform into a global movement against development? What explains the unprecedented success of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) during its early years? Thereafter, how might we explain and understand the declining impact of the movement? The conflicts over the project have been analyzed by some scholars as the outcome of the marginalization of tribal and peasant communities by uneven and rapacious economic development (Fisher 1995; Sangvai 2000; D'Souza 2002; Routledge 2003); as an extension of pervasive tribal movements that have historically resisted an expansionary and exploitative colonial and postcolonial state (Baviskar 1995; Gandhi 2003); mobilization of global activists' resources and networks (Khagram 2004; Udall 1995, and Caufield 1996); as interest group politics against the crisis of development (Dwivedi 2006); and as a struggle to resist the ""accumulation by dispossession"" of a neo-liberalizing capitalist state (Nilsen 2010; Whitehead 2010). Yet while scholarship in recent years has attributed significant importance to social movement frames, no scholarly exposition to date has focused on framing as a conceptual tool to understand the course of the NBA. This study argues that the economic and social programs of the Indian (Nehruvian) state were informed by a distinct institutional ideology of development – one that promised economic transformation accompanied by social justice – and that this development ideology furnished key frames that enabled the NBA to mobilize against the dam. To pursue and support this argument, my study is designed as a historical account of a single case, the empirical investigation of which is based on theoretical insights borrowed from scholars across the fields of social movement and development studies. The study centers on a close interrogation of the language of state and movement actors as revealed in a range of state and movement documents, including government five-year plans, policy documents, court verdicts, congressional hearings and media reports. By unpacking certain components of state (Nehruvian) and movement discourses, my historical analysis of the Narmada movement traces the often profound interconnections between state action, movement mobilization and strategic framing across the course of a multi-decade struggle to shape one of the most important development projects of the late 20th century. In doing so, this study shows how movement frames can successfully challenge, at least for a time, what are often seen as hegemonic state ideologies of development. By the same token, however, the study also suggests that state discourses are hardly monolithic or static. State actors rework the basis of political legitimacy, and new state interpretations and articulations of development undermine the power of movement frames (and collective action) to influence the terms and outcomes of the political conflict.",1426182382,,Dissertations & Theses," Thomas, AshaThomasAshaThomas, Asha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3048834791 , 81173122 , 66569 , 9781303229312 , 3568434 , 3568434", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303229312, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1426182382?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0452 Social work , 0615 Political science"," 0332 History , 0452 Social work , 0615 Political science"," 0332 History , 0452 Social work , 0615 Political science",," 0332 History , 0452 Social work , 0615 Political science"," History , Social work , Political science"," Social sciences , Dam , Development studies , Framing , India , Narmada Bachao Andolan , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framing+the+state%3A+Social+movement+in+the+Narmada+Valley&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thomas%2C+Asha&amp;isbn=9781303229312&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"603,"Interrogating Moral Mothers, Mama Grizzlies, and women warriors: Towards a queer transnational feminist antimilitarism","This project examines the neoliberal context and public discourses that have surrounded the ""War on Terror""—specially the rhetorical hijacking of feminism--and the impact on feminist antimilitarism. The primary research for this project was composed of participant observation, interviews, archival analysis, and testimonies of feminist peace activists in the United States. This project weaves activists' voices with the existing theoretical frameworks of activism and with cultural studies analysis of public discourse. The discourse analysis builds from scholarship that establishes that beyond the model and policy of global economic expansion, neoliberalism also profoundly shapes our ideologies through cultural, social, and political acceptance of consumer choice in place of political engagement and individual autonomy in place of social welfare. Through interviews with feminist antimilitarists, it become clear that neoliberalism acts both with and against the agency and identities of social movements; recognizing the influence of neoliberalism in social movements, I investigate the direct action tactics of current antimilitarist activism within feminist organizations operating in the United States, including Women in Black, Code Pink, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. For instance, in my analysis of social networking technologies used by peace activists and the Occupy Wall Street Movement, I argue that there has been a depoliticization of activism through the fetishization of media technology, which both offers new modes of communication and obscures the labor of organizers. In my analysis of Code Pink's demands for a ""peace budget"" in place of a militarist budget, which resists the sexist and racist economics of the shrinking welfare state, I examine how it simultaneously confronts and appropriates the model of neoliberal citizenship that equates tax dollars to a vote. Feminist antimilitarist activism and scholarship complicates the essentialist notion that men are innately militarists and women are pacifists; therefore, they offer a space to interrogate the gendered logics and assumptions about the nature and functioning of contemporary politics. This study of feminist antimilitarist activism in relation to neoliberalism offers new and complex ways of examining how culture engenders militarism and activists' ability to dismantle it.",1426645507,,Dissertations & Theses," Klinker, Mary JoKlinkerJoMaryKlinker, Mary Jo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3050474481 , 81216882 , 66569 , 9781303241352 , 3587124 , 3587124", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303241352, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1426645507?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," American studies , Womens studies , Peace Studies"," Social sciences , Antimilitarism , Feminism , Neoliberalism , Peace activism , Transnational politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interrogating+Moral+Mothers%2C+Mama+Grizzlies%2C+and+women+warriors%3A+Towards+a+queer+transnational+feminist+antimilitarism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klinker%2C+Mary+Jo&amp;isbn=9781303241352&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"604,"""Heritage to Horizons"": The history of the 1977 International Women's Year Conference in South Carolina","In 1977, 800 South Carolinians came together in the state's capital of Columbia for a meeting called ""South Carolina Woman: Heritage to Horizons."" It was one of fifty-six state and territorial meetings held as part of the United States' celebration of International Women's Year (IWY.) These meetings culminated in the National Women's Conference held later that year in Houston, Texas. IWY was a federally-funded initiative to enable American women to discuss their concerns and make recommendations for national policy. It was an outgrowth of a United Nations program to advance the status of women worldwide by encouraging each nation to give women the opportunity to make their voices heard. At the state meetings held in South Carolina and elsewhere, individuals voted on core recommendations and elected delegates to represent the state at the national conference where a National Plan of Action would be adopted to advise Congress and the president on future policy. The meetings proved to be important locations where feminists and social conservatives with drastically different views about what that policy should be competed for influence. Though state meetings followed the same national guidelines and discussed similar issues, each meeting reflected the needs and interests of women in that state. This paper traces the history of the IWY in South Carolina, focusing on the state meeting from its initial planning stages through the meeting that took place June 10 and 11 and culminating in the participation of South Carolina delegates at the national conference. It examines the interactions between South Carolina feminists, including the IWY State Coordinating Committee, and the conservative forces that opposed the women's rights movement and objected to federal sponsorship of the IWY program. Though in some states social conservatives were able to compete successfully with feminists in the voting on delegates and recommendations and in some cases takeover over the meeting, this was not the case in South Carolina. However, the threat from these individuals opposed to changes in gender and race relations was significant enough that the South Carolina Coordinating Committee and other feminists felt it necessary to plan carefully and take preventive action during and after the meeting in order for feminists and a feminist message to be sent to the Houston conference. As a result, all but one of the delegates elected were supporters of the women's movement and the recommendations adopted – including most of those suggested by national IWY leaders -- were feminist in nature. This case study of the ""Heritage to Horizons"" conference in South Carolina contributes to the growing body of scholarship about International Women's Year, an event of great national significance that played out differently in each state and territory. Previously states studied have mostly been those where takeovers took place, leaving a lack of understanding about states where social conservative's opposition did not completely alter the proceedings and outcome of the state meeting. As a result, by studying South Carolina, a greater understanding of what allowed, or in some cases, prevented, social conservatives from having an effect on the IWY can be achieved. This helps us understand the larger meanings of the IWY in a nation dealing with the changes of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, it reveals much about the feminist and social conservatives in South Carolina in the 1970s.",1426849337,,Dissertations & Theses," Mans, CaitlinMansCaitlinMans, Caitlin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3051456141 , 81240362 , 66569 , 9781303289064 , 1543087 , 1543087", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303289064, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1426849337?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Conservatives , Feminism , International Women's Year , New Right , South Carolina , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Heritage+to+Horizons%22%3A+The+history+of+the+1977+International+Women%27s+Year+Conference+in+South+Carolina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mans%2C+Caitlin&amp;isbn=9781303289064&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"605,'Thoughts that Burn but Cannot be Spoken': Re-Imagining the Political within Histories of Feminist Activism,"""'Thoughts that Burn but Cannot be Spoken': Re-Imagining the Political within Histories of Feminist Activism"" is an interdisciplinary cultural study of feminist activism, from 1840 to the present moment, that focuses on exploring how the figure of the feminist activist and her corresponding activist practices are differently imagined in discrete historical moments. Parallel to the history of the 501 (c) 3 non-profit corporation, I move across the disciplines to track how the institutionalization of various forms of activism has differently (re)produced certain kinds of activist subjects whose social imaginaries inform the limitations and possibilities of social movements strategies for social transformation. Rather than constructing a social history of non-profit activism or a sociological study on particular feminist NGOs, my project is interested in tracing how the feminist activist subject is differently imagined in a variety of cultural and institutional domains, ranging from non-profits themselves and academic disciplines, to literary fictions produced in time with social movement activism. More specifically, this project is intent on exploring differing activist sensibilities and ""alternative"" forms of agency particular to black feminist political traditions in and against the current political context dominated by NGO and non-profit activism. In order to expand contemporary political imaginations of anti-racist feminist activism, I strive towards three larger and related ambitions. First, this project resituates the current debates on NGOization and the Non-Profit Industrial Complex (NPIC) within a longer, critical cultural study of anti-racist feminist activism that interrupts the temptation to ahistorically or transhistorically universalize the present regime of NGOization as always the case. In this way, I consider how the NGO and non-profit have produced power accommodating activist subjects to different ends, in order to more broadly consider how institutions in civil society are historically and unevenly imbricated in furthering the expansion of state power. Second, my work to explore now ""alternative"" feminist activist subjects' imaginaries correlates with different theorizations of the relationship between citizens, the state and (global) civil society. In liberal and neoliberal traditions, civil society—and institutions in civil society like the non-profit—are presumed to inhabit a sphere separate from state and economic interests. Turning away from such theories, I follow Antonio Gramsci's work to investigate how institutions in civil society are subject making and world shaping. In a moment where non-profits and NGOs are uncritically celebrated across the disciplines as the most logical mode of social change, and are figured as the preeminent form of political agency for responding to state violence, globalization processes, and inequality at the local, national, and international level, this project considers the distinct ways these institutions are historically (though differently) bound up in what Gramsci calls the ""educative function of the state."" Finally, while I heavily rely on the work of feminist social scientists and social movement histories to think critically about NGOization and corresponding transformations in state power, this dissertation centers on literary production as an alternative site for thinking critically and historically about feminist activism and moreover, for (re)imagining new ways of being political. Reading historically, across disciplinary formations and ""against the grain,"" I position the literary narratives of social movements as invaluable to emerging histories of feminist activism that, under NGOization, are either disappeared, or in some cases even memorialized in the service of legitimizing the dominant political logics of the present.",1428362370,,Dissertations & Theses," Boyd, Kathleen E.BoydE.KathleenBoyd, Kathleen E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3056851591 , 81196622 , 66569 , 9781303268601 , 3588641 , 3588641", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303268601, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428362370?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies"," Modern literature , American studies , Womens studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Antiracist feminist activism , Black feminism , Cultural production , NGOization , Social movement literature , Transformations in state power",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27Thoughts+that+Burn+but+Cannot+be+Spoken%27%3A+Re-Imagining+the+Political+within+Histories+of+Feminist+Activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boyd%2C+Kathleen+E.&amp;isbn=9781303268601&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"606,Reconstructing the Rural: Peasant Organizations in a Chinese Movement for Alternative Development,"This ethnography examines four peasant organizations affiliated with New Rural Reconstruction (NRR), an ongoing alternative development movement in China. NRR consists of a diverse network involving hundreds of organizations, loosely united by the goals of reversing the rural-to-urban flow of resources and ""(re)constructing"" sustainable, self-sufficient communities based on cooperation among peasant households, supported by agroecological skill-sharing and alternative marketing. While many NRR advocates draw ideas and inspiration from China's Rural Reconstruction Movement of the 1930s, the movement is better understood as a Chinese and postsocialist counterpart to the global wave of responses to neoliberalism associated with the Global Justice Movement (GJM). Both NRR and the GJM could be characterized as predominantly alternativist in their focus on fostering ""alternative"" economic forms (neither capitalist nor socialist), such as co-ops and ""fair trade"" networks. Another commonality with NRR is the GJM's revival of ""the peasantry"" as a central political subject. In contrast with mid-20 th century Third Worldism, NRR and the GJM represent the peasantry as primarily oriented not toward modernization, but the defense or revival of traditional lifeways now valued as more sustainable than either capitalist or socialist models of industrial development. I argue that, under present conditions, ""success"" at reversing the rural-to-urban flow of resources through commercial means tends to require further integration into capitalist processes, both increasing vulnerability to global economic forces and undermining values such as equality, sustainability, and participatory democracy. On the other hand, these values continue to distinguish NRR-affiliated organizations from conventional capitalist enterprises, creating tensions that point toward possibilities of confrontation with their broader social conditions. I thus engage critically with economic anthropology and the interdisciplinary literature on alternative economic forms, peasant cooperation, ""culture,"" and ""value(s)."" Drawing on a critical return to Marx in light of the failures of 20 th century Marxisms, I introduce the concept of ""alternativism"" and a focus on the tension between alternative values and the capitalist form of commodity value. These innovations contribute to anthropological theory by providing tools for dealing with the post-1960s ""epistemic impasse"" of global political thought and the post-1990s situation, in which capital seems to be excluding an increasing portion of the peasant and semi-proletarian bodies it continues to dispossess from complete integration into wage relations, which Marx had seen as the fulcrum of capitalist society's self-overcoming",1428426369,,Dissertations & Theses," Hale, Matthew A.HaleA.MatthewHale, Matthew A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3057069931 , 80253552 , 66569 , 9781303269769 , 3588702 , 3588702", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303269769, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428426369?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0511 Economic theory"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0511 Economic theory"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0511 Economic theory",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0344 Social research , 0511 Economic theory"," Asian Studies , Social research , Economic theory"," Social sciences , Alternative development , Anthropology , Capitalism , China , Cooperatives , Development , Rural organizations , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reconstructing+the+Rural%3A+Peasant+Organizations+in+a+Chinese+Movement+for+Alternative+Development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hale%2C+Matthew+A.&amp;isbn=9781303269769&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"607,"""A Mass Conspiracy To Feed People"" Globalizing Cities, World-Class Waste, and the Biopolitics of Food Not Bombs","This is an ethnography of waste, cities, and social movements. Primarily one social movement in particular, Food Not Bombs, which recovers and freely redistributes wasted food in the public spaces of hundreds of cities, in dozens of countries, on every continent except Antarctica. In the process, chapters contest highly polarised geographies of hunger, homelessness, and public space in these places. This dissertation explores three aspects of Food Not Bombs' context and cultural logic: (1) the ways in which waste is made and moved about in cities; (2) the ways in which those cities are becoming global in the process of waste-making (and vice versa); and (3) the ways in which this globalised waste-making cultivates globalised forms of social organisation and political resistance. This research has consisted of extensive participant-observation within Food Not Bombs chapters and some of the larger political and cultural communities in which they are embedded—Dumpster-divers, squatters, homeless advocates, punks, anarchists, and so on—in Seattle, New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Melbourne, Australia, and several other cities. It describes the link between urban globalisation and the proliferation of Food Not Bombs chapters, many of which have been located in ""global"" cities whose post-industrial economies are intimately entangled in global circuits of elite business investment, high-end consumption, and tourism. Each of these cities generates a wealth of world-class waste: food wasted in the interests of commodity aesthetics, buildings left empty for the sake of property speculation and gentrification, and so on. This waste, and the disparities and deprivations that correspond to it (hunger, homelessness, etcetera), are the material and political preconditions of Food Not Bombs' work. Broadly speaking, then, this dissertation describes a sort of abject symbiosis between the development of such globalised cities and the politically resistant work of Food Not Bombs.",1428427713,,Dissertations & Theses," Giles, David Henry Galen BoarderGilesHenry Galen BoarderDavidGiles, David Henry Galen Boarder",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3057065571 , 80253452 , 66569 , 9781303269554 , 3588687 , 3588687", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303269554, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428427713?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy"," American studies , Cultural anthropology , Geography , Public policy"," Social sciences , Food Not Bombs , Food security , Global cities , Network ethnography , Social movements , Urban ethnography , Waste",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22A+Mass+Conspiracy+To+Feed+People%22+Globalizing+Cities%2C+World-Class+Waste%2C+and+the+Biopolitics+of+Food+Not+Bombs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Giles%2C+David+Henry+Galen+Boarder&amp;isbn=9781303269554&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"608,Networked Identifications: Constructing Identities and Ideologies in the 2009 Iranian Election Protests,"This dissertation explores the strategic formation of counter-hegemonic discourses during social movements and their rescaling through mobile social media across networked, translocal public spheres. Through an interdisciplinary approach drawing on critical discourse analysis, communication studies, and social movement theory, this qualitative research focuses on the discursive constructions of identities and ideologies during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests. Examining activists' discursive tactics in a corpus of Twitter tweets, Flickr photo uploads, and YouTube videos and comparing them with the interdiscursive strategies of U.S. legacy news media texts, I argue that Iranian activists' use of social media and English add to the micronarratives of vernacular globalization while also calling into question Western master narratives about Iran. I also argue that activists' reflexive discursive practices and symbolic reentextualizations help form transnational sociomental bonds that strengthen collective actors' sense of solidarity, though at the risk of informationalizing their borrowed discourses and constraining their political stance-taking to the level of affect. While the use of new media in recent social movements has attracted scholarly attention in various fields, much of it has been in quantitative and network-mapping studies. This project seeks, therefore, to address the relative lack of qualitative, microlevel perspectives on new media discursive practices in social movements while also engaging arguments on the discursive relationships between cyber-rhetoric and democracy promotion as well as present understandings of how new media discourses shape globalized vernaculars of English.",1428433871,,Dissertations & Theses," Featherman, Christopher M.FeathermanM.ChristopherFeatherman, Christopher M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3057068031 , 81351002 , 66569 , 9781303269349 , 3588675 , 3588675", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303269349, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428433871?accountid=14496," 0636 Sociolinguistics , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0636 Sociolinguistics , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0636 Sociolinguistics , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0636 Sociolinguistics , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," Sociolinguistics , Language , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Discourse analysis , Election protests , Globalization , Iran , Mobilities , Social cognition , Social media , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Networked+Identifications%3A+Constructing+Identities+and+Ideologies+in+the+2009+Iranian+Election+Protests&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Featherman%2C+Christopher+M.&amp;isbn=9781303269349&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"609,Positioning indigeneity: Articulating Beinan and Han identities in a heterogeneous community in Taiwan,"This dissertation addresses global, national, and local levels of indigeneity and highlights their nodes of dissension in Taiwan. First, it investigates how the development of indigenous movements and legislation worldwide has influenced indigenous movements and laws at the national level. It further traces how national legislation of indigenous rights have affected local indigenous movements and how various local indigenous subjects have responded at the international and global levels. This dissertation draws on Stuart Hall’s theoretical concepts of ‘positioning’ and ‘articulation' (also elaborated by Jennifer Slack, Tania Li and James Clifford). I conceptualize indigeneity, tribe, and culture as social formations to avoid being tripped up by essentialist and reductionist formulations. Ethnographically, this dissertation positions local Beinan Chulu protests in their historical contexts. I show how the protests are intertwined with the formation of Beinan ethnicity and the Chulu tribe. I adopt a macro-perspective on the politics of multiculturalism and indigeneity in discussing the controversial development of the Taiwan state. I also examine the microcosm of Beinan and Han households, their cultural and economic entanglements, and changing spatial and social meanings of the Chulu community. Mapping the details of the emerging Chulu Beinan subjectivity echoes Hall’s call for an end of innocence. In Taiwan and among the Chulu, this means the end of the notion of an essential indigenous subject and the beginning of a more dialogic understanding and constructive interactions between indigenous and non-indigenous subjects. Finally, this dissertation contends that long-term anthropological fieldwork is an important method for investigating indigenous movements. I found that long-term ethnographic fieldwork enabled me to represent the real face of Chulu's heterogenous community without keeping Chulu Beinan in an indigenous slot or sustaining a fiction of absolute oppositions between Beinan and Han.",1430294793,,Dissertations & Theses," Huang, Li-JenHuangLi-JenHuang, Li-Jen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3063492091 , 77933382 , 66569 , 9781303313325 , 3572426 , 3572426", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303313325, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430294793?accountid=14496," 0324 Archaeology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0324 Archaeology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0324 Archaeology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0324 Archaeology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Archaeology , Cultural anthropology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Beinan , China , Cultural revitalization , Han , Indigeneity , Indigenous movement , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Positioning+indigeneity%3A+Articulating+Beinan+and+Han+identities+in+a+heterogeneous+community+in+Taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huang%2C+Li-Jen&amp;isbn=9781303313325&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"610,"Quiet Confrontations: Transnational Advocacy Networks, Local Churches, and the Pursuit of Religious Freedoms in China","My dissertation project explores the question of how activist networks operate in a highly repressive country when outside intervention is restrained. People have seen how effectively the Chinese Communist Party has cracked down on transnational religious activisms sponsored by Falun Gong, the exiled Tibetan government, and the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, Protestant advocacy groups from the United States and elsewhere enter China each year, despite the fact that the Party has stated that no Chinese church is allowed to receive any form of foreign support. I argue that understanding this variation in the success of transnational religious networks sheds light on the significance of an approach to transnational collaboration that is quite different from the ""naming and shaming"" strategy that dominates the literature on advocacy networks. I tested this strategic alliance argument with a mixed-methods research design, including face-to-face interviews, participant observations in four major cities, and a cross-provincial phone survey in randomly selected prefectures. This project makes notable corrections to previous understanding about protecting minority groups in authoritarian states. First, it addresses the neglect of religion and religious activists in the scholarship on transnational social movements and activism. Second, the strategic collaboration that is demonstrated by religious activists and advocates provides an alternative to the ""naming and shaming"" strategy of conventional transnational activism that more or less relies on powerful Western states and the United Nations. Third, the project identifies two commonly overlooked causal mechanisms between effective activism and its networks: the alliance strategy of foreign advocates and the leverage provided by government-sponsored social entities. The role of government-sponsored social organizations has been largely ignored in the existing literature. Members from legal entities often help fragile advocacy networks by providing information, legal protection, and connections, while brokering acquiescence from pragmatic local officials. In return, the advocacy networks provide funding, services and, most importantly, necessary legitimacy from globally recognized norms and standards. This unique benefit makes local leaders who ally with the advocacy networks seem more legitimate in the eyes of their own constituency.",1430901980,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, YunWangYunWang, Yun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3066578241 , 81551872 , 66569 , 9781303293108 , 3590083 , 3590083", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303293108, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430901980?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0318 Religion , 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science"," Religion , Asian Studies , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , China , Human rights , Protestantism , Registered and unregistered churches , Religious freedom , Transnational advocacy network",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Quiet+Confrontations%3A+Transnational+Advocacy+Networks%2C+Local+Churches%2C+and+the+Pursuit+of+Religious+Freedoms+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Yun&amp;isbn=9781303293108&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"611,"The provocative cocktail: Intellectual origins of the Zapatista uprising, 1960–1994","Drawing on critical currents in the study of contentious politics and the formation of class, racial and political identities, this dissertation seeks to account for the intellectual origins and global resonance of Zapatismo, the distinctive political discourse and practices of the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (Zapatista National Liberation Army or EZLN) in Chiapas, Mexico. It is an historical sociological case study that combines archival research and interviews with participants in, and observers of, the indigenous campesino movement in Chiapas to construct an intellectual history of the indigenous Mayan communities that form the EZLN's bases of popular support. It elaborates a theoretical account of anti-systemic social movements and other forms of contentious politics as expressions of what Marx called the realization of ""species being,"" ""the real movement which abolishes the present state of things"" or communism. The study finds that the training of catechists by the Diocese of San Cristóbal de Las Casas produced a layer of organic indigenous campesino intellectuals who became first the leaders of the indigenous campesino movement and later of the EZLN. The study argues that Zapatismo is a product not only of transformations in the political economy of Chiapas and Mexico but of a process of emergent collective revolutionary political subjectivity on the part of the indigenous communities that occurred in the context of a global crisis in revolutionary theory arising out of the contradictory experiences of the socialist revolutions of the 20 th century. Specifically the study argues that Zapatismo is a synthesis of proto-communist elements from the traditional religious worldview of their communities, the liberation theology of the Diocese, the Maoism of several organizations that assisted the communities in the construction of independent peasant organizations, and the left-wing revolutionary nationalism of the EZLN's parent organization, the Fuerzas de Liberación Nacional (FLN) inspired by the Cuban and Nicaraguan Revolutions.

I take special interest in community organizing around spoken word's relevance for youth, illuminating a popular education approach that invests in young people's voices, knowledge, and histories. Spoken word is a form of radical youth development that connects young people to social movement work and, inherently, a cultural intervention to youth violence. Based on fieldwork between 2007 and 2010, I historicize and explore spoken word as a cultural, multiracial site of politics and pedagogy in order to expose and substantiate the social possibilities that emerge from this specific framework, location, and application of critical literacy. Community-organized spaces resulting from spoken word activism - ranging from after-school writing workshops, school residencies, and school clubs, to teen poetry slams, youth open mic, and hip hop theater - work to change the social and historical conditions of young people towards more deeply democratic opportunities and social futures. Social transformation of this scale stems from civic engagement inspired through arts-based literacy and pedagogy, as well as the sustained, intentional community arts activism and U.S.-based and transnational networks that are constitutive of the cultural movement of spoken word. By emphasizing spoken word organizing in the Bay Area, I reveal a local case, articulation, and trajectory of this movement. Spoken word is a cultural movement because of how its practices and communities shift discourse significantly and deeply for young people, including those whom educational and social institutions historically have failed to reach and serve. Evidence of spoken word as a movement can be exemplified by the international youth poetry slam festival known as Brave New Voices, which provides a window into, and represents a culmination of, at least 50 other local spoken word-based, youth literary arts programs or community efforts that have been established or are emerging outside of the Bay Area. At the heart of this movement work are safe, uncensored spaces for dialogue to occur by and among youth, whose praxis of authorship and craft of narrative take root in the struggles, triumphs, pleasures, and pains of their everyday lives - giving new expressions to ""the personal is political."" As a result of these spaces, young people not only demonstrate and cultivate aesthetic maturity and social responsibility in their writing and performance. They also witness and exercise the transgressive power and discursive potential of words and collective uplift through the use and interaction of their own voices. What spoken word pedagogy brings into view is the efflorescence of a new generation of writers, arts activists, critical educators, community organizers, and social and political leaders. In short, spoken word pedagogy is the persistent, deliberate, and ongoing arts activism and community organizing of this cultural movement presently in the making.",1430910356,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Ruth H.KimH.RuthKim, Ruth H.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3066680951 , 81555562 , 66569 , 9781303278488 , 3589334 , 3589334", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303278488, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430910356?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," Political science , Ethnic studies , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Arts , California , Community organizing , Cultural movement , Literacy , Political activism , Spoken word , Youth of color",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spoken+art+pedagogies%3A+Youth%2C+critical+literacy+%26amp%3B+a+cultural+movement+in+the+making&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Ruth+H.&amp;isbn=9781303278488&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"613,When repression is not enough: The policing and social control of Occupy Oakland,"Occupy Oakland was best known for its radical politics, disruptiveness, militancy and confrontations with police from the fall of 2011 until early 2012. As an active participant I experiences police repression and also witnessed the collapse of social control - most dramatically with the November 2, 2011 General Strike - that shut down the Port of Oakland and much of downtown and stemmed largely from police aggression and misconduct the previous week. After briefly establishing how social control broke down in Oakland, California in the fall of 2011, in Chapter 1, I trace the various techniques of policing and social control that demobilized the movement in the remainder of the dissertation. I examine the legal, political, and socio-cultural contexts that shaped the movement and its policing, examining the role of legitimacy and force in evaluating the forms of social control that help determine the effectiveness of specific police practices. The dissertation draws mainly from hundreds of hours of participant observation and various primary documents (declassified local and federal police documents and reports, legal filings, public police planning documents, mainstream news coverage, and city press releases). Chapter 2 lays out much of the theoretical contribution of the dissertation, focusing primarily on the two major literatures on protest policing. Drawing from my research on Occupy Oakland, I argue that the two main methods of modern protest policing in the Global North, defined by either police-protester cooperation or preemptive police aggression, are not only related (in contrast to much of the existing literature), they are mutually constituted. The raid on Occupy Oakland's second encampment in mid-November 2011 was one of many raids across the country. In Chapter 2, I take a wider lens to examine the policing of the national movement in this specific moment and the role of federal and non-governmental agencies in coordinating encampment raids in eighteen cities across the U.S. in a two-week period. I specifically focus on the use of health and security discourses that aided in the depoliticization of policing in this moment. I examine the role of permits, the law, and police force in Chapter 4, utilizing a genealogical approach to understanding the law and police tactics in Oakland. A defining characteristic of Occupy Oakland was its rejection of negotiation with the city and police, including seeking protest permits. A permit was nevertheless taken out for after the second camp eviction in Oscar Grant Plaza. I illustrate how the police and city administrators use civil law as a mechanism to profile specific communities and control geographic space, comparing the laws and policing practices associated with gang injunctions and the permit in Oakland. Chapter 5 examines the political discourses of movement criminalization which preceded and followed Occupy Oakland's January 28, 2012 effort occupy the vacant Kaiser Convention Center. Illustrating the overall arch of the movement and the various efforts to control it, this chapter illustrates how the same set of police tactics that created great public support for the movement and condemnation of the police four months earlier, had a very different meaning and impact on protest (de)mobilization in late-January 2012. I argue that the policing and political delegitimation of the movement in this moment marked a clear turning point towards the movement's eventual collapse. I conclude that we must seek a more holistic approach to understanding the policing of protest that examines but goes beyond police tactics and strategies to the political, legal and socio-cultural contexts in which they are embedded. I argue that ultimately it is these factors of perceived legitimacy, public support, and active solidarity and participation that determine the effect of various forms of policing, and either foster social change or reinforce the existing social order.",1430911239,,Dissertations & Theses," King, Michael J.KingJ.MichaelKing, Michael J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3066680961 , 81555572 , 66569 , 9781303278471 , 3589335 , 3589335", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303278471, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430911239?accountid=14496," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure"," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure"," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure",," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure"," Criminology , Social structure"," Social sciences , California , Oakland , Occupy , Policing , Protest , Social control , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+repression+is+not+enough%3A+The+policing+and+social+control+of+Occupy+Oakland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=King%2C+Michael+J.&amp;isbn=9781303278471&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"614,"Recovering Adrián del Valle's ""Por el camino"" and building transnational mutlitudinous communities","This dissertation is a recovery project, and as such it introduces Adrián del Valle, a prolific Spanish-born literary modernista and anarchist activist who dedicated his life to social reform in in turn-of-the-century Cuba and beyond. In addition to a critical introduction, this project includes my translation of his 1907 collection of integrated short stories Por el camino [ Along the Way ], which, as all of his works, is long out of print. Por el camino complicates critical models grounded in nationality and therefore invites us to construct and apply an alternative model better suited to handling a transnational epistemology of space, which allows for the constant flow of people, ideas, and texts, as well as commercial and political influences, across borders. In developing this epistemological framework, I blend two theoretical concepts—""multitude"" and ""imagined communities""—to situate del Valle in his dynamic historical moment. Del Valle wrote Por el camino in the throes of the Second Industrial Revolution, the Age of Synergy, which I argue can be understood as an early age of globalization. Por el camino also stands at the crossroads of Latin American modernista short fiction and the international anarchist movement, thus challenging critical positions that treat modernismo as an apolitical and socially apathetic literary movement obsessed with elitist aesthetics and escapism and anarchism as a mutually exclusive movement wholly concerned with achieving practical social and political reforms. Through my reading of del Valle's work, I demonstrate that modernismo and anarchism are two manifold and simultaneous responses to the complex socio-political, economic, cultural, and spiritual crises that grew out of Latin America's transition into modernity.",1432226009,,Dissertations & Theses," Thomson, Shane L.ThomsonL.ShaneThomson, Shane L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3071146911 , 81659042 , 66569 , 9781303301001 , 3590433 , 3590433", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303301001, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1432226009?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Latin American literature , Caribbean literature , Latin American Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Anarchism , Cuba , Modernismo , Multitudinous communities , Por el camino , Valle, Adrian del",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Recovering+Adri%C3%A1n+del+Valle%27s+%22Por+el+camino%22+and+building+transnational+mutlitudinous+communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thomson%2C+Shane+L.&amp;isbn=9781303301001&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"615,The 2008 Candlelight Protest in South Korea: Articulating the Paradox of Resistance in Neoliberal Globalization,"My dissertation is a speculative analysis of the historical contexts of a social protest, based on the notion of ""articulation"" advanced in the field of cultural studies. Focusing on the 2008 candlelight protest against U.S. beef in South Korea, my goal is to explore the historical contexts of the protest, which formulate the identity of the protest. Since the U.S. beef deal was approved by the Korean government as a precondition for the Free Trade Agreement between Korea and the United States, the protest has been considered (notably by leftists in Korea) as a resistance against post-colonial overtones and fascist eco-political principle in the era of neoliberal globalization. Instead of understanding the protest from such an essentialist perspective, my research makes a commitment to exploring the exterior factors that drove the possibility of the protest. The notion of articulation, a mode of explanation that moves beyond any linear sort of causality, provides a framework to view the protest not as a unity, but as a linkage of multi-dimensional (political, economic, social, and cultural) elements of historical contexts. Based on my journal entries written during my participation in the protest, and the journal articles about the 2008 protest written by the scholars in Korea, I explored the main characteristics of the protest in comparison with the conventional social movements in Korea, and discovered that the 2008 candlelight protest had featured the ""food safety issue,"" ""participants with heterogeneous desires,"" ""carnivalesque modality,"" and an ""ambiguous goal."" From these main features, I inferred four salient axes of historical vectors (and their forces) including ""political democratization and depoliticization,"" ""food industrialization and wellbeing fever,"" ""market liberalization and job insecurity,"" and ""advanced communication technology and carnivalesque culture."" My research findings present that the 2008 candlelight protest is not a definite insurgent element calling for any deep change in the dominant political and economic paradigm, but exists as a paradoxical event at the cusp between subordination to and resistance against neoliberal globalization. The main contribution of my research project entails (1) pushing the boundaries of communication studies on social resistance by including the notion of articulation which situates the 2008 candlelight protest within its historical contexts, (2) developing speculative analysis as a critical and cultural studies method for exploring structural forces operating in deep layers of our experiences, (3) delineating the new modalities of contemporary social movements by examining the concrete textures and hues of the 2008 candlelight protest, and (4) offering new ways of (re)thinking the principles of efficiency and economic growth by interrogating a case of food industrialization and global exchange.",1433825337,,Dissertations & Theses," Pang, HuikyongPangHuikyongPang, Huikyong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3075182251 , 77850892 , 66569 , 9781303311970 , 3590956 , 3590956", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303311970, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1433825337?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0459 Communication , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0459 Communication , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0459 Communication , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science"," Communication , Pacific Rim Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Free trade agreements , Globalization , Mad cow disease , Social protests , South Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+2008+Candlelight+Protest+in+South+Korea%3A+Articulating+the+Paradox+of+Resistance+in+Neoliberal+Globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pang%2C+Huikyong&amp;isbn=9781303311970&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"616,Communication networks for social mobilization in marginalized populations: The case of the antimining Mayan movement in Guatemala,"This study analyzes the role of networked communication for social mobilization in marginalized populations. Although the potential of the new technologies to build networks and mobilize power has been shown in empirical research (e.g., Castells, 2007; Juris, 2008), the empowerment of citizens to use these networked communications effectively cannot be taken for granted. Marginalization conditions, such as poverty, sociopolitical exclusion, and limited access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) may affect people's capability to successfully use networked communication to voice their demands. Using a combination of qualitative methodologies, this research develops a case study of the Mayan movement against mining and natural resources exploitation in Guatemala to examine under which conditions excluded populations, such as rural indigenous communities, use networked communication to mobilize power. Specifically, ethnographic research was conducted from November 2011 to December 2012 in Mayan communities in the Western highlands, where the movement has mainly developed. Results show that Mayan communities in Guatemala have implemented networked communication using self-tailored, integrated communication toolboxes containing a combination of interpersonal, traditional, and digital media that respond to their goals and cultural values. Networked communication has proved crucial to the development of strategies in two ways: a) internal strategies, empowering communities despite their marginalization through strategic outputs, such as resource sharing, citizen journalism, and collective action coordination; and b) external strategies, articulating support with allies at a local, national and international level to gather external resources, exert more pressure to influence elites' decisions, and to get protection against political persecution. Networked communication was found to be successful in furthering mobilization goals within the movement, but limited in influencing decision making outside the movement. On one hand, networked communication showed empowers marginalized communities, reinforcing key mobilization aspects, such as group cohesion, collective efficacy, and social capital. Moreover, networks are used as a strategy of pressure and self-protection, aiming to gain support internationally to exert more pressure and get protection nationally. On the other hand, repressive measures used by political elites in Guatemala limit the opportunities of the Mayan communities to further their mobilization goals. Ineffective dialogue and political persecution against indigenous leaders dull the potential of the Mayan movement to influence corporate and political decision-making, resulting in increasing social conflict, violence, and even deaths, consequentially harming the already fledging Guatemalan democracy. This investigation concludes proposing a ""decalogue of empowering networked communication"" for mobilization in marginalized communities based on the Mayan case that may be applied in populations under similar conditions in other sites of the world (i.e., emergent democracies, developing countries, multicultural societies).",1439925374,,Dissertations & Theses," GarciaRuano, Karina J.GarciaRuanoJ.KarinaGarciaRuano, Karina J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3091867191 , 78673652 , 66569 , 9781303348099 , 3592962 , 3592962", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303348099, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1439925374?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0740 Native American studies"," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0740 Native American studies"," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0740 Native American studies",," 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0740 Native American studies"," Communication , Web Studies , Social structure , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Antimining , Environment , Global movements , Guatemala , Information and communication technologies , Latin America , Mayan , Rural sociology , Social networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communication+networks+for+social+mobilization+in+marginalized+populations%3A+The+case+of+the+antimining+Mayan+movement+in+Guatemala&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=GarciaRuano%2C+Karina+J.&amp;isbn=9781303348099&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"617,Structures of grace: Catholic nongovernmental organizations and the mission of the church,"Transnational Catholic nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are among the most active agents in the promotion of the global common good as they seek to overcome the structures of sin that divide the human family. This dissertation investigates the theological and ethical significance of Catholic NGOs by developing a critical framework that uncovers the relationship between these organizations and the church's mission. Part One considers the global context and theoretical foundations of Catholic NGO action by examining social scientific literature (Chapter One) and modern Catholic teaching on the relationship between mission and justice (Chapter Two). Part Two places the theoretical foundations into dialogue with two case studies—the International Movement of Catholic Students-Pax Romana (Chapter Three) and the Jesuit Refugee Service (Chapter Four). This critical investigation of both theory and praxis illuminates several missiological, pneumatological, and ethical conclusions that are addressed in the final part (Chapter Five). This dissertation asserts three conclusions regarding the theological signifigance of Catholic NGOs. First, in contrast to some interpretations of the role of the church in the world, the actions of Catholic NGOs for the global common good are an integral part of the church's mission. Second, these organizations can be described as structures of grace as they embody charity and charism in their efforts to overcome the divisive effects of structural sin. Finally, a more robust awareness of the theological dimensions of their work can aid these and other organizations respond more effectively and ethically to the demands of the global common good today.",1440110688,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahern, Kevin J.AhernJ.KevinAhern, Kevin J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3092755531 , 77718602 , 66569 , 9781303350924 , 3593024 , 3593024", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303350924, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1440110688?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations"," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations"," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations",," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations"," Ethics , Theology , International Relations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Catholic , International Catholic Movement for Intellectual and Cultural Affairs (Pax , International Movement of Catholic Students (Pax Romana) , Jesuit Refugee Service , Mission , Nongovernmental organizations (NGO) , Structures of grace",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Structures+of+grace%3A+Catholic+nongovernmental+organizations+and+the+mission+of+the+church&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahern%2C+Kevin+J.&amp;isbn=9781303350924&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"618,The View from the Table: An Analysis of Participant Reaction to Community-Based Dialogues on Food and Justice,"While Portland, Oregon's sustainable food movement wins accolades for explicitly situating itself in opposition to the industrialized global food system, it often fails to address systems of oppression that are reproduced within the alternative agri-food movement itself. This demonstrated aversion towards the messy, complex, contingent nature of the social world reflects larger processes of ""de-politicization"" of the overall sustainability agenda, which leads to the favoring of technological and/or spatial solutions that may undermine the social equity and justice dimensions of the ""triple bottom line."" This thesis focuses on an action research project involving a series of community dialogues that provided participants with a common language and understanding necessary to interrogate issues of race and class in Portland's sustainable food movement while developing visions for possible futures. Dialogue participants may find new ways to communicate, learn, identify common goals and best practices, and potentially network, collaborate and/or co-produce transformative anti-oppression strategies that integrate into the sustainable food movement. By asking those vested in the sustainable food movement to interrogate dimensions of anti-oppression consciousness, the movement becomes fortified with voices better equipped to envision sustainability within a more political and contingent reality that recognizes conflicts of power, and less resembling an idyllic, utopian, and ultimately impossible sustainability. This thesis delivers some preliminary outcomes following the dialogue series by describing and reflecting on the series' implementation and processes, and reflecting on its impact on participants' anti-oppression consciousness in the context of food and sustainability, while discussing possibilities for future scholarship.",1441081462,,Dissertations & Theses," Turner, JenniferTurnerJenniferTurner, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3095358021 , 78607902 , 66569 , 9781303368240 , 1544954 , 1544954", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303368240, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1441081462?accountid=14496, 0640 Sustainability, 0640 Sustainability, 0640 Sustainability,, 0640 Sustainability, Sustainability," Social sciences , Action research , Agonism , Food justice , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+View+from+the+Table%3A+An+Analysis+of+Participant+Reaction+to+Community-Based+Dialogues+on+Food+and+Justice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turner%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9781303368240&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"619,"Race, Space, and Contestation: Gentrification in San Francisco's Latina/o Mission District, 1998-2002","From 1995 to 2005, the San Francisco Bay Area underwent quick and rapid changes as the forces of the ""New Economy,"" particularly those connected to internet related businesses, pushed the region's economic engine at warp speed. San Francisco power brokers recognized the economic power of these new internet related firms and worked to lure and retain this new economic force to and within the city. By 1998, their efforts, along with other forces, created an uneven spatial distribution of internet related firms in San Francisco's eastern quadrant, a historically working-class area of the city. The encroachment of these internet related firms into eastern quadrant neighborhoods like the Mission District, a working-class and predominantly Latina/o area of the city, also brought gentrification. Between 1998 and 2002, the time focus of this dissertation, the upward trend that the ""New Economy"" had been experiencing since 1995, hit its peak before falling back to earth. During this same time, the pressures of gentrification that had been impacting Mission District residents since 1995 also hit its peak. Commercial, manufacturing and light-industrial space was being converted apace into office space, live-work lofts, and luxury condominiums. Residential evictions in the Mission District easily outpaced those in other parts of the city during this four year stretch as local real estate firms jumped into speculative real estate deals. The displacement of local industries and people combined contributed to significant residential and commercial shifts in the Mission District. In 1998, Mission District activists and residents formally began an anti-displacement movement. This movement, which found its most potent expression in the working-class Latina/o Mission District before radiating out to other San Francisco neighborhoods, demonstrates the need to understand better the importance of space and place for social movement actors. The Mission District's claim for spatial and social justice also highlights three key themes for social movement scholarship: collective consumption, cultural identity, and political self- management. In the Mission District these three dimensions showed themselves through a geographic struggle over the protection of livable space, the culturally and racially relevant form of protest within a place based identity formation, and efforts to gain greater community control over city planning processes and decision-making procedures. As much as this dissertation examines a social movement, it also expands on the cultural forms of spatialized and geographically scaled protest activity. The latter two are brought to bear through the resistive efforts of a grassroots led community movement that struggled to create, challenge, and reproduce cultural meanings of place that are absolutely inscribed in our socio-spatial landscape. The close focus of this dissertation on a single community movement within one neighborhood in San Francisco highlights larger issues of concern. How normalized processes such as privatization, and gentrification play out across major urban centers of late capitalist society reveals an intense struggle by those displaced as well as those profiting from the changes. While gentrification may be most visible at the local scale, it would be a mistake to not also understand its connecting threads to larger regional and global forces. As such, viewing gentrification through a multi-scaled lens allows one to view the nuanced impacts of larger global neoliberal tendencies and logics in actually existing places (Brenner &amp; Theodore, 2002). These larger tendencies and logics have made the outcomes of contemporary gentrification – further displacement, dislocation and general marginalization of the urban working-class – a durable part of a larger socio-spatial landscape that for so many produces the interruption and/or destruction of everyday life. This project is situated in larger theoretical issues of organized abandonment, ""landscape,"" mobility/immobility, and the racialized/spatialized outcomes of short-sighted spatial fixes to crises. This project also demonstrates how these unevenly developed landscapes carry the necessary elements for the creation of spatial justice, and the features necessary for ""geographies of justice"", features that extend beyond the local scale, having fluid interplay at varying scales.",1441337650,,Dissertations & Theses," Casique, Francisco DiazCasiqueDiazFranciscoCasique, Francisco Diaz",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3096294141 , 82221052 , 66569 , 9781303371226 , 3593747 , 3593747", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303371226, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1441337650?accountid=14496," 0604 Regional Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0604 Regional Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0604 Regional Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0604 Regional Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Regional Studies , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Gentrification , Latina/o , Mission District , New Economy , San Francisco Bay Area , Working class",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Race%2C+Space%2C+and+Contestation%3A+Gentrification+in+San+Francisco%27s+Latina%2Fo+Mission+District%2C+1998-2002&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Casique%2C+Francisco+Diaz&amp;isbn=9781303371226&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"620,"The 1944 Ili movement: Political opportunity, framing process and international relations in revolution","This research utilizes the 1944 Ili movement as a case study to explore the dynamics and mobilization processes of revolutionary movements. In November 1944, a powerful movement occurred in the Ili area, Xinjiang, China. Launched by Turkic Muslims in three districts of the Ili, Tarbaghatay and Altay, this movement rapidly swept through the entire region, changed the political system, and resulted in the establishment of a new government. This research specifically examines how political opportunities, movement organizations, framing process, collective representation and international relations join together to impact the dynamics of the Ili movement. Methods include the analysis of movement pamphlets, the international relations denouements, and memoires of movement leaders, complemented by interviews and talks with the witnesses and informants, and narrative histories written in Uyghur, English and Chinese. Findings demonstrate that the confluence of macro-, meso-, and micromobilization processes as well as the combined impacts of collective representation and international relations are responsible for the emergence, development and decline of the Ili movement. On the macro and meso levels, the 1944 Ili movement is the outcome of domestic and international political opportunities through movement leaders’ conscious strategies of activating, organizing and mobilizing the actors. On a micro level, this movement was the outcome of the bridged movement frames such as “We Turk”, one God principle, oppression, and friendship with the Soviet Union. During the mobilization processes, the movement was facilitated by spiritual politics of Islam and its sacred cultural repertoire. Sacred cultural repertoire is a new sociological concept developed in this research fusing Durkheimian concept of sacred/profane and Swidler’s concept of cultural repertoire. It refers to the strategy for mobilization in the name of the sacred. Sacred cultural repertoire serves, vitalizes and characterizes almost all Islamic movements. The Ili movement is a good example. Findings in this study imply that: (1) no single perspective on social movement can best account for the dynamics and unique characteristics of revolutionary movements; the macro-, meso-, micro-mobilization processes must be equally examined; (2) the master frame and sacred cultural repertoire are anchored in the collective representation; (3) the dynamics of revolutionary movements largely depends on combining influence from five factors: political process, movement organization, effective framing, collective representation and international relations; (4) shifts in the political opportunity structure effect the organizations and resources. Movement ideologies, organizations develop dialectically through political process, and determine the construction of movement frame. International conditions indirectly impact the development of political process; (5) even if a revolutionary movement fails, it would facilitate the formation of collective identity.",1441353578,,Dissertations & Theses," Zulifeikeer, BalatiZulifeikeerBalatiZulifeikeer, Balati",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3096396791 , 81351392 , 66569 , 9781303313714 , 3572465 , 3572465", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303313714, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1441353578?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0332 History , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0332 History , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0332 History , 0601 International Relations , 0700 Social structure"," History , International Relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , China , Collective representation , Framing , Ili movement , International relations , Macro-mobilization , Meso-mobilizations , Political opportunity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+1944+Ili+movement%3A+Political+opportunity%2C+framing+process+and+international+relations+in+revolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zulifeikeer%2C+Balati&amp;isbn=9781303313714&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"621,"""Workin' It"": Trans* Lives in the Age of Epidemic","Situated in the interstices of anthropology, public health, and critical theory, this dissertation pursues questions of gender, health, transnationality, and governance. It does so through a critical medical anthropological study of trans* lives during what has been referred to as ""the second wave of AIDS"" in San Francisco. According to public health research and epidemiological studies, urban transgender women are reported to constitute one of most vulnerable populations for HIV infection in the United States. Combining research methods of medical anthropology and urban ethnography, this dissertation explores self-making and world-making practices of trans* individuals during a time, I call ""the age of epidemic."" Multi-year ethnographic research was based primarily in San Francisco's Tenderloin, a low-income, culturally diverse neighborhood that has been referred to as the ""epi-center of the AIDS epidemic"" in San Francisco. At the same time, it is home and center of social life for many trans* immigrants from Mexico, Central and South American, and South-east Asia, who migrate to the city in hopes of creating vibrant lives. Hence, the term, trans* is meant to reference three intersecting experiences: transgender identity; transnational conditions of migration; and the crossing of multiple political, geographical, linguistic, sex/gender, and bodily borders. As well, trans* refers to the Tenderloin itself as a translocal space networked by global processes of migration, diaspora, and economic restructuring. Ethnographic research was conducted with transgender and immigrant interlocutors, neighborhood denizens, public health researchers and healthcare providers, and local and international transgender activists. Clinic-based participant-observations and volunteer activities were conducted at a public health center, which provides care to homeless and underserved populations. In late 1994, it opened the first transgender primary healthcare clinic in the United States. This dissertation documents how trans* women create lives through ""workin it,"" a constellation of dynamic and heterogeneous tactics including: actions for making forms of sociality and publics in San Francisco's rapidly transforming Tenderloin; practices for creating kinship and engaging in reciprocal practices of care outside normalizing regimes of sex, gender, and laws of alliance and descent; activities for cultivating trans* bodies and becomings utilizing biomedical technologies often in unexpected ways; and conducts for fashioning a beautiful and ethical life when such a life is often deemed diseased, foreign, and other. Findings have lead to the conclusion that epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS, have a paradoxical force in contemporary life. Epidemics are destructive, pathological biosocial events, causing untold sickness, suffering and death. But they are also generative. Epidemics instantiate proliferative governing strategies and technologies, which discipline and manage bodies under logics of health promotion. At the same time, the immeasurable sickness, death, and loss caused by HIV/AIDS has provided evidence to support political claims for health and life by trans* communities. The calamitous impacts have offered a language through which to render visible social inequalities and social suffering. The biosocial crisis has engendered new social movements for justice and affirmations of trans* survivals.

It finds that a small circle of rooted cosmopolitans—a term used by Sidney Tarrow to describe ""outsiders inside/insiders outside""—was responsible for the emergence of a movement during the mid-1970s that was centered in New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. The activists profiled here were not the powerful, but neither were they the powerless. They tended to be highly-educated professionals who were drawn into activism after their moral sensibilities had been greatly offended. The emotional connections that formed between activists and victims thus arose within the historical context of intensifying market relations in this contemporary era of globalization. But why the spectacle of distant suffering drove some people to devote themselves to advancing the cause of human rights can be answered only in deeply personal terms. Biography is crucial to understanding how this transformation occurred for them: religious beliefs, a long-held cultural interest, a friend who experienced political repression and symbolized the plight of an entire country, previous work on domestic civil liberties, or their own victimization. Their worldview was based on a far-reaching conception of one's ethical responsibilities. As Kwame Anthony Appiah has argued, lives are given value by the identities that shape them—the philosophical basis of a cosmopolitanism that is premised upon ""kindness to strangers."" Activists proceeded in a similar path from an abstract notion of the rights-bearing individual to immersing themselves in the lived experiences of prisoners, dissidents, and other persecuted individuals they may have never actually met in person. Lacking the authority of state actors, activists had to act as moral entrepreneurs. Their social value was providing elites with information. The researchers who gathered the material for the reports published by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch became experts who were called to testify before Congress. Journalists quoted their findings to counter or corroborate the official version of events. NGOs also developed legal expertise that they used to expand the reach of international human rights law. As this subfield became more widely taught at law schools, some of which established programs dedicated to it, a generation of lawyer-activists took the international human rights movement in a new, more litigious direction. Publicity was just as important. It was easier to mobilize public opinion against repressive governments if the victims were well known; even better if activists became part of the story. By reaffirming their accuracy and objectivity, activists could gain the trust of reliable donors, philanthropic foundations, wealthy benefactors, and celebrities, all of whom became important sources of income that enabled their NGOs to expand during the last three decades of the twentieth century.",1441714392,,Dissertations & Theses," Ramirez, Zachary StevenRamirezStevenZacharyRamirez, Zachary Steven",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3098047561 , 82267062 , 66569 , 9781303374418 , 3593953 , 3593953", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303374418, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1441714392?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations",," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," American history , Modern history , International Relations"," Social sciences , Activism , Amnesty International USA , Cold War , Human Rights Watch , Human rights , International League for the Rights of Man",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=International+Human+Rights+Activism+in+the+United+States+during+the+Cold+War&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ramirez%2C+Zachary+Steven&amp;isbn=9781303374418&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"623,"In pursuit of the American degree: Internationalization, national security, and the making of South Asian foreign students","My dissertation examines how global neoliberal forces intersect with racialized state security practices to shape the transnational subjectivities of South Asian overseas students studying in the U.S. in the post-9/11 moment. These students' movement across national borders to pursue higher education in the United States positions them as ideal neoliberal subjects, while the post-9/11 national security state renders them racially as potential risks to security. In this way, I argue that universities and their overseas student populations are confronting a tension that is central to current geopolitics, namely the contradiction between engaging globalizing processes and protecting national borders in the context of the so-called ""war on terror."" Drawing from 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a public university in New York carried out between 2011 and 2012, my work explores how this tension unfolds in the lives of middle class students migrating from South Asia to study in the U.S. I consider how the ambivalence marking their trajectories informs the values, responsibilities, and decisions of this significant transnational population, as well as of the institution hosting them. Though the global migration of university students has grown substantially in recent decades, and is an important form of skilled migration, it has not been sufficiently studied with the social sciences. It is particularly striking that this population has not figured centrally within the anthropological research on transnationality. Addressing this gap, my research offers an ethnographic perspective that examines the racial and class dimensions of the transnational practices of belonging among South Asian overseas students. By situating the experiences of these students in the specific historical, social, and political economic conditions that structure their transnational trajectories, my work challenges narratives that frame these students as part of a homogenous global elite. I point to ""educational debts,"" the forms of debts that are attached to their pursuit of education in the U.S., as a key regulatory regime shaping the cultural logics of South Asian overseas students as transnational subjects.",1443536321,,Dissertations & Theses," Thomas, SusanThomasSusanThomas, Susan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3104576771 , 81968912 , 66569 , 9781303396885 , 3594865 , 3594865", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303396885, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1443536321?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education"," Educational sociology , Ethnic studies , South Asian Studies , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Migration , National security , Neoliberalism , New York , Overseas students , Race and security state , South Asian diaspora , Transnational studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+pursuit+of+the+American+degree%3A+Internationalization%2C+national+security%2C+and+the+making+of+South+Asian+foreign+students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thomas%2C+Susan&amp;isbn=9781303396885&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"624,Explaining global-unevenness of environmental degradations: Monopoly economy and spatial injustice,"This dissertation presents an ecological critique of capitalism. The aim is to develop a theoretical frame that can explain globally-uneven degradations as opposed to global risks. I conceptualize the global-unevenness of environmental degradations as a problem of spatial injustice, and argue that this spatial injustice is systemically produced under the current capitalist economy, which is a global monopoly economy. In order to theorize injustice distributed along the logic of spatial hierarchy, power relations between different actors should be specified. Taking large corporations as a primary analytical unit, this dissertation theorizes the current economy in terms of monopoly power. I argue that, in an economy characterized by a high level of concentration, the market division-of-labor does not necessarily represent decentralized/uncontrolled coordination as portrayed in mainstream economics. Instead, the market is instrumentally organized by monopoly power, and the resultant market configuration is highly controlled and hierarchical, at least highly enough to avoid being regarded as subject to competitive conditions. In particular, focusing on the firm-to-firm market, I explore how large corporations actively shape their relationship with other firms in their upstream- and downstream- industries. Analysis of monopoly power reveals that, in an economy with vastly asymmetric power relations, the economic activities of large corporations that produce market-captured positive values also produce and distribute uncaptured negative values. This process of cost externalization is, I argue, the central mechanism forcing uneven distribution of environmental hazards. This dissertation, then, applies the monopoly approach to a globalized economy under neoliberalism. I argue that neoliberalism has little to do with the expansion of the competitive market principle and much to do with the global division-of-labor driven by large transnational corporations (TNCs). Based on this analysis of the global monopoly economy, I explore the social and environmental consequences that result from the cost externalization performed by TNCs through globally hierarchical production networks. If large TNCs are the power units significantly responsible for the grave degradations observed in many parts of the world, the legal immunity that TNCs are enjoying for the problems they induce requires a separate explanation. Transnational injustice is difficult to deal with especially because political systems are nationally organized while the problem at hand has a transnational quality. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) of the US provided a small opportunity to overcome the limitation of nationally-organized legal systems by allowing foreign (non-US) nationals to file their suits in the US courts. However, the ATS raised challenges to the Westphalian notion of sovereignty, and the small opening for TNC-liability provided by the ATS has shut over the last three-decade period, as those challenges were settled in such a way to reaffirm Westphalian sovereignty. By analyzing court decisions on selected ATS cases against TNCs, and with specific focus on the rationales for TNC-immunity under international law, I point out that the concept of nominal statehood based on the Westphalian ideal produces real effects that pose serious obstacles in efforts to address transnational injustice. Based on the analysis of monopoly power and its negative consequences, this dissertation also provides a critique of depoliticization trends shown in contemporary economic- and social- theories. First, I argue that mainstream economic theories adhere to the competitiveness assumption by treating corporations, regardless of their sizes, as individuals, without capturing the fact that a market dominated by large corporations operates through qualitatively different dynamics from competitive market dynamics. Economically-induced spatial injustice has thus become an irrelevant topic in mainstream economics, as the power issue, which should be a major implication drawn from the consideration of firm size, has become analytically negated. Second, this dissertation also points out how contemporary social theories, too, have lost their critical quality. I argue that social theories, both mainstream and leftist alike, came to negate the concepts of structural unevenness and antagonism in their theorization of critical consciousness and agency when they departed from the Marxist tradition of analyzing class structure. This trend is closely related to the fact that recent social theories take the rise of so-called ""new social movement"" agendas in advanced countries as their primary empirical base. Given that the problem at hand is transnational injustice, i.e. injustice that is hierarchically distributed in a globally-uneven fashion, I argue, over-generalization of the advanced world's experiences runs the risk of under-theorizing the critical consciousness that does and should develop from the unevenness itself, that is, from the experiences of the more oppressed people.",1446999248,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, SeungjinKimSeungjinKim, Seungjin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3112767581 , 82640682 , 66569 , 9781303423000 , 3595925 , 3595925", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303423000, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1446999248?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Social research , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Environmental degradation , Externality , Large corporations , Monopoly economy , Neoliberalism , Spatial injustice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Explaining+global-unevenness+of+environmental+degradations%3A+Monopoly+economy+and+spatial+injustice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Seungjin&amp;isbn=9781303423000&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"625,Know Thyselves: Theorizing Multiple Personality through Social Movements,"Contemporary scholarship in medical anthropology reveals the hegemony of the biomedical model of illness in the United States (Baer, Singer, and Susser 2003; Martin 1987). Health and normalcy are defined by medical institutions in their characterizations of disorder in medical texts and therapeutic protocols, and are affected by non-medical, public and private institutions such as those related to the mass media, religious organizations, social movements, and therapy. There are ongoing controversies surrounding the medical legitimacy of some illnesses, including Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), a U.S. ""culture bound syndrome"" that includes therapies and theories of causation outside the biomedical model. In the late 19 th century, one of the most unusual ""abnormal types"" shares a similar symptom set with what the American Psychiatric Association (APA) now defines as DID (Ofshe and Watters 1996:4). Through participant-observation, interviews, and archival research, I explore the discourses and events surrounding the identification of DID/MPD since the 1950s. Using two case studies, I compare how the individuals, institutions, and discourses involved in these cases respond to broader changes in health care, political economy, and sociocultural processes in the U.S. This study is guided by three goals: First, to examine how the various key informants and institutions involved in the longstanding controversies surrounding the diagnosis of DID/MPD in the U.S. characterize this phenomenon, with regard to international standards of mental health; second, to analyze the role of social movements in the meaning and stigma attached to DID/MPD in the U.S., specifically, as a disorder that disproportionately effects women; and third, to study the significance of hypnotic, psychoanalytic, writing and ""talk therapies"" in the treatment of DID/MPD and in their relation to claims of scientific/medical legitimacy. This research contributes to scholarship in anthropology and the social history of medicine by demonstrating how medical diagnostic categories such as DID act as dynamic conceptual spaces for social movements. Deconstructing the cultural processes shaping the characterization of DID, I show how women's embodied and disembodied ""voices"" speak through the DSM to support ulterior social causes, lifestyles, and political systems that contribute to their stigmatization.",1448559204,,Dissertations & Theses," Taylor, Jennifer MichelleTaylorMichelleJenniferTaylor, Jennifer Michelle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3117991631 , 78993082 , 66569 , 9781303427244 , 3596275 , 3596275", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303427244, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448559204?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0497 Medical Ethics , 0622 Clinical psychology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0497 Medical Ethics , 0622 Clinical psychology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0497 Medical Ethics , 0622 Clinical psychology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0497 Medical Ethics , 0622 Clinical psychology"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Medical Ethics , Clinical psychology"," Social sciences , Psychology , Health and environmental sciences , Dissociative identity disorder , Medical ethics , Multiple personality disorder , Social movements , Women's health , Writing therapy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Know+Thyselves%3A+Theorizing+Multiple+Personality+through+Social+Movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Taylor%2C+Jennifer+Michelle&amp;isbn=9781303427244&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"626,When states 'come out': The politics of visibility and the diffusion of sexual minority rights in Europe,"This dissertation explains how the politics of visibility affect relations among states and the political power of marginalized people within them. I show that the key to understanding processes of social change lies in a closer examination of the ways in which—and the degree to which—marginalized groups make governments and societies see and interact with their ideas. Specifically, I explore the politics of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) visibility. For a group that many observers have referred to as “an invisible minority,” the newfound presence and influence of LGBT people in many different nation states offers fresh opportunities for the study of socio-political change and the diffusion of norms. Despite similar international pressures, why are the trajectories of socio-legal recognition for marginalized groups so different across states? This question is not answered by conventional explanations of diffusion and social change focusing on differences in international pressures, the fit between domestic and international norms, modernization, or low implementation costs. Instead, specific transnational and international channels and domestic interest groups can make visible political issues that were hidden, and it is that visibility that creates the political resonance of international norms in domestic politics, and can lead to their gradual internalization. A state’s openness to international organizations and information flows has demonstrable effects on norm diffusion. It affects the ability of new ideas to enter domestic discourse. Furthermore, the degree to which domestic actors are embedded in transnational advocacy networks illuminates the issue and shapes the speed and direction of diffusion. Visibility has engendered the interactions between movements and states that empower people—mobilizing actors to demand change, influencing the spread of new legal standards, and weaving new ideas into the fabrics of societies. It is this process of “coming out” that leads to the socio-political recognition of rights that alters the situation for such groups. Ultimately, the politics of visibility is located at the intersection of international relations and social movement politics.",1448867388,,Dissertations & Theses," Ayoub, Phillip MansourAyoubMansourPhillipAyoub, Phillip Mansour",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3119188841 , 76383562 , 66569 , 9781303517259 , 3574724 , 3574724", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303517259, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448867388?accountid=14496," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," GLBT Studies , International Relations , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Activism , European Integration , Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights , Norm diffusion , Sexual minority , Social movements , Transnational relations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+states+%27come+out%27%3A+The+politics+of+visibility+and+the+diffusion+of+sexual+minority+rights+in+Europe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ayoub%2C+Phillip+Mansour&amp;isbn=9781303517259&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"627,"Peripheral urbanization and urban politics in the Istanbul city-region: The case of Gebze, 1965–2012","This study is about peripheral urbanization and urban politics in the Istanbul city-region. Using a multi-disciplinary methodological approach, including archival research, participant observation, and in-depth interviews, this dissertation examines the relationship between the organization of urban space and urban social movements within the context of Turkey's integration into world-markets after World War II. The study focuses on one of the satellite cities of Istanbul named Gebze, located just southeast of Istanbul on the Sea of Marmara. Gebze turned into a gigantic satellite city with a million people after the drastic inflow of industry from inner-city Istanbul, a substantial increase in migrant labor from all over Turkey, and ever-growing social and environmental problems since the 1960s. The study argues that the predominant emphasis of centrality in the studies of global cities and city-regions puts the socio-spatial and political transformations in the peripheries at the background. However, global city formation as a centralized process relies on the accelerated suburbanization of the global city region. Therefore, this study looks at Istanbul's peripheries and highlights Gebze as its gigantic industrialized neighbor that has emerged and grown under Istanbul's development. Despite being labeled as merely the ""backwater"" of Istanbul, this satellite city has always been a hotbed of social and political contestations, ranging from unionized labor movement in the 1970s to the recent protests against top-down urban regeneration projects. This study demonstrates the changing forms of social movements in Gebze through focusing on three emblematic cases. As an industrial city of the national development era, Gebze became the hotbed of the unionized labor movement, and the emblematic collective action of the Great Resistance of the 15-16 June 1970. At the juncture of the neoliberalization and the end of developmentalism, and within the context of austerity programs, diminished public employment and revoked state benefits, Gebze witnessed the occupation of its downtown by 700 laid-off municipal workers in 1994. The emblematic political mobilization of the neoliberal era in Gebze is community mobilization (2009) against the urban transformation project (UTP) in a squatter neighborhood located on the outskirts of Istanbul and Gebze.",1449400624,,Dissertations & Theses," Gundogan, Azat ZanaGundoganZanaAzatGundogan, Azat Zana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3121593201 , 81708752 , 66569 , 9781303444807 , 3597020 , 3597020", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303444807, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1449400624?accountid=14496," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Middle Eastern Studies , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , City region , Gebze , Istanbul , Peripheral urbanization , Turkey , Urban social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Peripheral+urbanization+and+urban+politics+in+the+Istanbul+city-region%3A+The+case+of+Gebze%2C+1965%E2%80%932012&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gundogan%2C+Azat+Zana&amp;isbn=9781303444807&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"628,"Invisible politics: Dorothy Kenyon and women's internationalism, 1930–1950","This dissertation studies New York lawyer and women's rights advocate Dorothy Kenyon and her role in an international women's movement between the 1930s and 1950 whose goal was to identify and eliminate legal discriminations against women. Kenyon was appointed to represent the United States on two international commissions that studied the status of women where she actively enlisted the assistance of international women's organizations such as the International Alliance of Women (IAW), International Federation of Business and Professional Women (IFBPW), and the World Young Women's Christian Association (WYWCA) and others. Assistance was also provided by the U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau, which puts her in the thick of the debate over protective legislation for women and the National Woman's Party's attempts to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). In the League of Nations Kenyon and her colleagues created a questionnaire designed to evaluate national laws that differentiated men and women until the League became defunct. In the United Nations, Kenyon continued her work during the beginning of the Cold War, from 1947 to 1950, on the Commission on the Status of Women to instill international standard-setting for women by writing conventions (treaties) and encouraging active participation of women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to help gain political, social, cultural and educational rights to raise the standard of living for women all over the world. The commission held its third session in Beirut, Lebanon in 1949 to encourage involvement with non-western women. The work that Kenyon and the commission achieved during these years forms the foundation of subsequent international agreements that sought to eliminate discriminations against women.",1449405440,,Dissertations & Theses," Linskey, Carol SusanLinskeySusanCarolLinskey, Carol Susan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3121596961 , 81708732 , 66569 , 9781303445040 , 3597037 , 3597037", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303445040, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1449405440?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," Biographies , Womens studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Cold War , Commission on the Status of Women , Gender , Internationalism , Kenyon, Dorothy , United Nations , Women , Women's organizations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Invisible+politics%3A+Dorothy+Kenyon+and+women%27s+internationalism%2C+1930%E2%80%931950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Linskey%2C+Carol+Susan&amp;isbn=9781303445040&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"629,"Transnational Circulations of ""Laban"" Methods: Gender, Power Relations, and Negotiated Meanings in Early Twenty-First Century South Korea's Modernity","This dissertation investigates western-developed “Laban” methods that middle-class Korean female Laban specialists transported to South Korea and, there, tactically adapted to South Korean contexts during the 1990s and the early twenty-first century. It particularly focuses on how these Korean women’s repurposings of “Laban” methods intersect with conditions of global capitalism and specific South Korean cultural politics, job markets, and dance instruction and employment networks. I claim that the specialists gained professional power by acquiring western-issued professional “Laban” credentials, which positioned them to create an alternative space for employment within already competitive and feminized dance markets. They founded the Korea Laban Movement Institute at home and have expanded their “Laban”-based creative movement education to the public with the support of a number of state and city grants. Their successful expansion of public dance/movement education has capitalized on opportunities afforded by the Korean state’s cultural policy since the early 2000s, which has included the promotion of public arts and culture education, including dance, to foster “cultural democracy.” At the same time, their approach to devising student-centered, experimental, and creative movement classes for laypeople that incorporate “Laban” methods has challenged longstanding models in South Korea for fashioning dance careers oriented to professional performance and dance education that focuses on technical training. I argue that these women’s recasting of “Laban” methods results not from colonial force, but from the choices they have made as South Korea’s modernity emerges within the frame of global economy. And, their embrace and adaptation of “Western” bodily knowledge and emphasis on cultivating individualism in and through Korean bodies have countered Confucian-based hierarchical authoritarianism and social collectivism. Taking a global perspective, this dissertation draws on interviews, observation data, and archival materials to explore the connections among multiple factors: culture and political-economy, global capital and nation-states, and physical practices and gendered labor markets. It also emphasizes the transformation of practices when they are transported transnationally. My case study shows Korean transmigrators negotiated new meanings, forms, and values of this deterritorialized western practice for their own purposes, and they did not simply reproduce western values.",1465059910,,Dissertations & Theses," Hwang, Hye-WonHwangHye-WonHwang, Hye-Won",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3146712521 , 78999832 , 66569 , 9781303507052 , 3600572 , 3600572", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303507052, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1465059910?accountid=14496," 0378 Dance , 0453 Womens studies , 0457 Performing Arts , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies"," 0378 Dance , 0453 Womens studies , 0457 Performing Arts , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies"," 0378 Dance , 0453 Womens studies , 0457 Performing Arts , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies",," 0378 Dance , 0453 Womens studies , 0457 Performing Arts , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies"," Dance , Womens studies , Performing Arts , Pacific Rim Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Education , Creative movement education , Deterritorialized knowledge , Laban methods , Modernity , Power and tactics , South Korea , Transmigrating women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+Circulations+of+%22Laban%22+Methods%3A+Gender%2C+Power+Relations%2C+and+Negotiated+Meanings+in+Early+Twenty-First+Century+South+Korea%27s+Modernity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hwang%2C+Hye-Won&amp;isbn=9781303507052&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"630,Public Culture and Cultural Citizenship at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival,"This dissertation explores the relationship between state, citizen and public culture through an ethnographic and historical examination of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival in northern Greece. In the two-year period leading up to and following its fiftieth anniversary in 2009, the festival was caught up in the larger economic, political and social crises that have overtaken Greece in the last five years - a painful period of rapid transformation and neoliberalization for one of Europe's staunchest social-welfare states. As the Greek state faces bankruptcy - both economic and political - it is being forced to revisit the terms of its social contract with its citizens. In a country where ""culture"" was once touted as a national ""heavy industry,"" the relationship between the state and cultural production is also being restructured. Public culture is one of the areas of social life in which people are now struggling with these changes and attempting to redefine what it means to be a citizen of the Greek state - utilizing and revising local, national and transnational identities in the process. In this larger context, I consider how the Thessaloniki Film Festival functions as an institution of public culture. Specifically, this dissertation investigates how different film publics come together within the space of the festival and how, on the occasion of the institution's fiftieth anniversary, different social histories of cinema were being constructed in response to the present crises. I also take an in-depth look at a Greek filmmakers' movement that boycotted the festival's fiftieth-anniversary edition as a way of protesting the state and demanding a new national film policy. Through these investigations, I analyze how different forms of publicness, collectivity and citizenship are negotiated and enacted, both by the institution and by members of its publics and counterpublics. I argue that practices of cultural citizenship - forms of citizenship that arise where fields of cultural production meet the practices and discourses of the state - can constitute important forms of resistance, attempts at recuperating a critical public sphere and reclaiming a citizenship based on the experience of a critical collectivity.",1465065338,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Toby KimLeeKimTobyLee, Toby Kim",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3146738251 , 76044912 , 66569 , 9781303502521 , 3600198 , 3600198", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303502521, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1465065338?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Cultural anthropology , European Studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Crisis , Cultural citizenship , Cultural institutions , Film festivals , Greece , Publics & counterpublics , Thessaloniki International Film Festival",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+Culture+and+Cultural+Citizenship+at+the+Thessaloniki+International+Film+Festival&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Toby+Kim&amp;isbn=9781303502521&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"631,Sustaining feminist film cultures: An institutional history of &lt;i&gt;Women Make Movies&lt;/i&gt;,"This dissertation presents an institutional history of the feminist film and media organization Women Make Movies (WMM) from its founding as a collective in the 1970s through the present and is the first comprehensive examination of the history of the organization itself. Drawing on the archival history of WMM—materials ranging from old newsletters, scrap paper, and correspondence to tax returns and board meeting minutes—this dissertation illuminates the past and present of this influential institution in broader social contexts, narratives of cultural history, and sets of political tensions. Critically situating WMM’s history reveals how the organization’s transformations over time are imbricated in a number of larger historical tendencies. More specifically, these tendencies include evolving concerns about the role of visual media in education and feminist and social movements; fluctuating political and economic climates and their impact on independent media and non-profit arts organizations; changing media technologies and their effects on production and distribution; shifting interests, successes, and difficulties of social movements; and transforming conditions around the contemporary production of images, their circulation, and effects in a globalized media space. Moreover, this project argues that WMM was important for the growth of Film and Women’s Studies as academic disciplines and remains a significant force in shaping how we think about the past, present, and future of feminist moving image culture. Thus, this project enables productive lenses for a number of intellectual projects, including interdisciplinary discourses around women, gender, sexuality, and identity; economies and histories of the arts; studies of transnational media production and reception; and the relation between cultural history and institutions that create, distribute, or preserve media. This project historicizes and culturally situates WMM to better understand its place in histories of independent film and feminism, its extensive influence in education and media culture, and its role in shaping trajectories of global feminist media practices.",1466304810,,Dissertations & Theses," Fallica, Kristen M.FallicaM.KristenFallica, Kristen M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3151350891 , 83709502 , 66569 , 9781303593055 , 3577178 , 3577178", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303593055, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466304810?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Film studies"," Womens studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Arts organizations , Feminism , Independent films , Nonprofit organizations , Women Make Movies , Women's filmmaking",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustaining+feminist+film+cultures%3A+An+institutional+history+of+Women+Make+Movies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fallica%2C+Kristen+M.&amp;isbn=9781303593055&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"632,"The CLAEM and the construction of elite art worlds: Philanthropy, Latinamericanism, and avant-garde music","In this dissertation I argue that the Centro Latinoamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales (CLAEM, 1962-1971) accurately exemplifies how the embrace of avant-garde art music by several young Latin American composers is crucial to understand the creation and consolidation of particular social groups often identified as elites. This dissertation is a concrete case study of how elites in a formation phase consolidate their status and achieve distinction by looking at the stories composers and patrons tell about themselves, their relation to the musical avant-garde, and discourses of Latin Americanism. By following, consuming, and rearticulating international musical models, the members of this art world—as patrons, composers, critics and listeners—engaged in a hegemonic process that resulted in their legitimization of new elites and the institutionalization of the avant-garde in Argentina. There are three key questions that I want to answer with this dissertation. First, how was the avant-garde articulated in Latin America, and in which ways did it respond or not to theories of avant-garde movements and modernity in the rest of the world? Second, how were composers during the 1960s engaging with discourses of Latin Americanism as professional strategy, identification marker and musical style? Third, what is the role of art in the legitimation and construction of elite status and identity? The case study of the CLAEM provides insight into three different aspects of music making, elite art worlds, and the embrace of the avant-garde in Argentina and Latin America during the second half of the twentieth century. These aspects become my main themes throughout the dissertation. The first theme involves the unique way in which composers at the CLAEM followed, consumed, and rearticulated international models of the avant-garde that were then embodied, resignified and institutionalized. The second theme explores how the CLAEM was a formative social experience, where transnational connections between actors who are part of the same cultural formation—both from Latin America as well as Europe and the United States—created important networks of solidarity, communication and intellectual exchange and resulted in the adoption of Latin Americanism as a professional strategy and musical style. Finally, this work explores the consolidation of elite groups and the creation of elite art worlds as the result of philanthropic efforts led by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Di Tella family.",1466659754,,Dissertations & Theses," Herrera, Luis EduardoHerreraEduardoLuisHerrera, Luis Eduardo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3152744101 , 83765932 , 66569 , 9781303579455 , 3603379 , 3603379", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303579455, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466659754?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Music , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , 20th century music , Elite social groups , Ethnomusicology , Ginastera, Alberto , Latin American music",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+CLAEM+and+the+construction+of+elite+art+worlds%3A++Philanthropy%2C+Latinamericanism%2C+and+avant-garde+music&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Herrera%2C+Luis+Eduardo&amp;isbn=9781303579455&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"633,Religious environmental groups and global climate change politics in the United States and the United Kingdom: What motivates activism?,"This study sought to explore the motivation of religious environmental groups (REG) to engage in climate change activism in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Scholars across the humanities and social sciences have attempted to describe this phenomenon in recent years, and the term “Global South” has become widely accepted. Beyond the Color Curtain: Empire and Resistance from the Tricontinental to the Global South argues for grounding this concept of global subaltern resistance in the legacy of the 1966 Tricontinental in which delegates from the liberation movements of eighty-two nations came together in Havana, Cuba to form an alliance against imperialism. This alliance, called the Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America (OSPAAAL) quickly became the driving force of international political radicalism and the primary engine of its cultural production. Through an analysis of its journals, newsreels and posters, this study examines how the OSPAAAL, especially through a sustained engagement with the African American Civil Rights Movement, presents a deterritorialized vision of imperial power and an argument for an equally global revolutionary subjectivity. This new Tricontinental subjectivity is articulated through a political signifier of color that is unlocked from a racially deterministic signified, meaning color refers not to physical appearance but to a shared ideology of anti-imperialism, which serves to destabilize racially essentialist or trait-based claims to belonging. Because the Tricontinental represents the extension into the Americas of the anti-imperialist union of Afro-Asian nations begun at the 1955 Bandung Conference, it points to a moment in which a diverse range of radicalist writers and artists in the Americas began interacting with its discourse. By tracing the circulation of the Tricontinental’s ideology in its cultural production and in related texts from Third Cinema, Cuban Revolutionary film, the Nuyorican Movement, and writings by Young Lords and Black Power activists, Beyond the Color Curtain outlines how tricontinentalists laid the groundwork for a theory of power and resistance that is resurfacing in the contemporary notion of the Global South.",1467753214,,Dissertations & Theses," Mahler, Anne GarlandMahlerGarlandAnneMahler, Anne Garland",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3155494051 , 83880202 , 66569 , 9781303588464 , 3603901 , 3603901", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303588464, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1467753214?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0325 Black studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0325 Black studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0325 Black studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0325 Black studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," Latin American literature , Black studies , Latin American history , Caribbean Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , African American and Cuban solidarity , Black radicalism , Cuban newsreel , Global South , Nuyorican movement , Postcolonial theory , Third cinema , Tricontinental",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+the+color+curtain%3A+Empire+and+Resistance+from+the+Tricontinental+to+the+Global+South&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mahler%2C+Anne+Garland&amp;isbn=9781303588464&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"635,Laboring for Global Perfection: The International Dimension of Mid-Nineteenth-Century Fourierism,"This dissertation examines the United States-based communitarian socialists known as the Fourierists as a piece of the larger international Fourierist movement, highlighting the numerous points of contact between Fourierists and their counterparts on each side of the Atlantic. My goal is to understand Fourierism as a multinational movement that sparked an international conversation among its members, which made it one of the most cosmopolitan of the reform movements to emerge from the social tumult in the 1840s. Its Janus-faced focus on the U.S. reform landscape and fixed connection with European Fourierists made Fourierism arguably the most dynamic reform movement of the nineteenth century. It is a story of connectivity among individuals who believed they possessed a new moral framework for remaking the world. The theories of the French social philosopher Charles Fourier also helped change the course of antebellum reform in the United States by introducing important themes and an entirely new vocabulary to the reform lexicon. The strength of the Fourierist press in the United States, especially the celebrated journal The Harbinger , highlights the movement’s fingerprint on the course of American journalism. I will explore how and why this movement spread so far from the 1830s-1850s, and how these activists transcended national identity in order to realize the plan of perfecting the world’s ills through the adoption of Fourier’s experimental living arrangements. As a movement based on experiment, exchange, and collaboration, Fourierism intermingled freely with other mid-century reform movements including abolition, women’s rights, free love, as well as workingmen’s and other socialist movements. Traveling Fourierist leaders, the growth of Fourierist journalism, and the community of early Fourierists in New York City fostered complex identities in those at the heart of the movement. Their involvement in multiple causes demonstrates the international roots of mid-nineteenth-century reform. While adherents in each nation adapted Fourier’s message to their own specific national context, the fluidity of the larger philosophy transcended borders, helping create an international reform identity in an age usually best known for a parochial nationalism. Using archival sources and published journals and periodicals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this dissertation follows a chronological analysis of the movement’s international layers. I examine the period from the movement’s inception in the 1830s to its height in 1846, focusing on Fourierism’s importation to the United States and its evolution from a cosmopolitan group of European and Francophone expatriates in New York City to a more Americanized version championed by Horace Greeley and Albert Brisbane with intentional appeal to workingmen. I also focus on the decline of Fourierism in the late 1840s, the pivotal year of the French Revolution of 1848, and the growth of the Free Love movement from Fourierism’s ashes in the early 1850s. This dissertation compels scholars to look closer at the Fourierist movement as a case study in successfully changing the vocabulary of social reformers, bringing attention to the problems inherent within industrial capitalism, offering an inclusive approach to labor reform which included women’s rights, and an alternative to the bourgeois home. Fourierism was at the center of a dialogue on gender norms and sexuality that would ultimately include members of the organized women’s rights movement and advocates of the controversial free love movement. The Fourierist movement’s communal ethos promised to improve the lives of women by ameliorating the drudgery of housework and providing shared child-rearing opportunities. Additionally, Charles Fourier’s highly controversial theories on sexual liberation and marriage reform led some Fourierists to challenge reigning sexual mores. Studying the works of the Fourierists reveal new insights into the attitudes about gender and sexuality within the larger world of mid-nineteenth-century reform in the United States and Europe. Fourierism inspired a debate about gender, marriage, and religion that changed the language and tactics of mid-nineteenth-century reform.",1468440322,,Dissertations & Theses," Bowman, Megan PerleBowmanPerleMeganBowman, Megan Perle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3157590221 , 83965202 , 66569 , 9781303537738 , 3602006 , 3602006", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303537738, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468440322?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," American history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Communitarian socialists , Fourierism , Multinational movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Laboring+for+Global+Perfection%3A+The+International+Dimension+of+Mid-Nineteenth-Century+Fourierism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bowman%2C+Megan+Perle&amp;isbn=9781303537738&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"636,The Long Downturn and its Discontents: Language Writing and the New Left,"This study argues that postwar poetry and politics share a common trajectory in the US by situating “language writing” as a literary wing of the New Left. Beginning with the thematic turn to language in the work of Jackson MacLow ( The Pronouns , 1964), Jack Spicer ( Language , 1965) and Clark Coolidge during the 1960s, I argue that the cultural politics of form elaborated as “language writing” echoes emergent notions of social antagonism and political agency outside the workplace. This entanglement is particularly apparent in the Poetry Wars of the 1970s and 80s. In tandem with what is oft referred to as the fragmentation of the Left, these debates pit the explicitly anti-capitalist “politics of the referent” associated with language writing against what some call the multicultural “identity poetics” associated with new social movements. Passing through the work of canonical “language writers” such as Barrett Watten and Lyn Hejinian, as well as liminal cases like Harryette Mullen and Bernadette Mayer, this study examines the historical torque whereby New Left forms of politics are transformed by – and as – the cultural politics of literary forms. In particular, I examine the tendency of these literary transformations of social struggles to echo signal New Left antinomies between social class, race and gender, as that categorical triumvirate of social identity is increasingly accounted in cultural and linguistic terms. To do so I read the above developments in US poetry and poetics against the economic machinations of the postwar boom and its collapse, during the 1970s, in a crisis of profitability announcing the onset of a long downturn in capital accumulation. In my argument, the rise of new social movements during the postwar boom bequeaths forms of political agency ill-suited to the social climate of the long downturn. Taken up by poets, those notions of political agency provide a basis for the work of art in a time of political stasis. In the process, different types of poetry come to be seen as performing different kinds of political labor. This division of political labors along the lines of different literary forms coupled with distinct social identities tends, I argue, to make the intensifying implication of forms of social identity and capital accumulation illegible in the neoliberal aftermath of the “long downturn.” That is to say, The Long Downturn and its Discontents: Language Writing and the New Left argues that the opposition between economic class and social identity familiar to us from New Left social movements reappears, in the guise of “language writing” and Poetry Wars, just in time to mask the global recomposition of social classes in accord with the law of value’s raced and gendered wage differentials and labor markets.",1468448701,,Dissertations & Theses," Kreiner, TimothyKreinerTimothyKreiner, Timothy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3157664631 , 82831902 , 66569 , 9781303539299 , 3602125 , 3602125", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303539299, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468448701?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science"," 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science"," 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science",," 0591 American literature , 0615 Political science"," American literature , Political science"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Language writing , Literature , Marxism , New Left , Poetry , Politics of form , Postwar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Long+Downturn+and+its+Discontents%3A+Language+Writing+and+the+New+Left&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kreiner%2C+Timothy&amp;isbn=9781303539299&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"637,"Communism, Nationalism, and Identity in a Polish-German Borderland, 1945-1950","This dissertation examines the role of expulsions and repatriations in forging a new political and social reality in post-World War II Polish-German borderlands. In particular, it focuses on the Polish communist regime’s Polonization campaign in Lower Silesia, a borderland transferred to Poland from Germany in 1945. Polish communists, armed with the consent of the international community, initiated sweeping ethnic rearrangements that culminated in the uprooting and reinvention of people and territory. Indeed, Polonization and the ethnic homogenization of traditionally multicultural borderlands occupied a central position in the prevailing communist discourse of postwar reconstruction. Moreover, my work sheds light on the social and political history of ethnic consolidation, population movements, and the transnational implications of redrawing borders and communities in post-1945 East Central Europe. It also addresses pivotal questions for the understanding of postwar Europe: How do displaced people forge new communities and start new lives after the wreckage of war and genocide? Which memories and traditions are the most appropriate for constructing a new society in unfamiliar lands? And how did Polish and Jewish migrants as well as the indigenous population negotiate their visions of new homes with political leaders and authorities? Throughout the dissertation, I illuminate the impact of displacement and ethnic cleansing on the creation of a new national order set against the backdrop of a social and political revolution in communist Poland. In the end, this study contributes to larger debates about ethnic cleansing and to the ongoing discussions about the role of Poles, Jews, Germans, and Soviets in the postwar construction of an ethnically homogenous Polish nation-state.",1468954491,,Dissertations & Theses," Kwiecien, Michael P.KwiecienP.MichaelKwiecien, Michael P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3159836941 , 84028022 , 66569 , 9781303596728 , 3604268 , 3604268", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303596728, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468954491?accountid=14496," 0437 East European Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0614 Slavic Studies"," 0437 East European Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0614 Slavic Studies"," 0437 East European Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0614 Slavic Studies",," 0437 East European Studies , 0440 European Studies , 0614 Slavic Studies"," East European Studies , European Studies , Slavic Studies"," Social sciences , Communism and nation-building. , Displacement , Ethnic cleansing , Forced migrations , Polish-german borderlands , Polish-german relations , Population movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communism%2C+Nationalism%2C+and+Identity+in+a+Polish-German+Borderland%2C+1945-1950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kwiecien%2C+Michael+P.&amp;isbn=9781303596728&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"638,"Transition network: Exploring intersections between culture, the climate crisis, and a digital network in a community - driven global social movement","The core aim of this research is to explore the communication processes of the Transition movement, a community-led global social movement as it adapted in a local context. The Transition movement facilitates community -led responses to the current global financial and climate crisis via the Transit ion Network, an online network that began in 2006, and is comprised of more than 2000 initiatives in 35 countries that have used the Transition model to start projects that use small scale solutions to achieve greater sustainability. This research uses qualitative ethnographic methods and a theoretical framework based on actor network theory to better understand how the movement's grand narratives of ""climate change"" and ""peak oil"" are communicated into local community-based stories, responses, and actions toward sustainability, and secondly, to analyze the multilayered communication processes that facilitate these actions toward sustainable social change. Transition projects address a wide range of issues, including reducing dependency on peak-oil, creating community based local economies, supporting sustainable food production and consumption, building efficient transportation, housing, and more diverse and inclusive education. The Transition model provides a participatory communication framework laid out in specific stages for communities to begin this process. The popularity of the model coincides with an increase in the interest in and use of the term ""sustainability"" by media, academics and policymakers around the world, and an increase in the global use of digital technology as a resource for information gathering and sharing. Thus this study situates itself at the intersections of a global environmental and economic crisis, the popularization of the term ""sustainability,"" and an increasingly digitized a nd networked global society in order to better understand how social change is contextualized and facilitated in a local community via a global network. From the findings, I argue that although the model's rapid growth can be attributed, in part, to an appealing narrative that reframes more traditional environmental movement discourse into solutions-based community focused actions, the movement would do well to develop more organized communication processes around connecting with and recognizing other people and groups who share similar values and goals, and around defining and creating the space for consistent and efficient leaders. This study also reveals that members of Transition Amherst had mixed feelings about the group's success and this was attributed to a wide range of interpretations of the model and the purpose it serves, particularly in towns where the ideology of Transition has already, to some extent, been adopted.",1468986530,,Dissertations & Theses," Polk, EmilyPolkEmilyPolk, Emily",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3159899571 , 76872802 , 66569 , 9781303573699 , 3603139 , 3603139", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303573699, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468986530?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0640 Sustainability"," 0459 Communication , 0640 Sustainability"," 0459 Communication , 0640 Sustainability",," 0459 Communication , 0640 Sustainability"," Communication , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Community , Digital media , Environmental communication , Resilience , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transition+network%3A+Exploring+intersections+between+culture%2C+the+climate+crisis%2C+and+a+digital+network+in+a+community+-+driven+global+social+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Polk%2C+Emily&amp;isbn=9781303573699&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"639,Food sovereignty as resistance: Mocase's defense of territory and indigenous campesino knowledge in argentina,"Over the past six years, the convergence of the food, climate, energy, and financial crises have contributed to a new direction of global land seizures, commonly known as land grabs. The large-scale forms of current land grabs set unprecedented records in terms of their pace and scale. Extrapolating from a broad analysis of the drivers, the actors, and the land use changes of the current ""land rush,"" the first half of the paper draws from current literature to provide a background of land grabbing in Latin America. Financial investors, agribusiness firms, foreign governments, and national elites are among the numerous actors that have exploited precarious land tenure conditions finding justification in the current global food-crisis-centric narrative. The second half of the paper further interrogates land grabs in Argentina, particularly examining soybean production in the province of Santiago del Estero. Through interviews with the agrarian social movement Movimiento Campesino de Santiago del Estero (MOCASE) in Argentina, the research aimed to understand how land grabs affect local communities and the strategies of resistance used by MOCASE. The resulting study found a discourse of resistance couched within the concept of food sovereignty. To engage farmers in the concept, the movement organized and mobilized communities to defend their territories and reclaim an indigenous collective identity. The movement works discursively and in action, by leveraging a counter-hegemonic discourse while simultaneously building an alternative agricultural model. The paper concludes with broader implications of food sovereignty on government policy and society.",1476439688,,Dissertations & Theses," Meisner, JasonMeisnerJasonMeisner, Jason",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3178078521 , 84548612 , 66569 , 9781303609152 , 1549231 , 1549231", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303609152, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1476439688?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Ethics , Agriculture , Latin American Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agroecology , Food sovereignty , Land grabs , Mocase , Modernization theory , Santiago del estero",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Food+sovereignty+as+resistance%3A+Mocase%27s+defense+of++territory+and+indigenous+campesino++knowledge+in+argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meisner%2C+Jason&amp;isbn=9781303609152&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"640,The shape of things to come: Reconceptualizing world history curriculum for a global era,"This critical and philosophical study explores the relationship between globalization, the evolution of structural education reform policy (i.e., the standards and accountability movement), and the purpose of secondary history/social studies education in American society. From A Nation at Risk to Obama’s A Blueprint for Reform , federal education policy has narrowed the vision of public education in the United States for the past 30 years. The purpose of this study is three-fold: 1. question the purpose of history/social studies education in light of the effects of globalization on American public education reform; 2. propose a new rationale for world history curriculum in secondary education; and 3. reconceptualize a curriculum that is responsive to students living in a 21st century global society. I conducted critical discourse analysis (CDA) on the five federal policies since 1983 to explore the evolution of structural education reform and its effects on public education. The findings highlighted a shift in policy that now focuses on the economic potential of the individual in the global economy rather than a traditional democratic, socio-political purpose in the development of society. CDA also was conducted on current history/social studies standards—three state frameworks (Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York) and the Common Core Standards—to understand the influence of policy on what and how history/social studies education is taught in the U.S. All four frameworks reflect the focus on standards-based education reform, but the state frameworks more so reflect the traditional purpose of education where the Common Core Standards reflect the narrowed focus on skill-based learning. Based on the research and discourse analysis conducted in this study, I developed an epistemological overview of a reconceptualized world history curriculum that argues for an interdisciplinary social studies course entitled “Comparative Global Studies.” The conceptual foundation is based on Pinar’s reconceptualization theory, M. Singh’s concept of responsive education, and the learning theory of critical constructivism, which supports a curriculum that critically engages students with the current state of our world in light of globalization and how they as individuals and part of a greater collective are situated within the 21st century global society.",1476898466,,Dissertations & Theses," Bates, Ryan S.BatesS.RyanBates, Ryan S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3179882001 , 84596452 , 66569 , 9781303627446 , 3577645 , 3577645", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303627446, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1476898466?accountid=14496," 0515 Education , 0534 Social studies education , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0515 Education , 0534 Social studies education , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0515 Education , 0534 Social studies education , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0515 Education , 0534 Social studies education , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0727 Curriculum development"," Education , Social studies education , Mechanical engineering , Curriculum development"," Applied sciences , Education , Critical discourse analysis , Critical inquiry , Globalization , History/social education , State standards , World history curriculum",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+shape+of+things+to+come%3A+Reconceptualizing+world+history+curriculum+for+a+global+era&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bates%2C+Ryan+S.&amp;isbn=9781303627446&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"641,Future in the present: Projective practices in a transnational migrant community,"Future consideration in the form of plans, hopes, projects and dreams is a constitutive feature of the life of Mexican migrants and their families. This study seeks to understand this engagement with the future of transnational actors—of those that move around and those who stay. The study explores the ways in which this future consideration plays out in people’s everyday transnational living and, accordingly, how people’s future-oriented thinking is factored in transnational dynamics. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with families from a mountain-town in Oaxaca, Mexico with recent migrant ties to central New Jersey, this study explores the interplay of future-related processes of thought with people’s practices and the contexts of their transnational movement. My analytical focus is on three interrelated elements: a) the socio-cultural processes that the imagining of the future results from, b) the form and process of consideration of future scenarios and, c) the forms of behaviors and experiences this future consideration creates. The analysis first addresses the ways in which the processes of future consideration in this town are responsive to transnational migratory dynamics. Second, drawing from research in the cognitive sciences, I elaborate on the subjective mental processes through which social actors create images of the future. I argue that future-scenario building is an outcome of reflexive processes that occur in conversation with context and biographical history, and in relation to people’s interactions with others. Third, I show the ways in which the puzzles of transnational everyday living pose challenges for social actors’ future scenario building, exploring the ways that transnational actors conceptualize the future are consequential for strategic action. By examining these issues, this study proposes innovations to current migration scholarship, making subjective processes a central analytical focus in migration research. My findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional engagements with the future of transnational actors and the ways in which the modalities of this engagement take place produce subjectivity and action in their present. At the level of general social theory, this study addresses the projective capacity of human action and its relation to social and relational context.",1477559197,,Dissertations & Theses," Islas-Lopez, MariaIslas-LopezMariaIslas-Lopez, Maria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3182279031 , 84630232 , 66569 , 9781303645631 , 3607152 , 3607152", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303645631, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1477559197?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology"," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology"," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology",," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology"," Social research , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cognition , Culture , Future thinking , Mexican migration , Oaxacan migration , Projectivity , Qualitative analysis , Social research , Social theory , Temporality , Transnational migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Future+in+the+present%3A+Projective+practices+in+a+transnational+migrant+community&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Islas-Lopez%2C+Maria&amp;isbn=9781303645631&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"642,Globalizing through the Vernacular: Gender/sexual Transnationalism and the Making of Sexual Minorities in Eastern India,"The dissertation explores how the globalizing expansion of LGBT and HIV-AIDS activism into global south locations such as India relies on transregional and translocal communities of gender/sexually variant persons, and yet subordinates them and associated discourses of gender/sexual difference within the tiered hierarchies of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender; particularly GTB) organizations and transnationally-funded HIV-AIDS intervention projects. Engaging with conversations and debates across transnational sexuality studies, transnational feminism, Marxist theories of capital, and literary approaches to cross-cultural translation, I argue that the globalizing expansion of gender/sexual identity and rights based politics in India takes place through mutually transformative, yet structurally constrained, intersections and translations between institutions such as funders, non-governmental organizations and the state on one hand, and networks, communities and subcultures of socio-economically marginalized gender/sexually variant persons (such as kothis, dhuranis and hijras ) on the other. Such transformative interactions both create new political possibilities, and reproduce hierarchies related to location, class, caste, gender/sexual marginality and social respectability. Even as translations with subcultural languages of gender/sexual variance enable the transnational expansion and hegemony of institutional categories of identity and representation, lower class/caste communities and discourses become positioned as `local' or `vernacular' relative to national and transnational formations of activism and discourse. On one hand, the reification of communities as `sexual minorities' and as local variants of transnational categories like transgender or `men who have sex with men' results in identitarian distinctions such as the homosexual/transgender divide that selectively enable certain political possibilities, but constrain many contextually flexible lived practices and fluid subject positions that become unintelligible in terms of emerging cartographies of identity. On the other hand, liberal discourses that valorize individual choice and gender/sexual fluidity may also elide mobile negotiations with privilege and power (such as locally variable distinctions between feminine insiders and masculine outsiders) in kothi, dhurani and hijra communities. Further, dominant forms of activism based on discourses of equal rights and the private/public divide often cast lower class/caste persons and related practices as uncivil and/or criminal. Drawing upon five years of ethnographic research in eastern India, the dissertation critiques how hegemonic forms of identity and rights based politics produces lower class/caste groups as a victimized minorities and exploitable labor pools, rather than as active and full participants in the transnational movement for LGBT rights.",1477858815,,Dissertations & Theses," Dutta, AniruddhaDuttaAniruddhaDutta, Aniruddha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3183386361 , 81055112 , 66569 , 9781303612947 , 3605206 , 3605206", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303612947, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1477858815?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Cultural anthropology , GLBT Studies , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Biopolitics , Globalization , India , Sexual minorities , Transgender , Vernacular",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Globalizing+through+the+Vernacular%3A+Gender%2Fsexual+Transnationalism%0Aand+the+Making+of+Sexual+Minorities+in+Eastern+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dutta%2C+Aniruddha&amp;isbn=9781303612947&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"643,"South Asians and the problem of the color line: Migration, race, and identity in South Africa and the United States","Modern migration has resulted in the unsettlement of the identities of migrants who live, work, and struggle – for rights, opportunities, and recognition – with other populations in new national contexts. This dissertation considers the identities of South Asian migrants to South Africa and the United States, two nation-states that have been involved deeply in the creation of ideologies of race as well as regimes of racial practice. Focusing on the late 19th century to the late 20th century, I show how South Asian migrants were historically positioned within the racial hierarchies of these two societies, and how they constructed their identities in relation to racial others. I analyze contact, conflict, and cooperation between South Asians and other racial subjects in a comparative, cross-national perspective, and consider the transnational exchange of ideas that led to particular strategies of resistance. I argue that South Asian struggles in South Africa and the United States for rights and recognition resulted in a transnational articulation of modern social movements for national liberation, civil rights, and democracy.",1490558006,,Dissertations & Theses," Ramsamy, KavithaRamsamyKavithaRamsamy, Kavitha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3185987671 , 77628132 , 66569 , 9781303637704 , 3606595 , 3606595", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303637704, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1490558006?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0654 South African Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0654 South African Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0654 South African Studies",," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0654 South African Studies"," Geography , South Asian Studies , South African Studies"," Social sciences , Diaspora , Identity , Migrants , Race , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=South+Asians+and+the+problem+of+the+color+line%3A+Migration%2C+race%2C+and+identity+in+South+Africa+and+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ramsamy%2C+Kavitha&amp;isbn=9781303637704&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"644,(En)gendering Food Justice: Identity and Possibility Within The American Alternative Food Movement,"Research demonstrates that the contemporary global food system is unsustainable, and moreover, because some groups carry the burden of that unsustainability more than others, it is unjust. While some threads of food activism in the United States have attempted to respond to these structural based inequalities—primarily those of race, ethnicity, and social class—overall, very little domestic activism has focused on issues of gender. As feminist scholarship makes clear, however, a food movement ""gender gap"" does not mean that gender is irrelevant to food experiences, social activism, or agricultural sustainability. Building on a framework of feminist food studies, food justice activism, and feminist social movement theory, this dissertation makes the case for ""(en)gendering"" the domestic alternative food activist movement, first by demonstrating how gender shapes experiences within food movement spaces, and second, by exploring the impact that an absence of gender awareness has on the individual, community, and organizational levels of the movement. Employing a feminist-informed hybrid of grounded theory and social movement research methods, field research for this dissertation was conducted in community gardens located in Seattle, Washington and Phoenix, Arizona during the summers of 2011 and 2012. With the assistance of NVivo qualitative data analysis software, field notes and twenty-one key-informant interviews were analyzed, as were the discourses found in the publically available marketing materials and policies of domestic food justice organizations. This study's findings at the individual and community level are hopeful, suggesting that when men are involved in food movement work, they become more aware of food-based gender inequalities and more supportive of women's leadership opportunities. Additionally, at the organizational level, this study also finds that where food sovereignty is influencing domestic activism, gender is beginning to enter the discussion. The project concludes with policy recommendations for both community gardening and food justice organizations and the detailing of a new concept of ""feminist food justice"", with the end goal of preventing the food movement from undermining its own potential to secure a ""real alternative"" to corporate industrial agriculture.",1490994085,,Dissertations & Theses," Woodbury, AliciaWoodburyAliciaWoodbury, Alicia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3187884601 , 78550982 , 66569 , 9781303619540 , 3605488 , 3605488", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303619540, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1490994085?accountid=14496," 0359 Food Science , 0733 Gender studies"," 0359 Food Science , 0733 Gender studies"," 0359 Food Science , 0733 Gender studies",," 0359 Food Science , 0733 Gender studies"," Food Science , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Community gardens , Feminist , Food justice , Gender , Leadership",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%28En%29gendering+Food+Justice%3A+Identity+and+Possibility+Within+The+American+Alternative+Food+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Woodbury%2C+Alicia&amp;isbn=9781303619540&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"645,An analysis of John Stott's understanding of the theological relationship between evangelism and social responsibility,"This dissertation analyzes John R. W. Stott's understanding of the theological relationship between evangelism and social responsibility. Chapter 1 defines important terms and states the case for researching John Stott's views on the subject. Chapter 2 presents a biographical sketch of John Stott's life, giving particular attention to his theological and social contexts which shaped his views on the tension between evangelism and social responsibility. Chapter 3 explores Stott's views on evangelism and social responsibility from the perspective of his pastoral ministry. Stott's role as rector at All Souls, Langham Place in London provided the ministry framework for Stott's practice and theology of evangelism. Furthermore, while in his role as pastor, Stott's views on social responsibility began to shift. Chapter 4 examines Stott's international ministry within the Lausanne movement and his books that address the topic of evangelism and social responsibility. This stage of Stott's ministry was the primary arena where he adapted and implemented his understanding of the partnership between evangelism and social responsibility. Chapter 5 recognizes Stott's broad influence on this topic among evangelical thinkers and surveys consequences related to the topic that developed as a result of Stott's position. Chapter 6 analyzes Stott's understanding of evangelism and social responsibility theologically, exegetically, and practically. This chapter evaluates Stott's position exegetically, theologically, and practically and encapsulates the strengths and weaknesses of his position. Chapter 7 concludes the dissertation by offering a discussion of discipleship as the proper place of social responsibility in the Christian life. As a final means of analysis, implications raised by Stott's understanding are presented and explored in light of greater evangelicalism.",1491384865,,Dissertations & Theses," Hefner, Christopher ClaytonHefnerClaytonChristopherHefner, Christopher Clayton",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3190017791 , 80208102 , 66569 , 9781303647727 , 3607253 , 3607253", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303647727, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1491384865?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology,, 0469 Theology, Theology," Philosophy, religion and theology , Evangelism , Missions , Social justice , Social responsibility",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+John+Stott%27s+understanding+of+the+theological+relationship+between+evangelism+and+social+responsibility&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hefner%2C+Christopher+Clayton&amp;isbn=9781303647727&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"646,Creating Moral Authority and Collective Action Frames: Christian Pulpit Monologues in the Ex-Gay Movement,"The Christian ex-gay movement was born in 1973 with the founding of Exodus International, which would soon become an international umbrella ministry purporting reparative ""ex-gay"" therapies as a viable method of dealing with ""unwanted same-sex attractions"". In 2012, then-president of Exodus, Alan Chambers, renounced reparative therapies in recognition of the wide-spread harm they had caused. In June of 2013, Chambers announced his intention to close Exodus' doors. Aspects of minority discrimination inherent to the broader Christian sex prescription and mirrored in the Christian ex-gay movement are discussed, along with the influence of the Post-Victorian conceptualization of sexuality on ex-gay ideology, the social movement ideologies driving the reparative therapeutic model, and the ex-gay and pro-gay Christian hermeneutics of the queer-relevant Biblical canon. In its final days, Exodus International served as a methodological tool to discern ex-gay collective action frames. The present research purposively sampled Exodus Association member churches and qualitatively analyzed the framing work performed by Exodus Association pastors in sermons addressing homosexuality. The data was coded according to the core collective action framing tasks conceptualized by David Snow and Robert Benford: diagnosis, prognosis, and motivation. A clear division among the churches emerged as themes from the ""pulpit discourse"" unfolded, one faction emphasizing truths and objectifying the issue of homosexuality, and the other faction emphasizing grace and humanizing homosexuals as people. The division of member churches of the now-dead Exodus Association into truth and grace perspectives is discussed as a reflection of the splintering of the larger ex-gay movement.",1491852679,,Dissertations & Theses," Schmidgall, DarciSchmidgallDarciSchmidgall, Darci",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3191837601 , 84911052 , 66569 , 9781303629143 , 1549839 , 1549839", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303629143, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1491852679?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0393 Epistemology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0318 Religion , 0393 Epistemology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0318 Religion , 0393 Epistemology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0318 Religion , 0393 Epistemology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Religion , Epistemology , GLBT Studies , Organizational behavior"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Alan chambers , Ex-gay movement , Exodus international , Queer christianity , Reparative therapy , Same-sex attraction",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creating+Moral+Authority+and+Collective+Action+Frames%3A+Christian+Pulpit+Monologues+in+the+Ex-Gay+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schmidgall%2C+Darci&amp;isbn=9781303629143&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"647,"Irresistible Revolution: Cuba and American Radicalism, 1968–1992","This dissertation examines the nexus between the Cuban Revolution and the American Left, and the impact of this engagement upon U.S.-Cuba relations. Beginning in the social upheaval of the 1960s and concluding with the decline of the Cold War, I argue that the Cuban Revolution became a significant foreign influence on U.S. radicalism as Americans looked to Cuba for alternatives to capitalism, racism, and U.S. global hegemony. Focusing upon African American, Cuban American, and White American leftists who traveled to Cuba as solidarity activists, political exiles, and air hijackers, I show how Cuba's global image as an idealized model of Third World self determination and a portal to global leftism inspired leftwing Americans to remake themselves as global political actors beyond the geographical and conceptual bounds of the U.S. state. As American dissidents increasingly linked demands for domestic racial and economic justice to global forces, such as decolonization and opposition to U.S. influence, Cuba became a conspicuous part of the U.S. leftwing cultural imaginary as Americans constructed it as an ""idealized imagined nation."" Although engaging with Cuba as non-state actors, I show how American dissidents nevertheless became unlikely historical agents, repeatedly influencing U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations in ways that shed new light upon the relationship between domestic social movements and American foreign policy. Utilizing U.S. and Cuban sources, the study illuminates a hitherto overlooked group of historical actors to reveal a hidden narrative of U.S.-Cuba relations and the American Left during the global Cold War. Broadening the scope of the ""ties of singular intimacy"" that have traditionally been the focus of studies of U.S.-Cuba relations, the study reveals a unique set of transnational encounters that have linked Cuba inseparably with American history.",1492732772,,Dissertations & Theses," Latner, Teishan AaronLatnerAaronTeishanLatner, Teishan Aaron",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3195728281 , 74848362 , 66569 , 9781303641770 , 3606866 , 3606866", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303641770, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492732772?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," African American Studies , American studies , Black history , Latin American history , American history , Modern history , International Relations"," Social sciences , 1960s , Cuba , Leftism , Protest , Radicalism , Social movements , United States foreign policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Irresistible+Revolution%3A+Cuba+and+American+Radicalism%2C+1968%E2%80%931992&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Latner%2C+Teishan+Aaron&amp;isbn=9781303641770&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"648,"Between dictatorship and dissent: Ideology, legitimacy, and human rights in East Germany, 1945–1990","The project examines how the idea of human rights developed in East Germany, first as a tool of legitimization by the socialist state, and eventually by East Germans themselves, in a citizen-based social movement, to radically alter the Cold War status quo in 1989. In response to West German attacks against their control over East Germany after the Second World War, the ruling East German Socialist Unity Party (SED) adopted the language of human rights in order to undermine its opponents and legitimize its rule. The deployment of the language of human rights by the East German state went well beyond simple sloganeering: in 1959, the SED created the Eastern Bloc's only state-sponsored human rights organization – two years before the founding of Amnesty International. East German intellectuals loyal to the state developed a unique ideological conception of ""socialist human rights,"" that reimagined the SED dictatorship as a champion of human rights superior to those in the imperialist West.

Only in the late 1980s did activists re-appropriate the language of human rights for the cause of democratization, drawing on inspiration from Western activists, Eastern dissidents, and South American human rights activists, to claim that they – and not the state – were the true champions of both socialism and human rights.

While various causes within the sphere of social reform captured his attention, Tolstoy considered a national education program for the newly emancipated Russian serfs to be his top priority and his most joyful and engaging pursuit. Rather than using the template of civilization for a re-education of the peasant, Tolstoy saw in the simplicity of the peasant a basis for the reformation of society. Unfortunately, political forces have long censored and marginalized his extra-literary activities so that many people have been unable to appreciate the very real contributions he made to the fields of social justice and education--both contributions that have application to the problems faced by underprivileged students everywhere. This paper, then, traces the history of Tolstoy's work as a social reformer from the formation of his early views on education to his short stories and essays designed to attract the minds of a newly literate public. Drawing on Tolstoy's correspondence, newspaper accounts from the era, biographical evidence, and the work of several Tolstoy scholars, this paper pieces together Tolstoy's views on topics such as nonviolence, Christianity, and politics in order to form a detailed portrait of Tolstoy as both social reformer and educationist. I argue that his work in this area laid the groundwork for numerous social justice causes in Russia and abroad, and that Tolstoy's considerable influence extends both as far as modern progressive movements in education, and as deep as the nonviolent resistance movements of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",1493009002,,Dissertations & Theses," Flaherty, Patricia J.FlahertyJ.PatriciaFlaherty, Patricia J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3197769701 , 85048192 , 66569 , 9781303644207 , 3607040 , 3607040", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303644207, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1493009002?accountid=14496," 0515 Education , 0520 Education history , 0614 Slavic Studies"," 0515 Education , 0520 Education history , 0614 Slavic Studies"," 0515 Education , 0520 Education history , 0614 Slavic Studies",," 0515 Education , 0520 Education history , 0614 Slavic Studies"," Education , Education history , Slavic Studies"," Social sciences , Education , Education , National education programs , Social justice , Social reform , Tolstoy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Leo+Tolstoy%2C+social+reformer+and+educationist&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Flaherty%2C+Patricia+J.&amp;isbn=9781303644207&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"650,"Catholic student movements in Latin America: Cuba and Brazil, 1920s to 1960s","This dissertation examines the ideological development of the Catholic University Student (JUC) movements in Cuba and Brazil during the Cold War and their organizational predecessors and intellectual influences in interwar Europe. Transnational Catholicism prioritized the attempt to influence youth and in particular, university students, within the context of Catholic nations within Atlantic civilization in the middle of the twentieth century. This dissertation argues that the Catholic university movements achieved a relatively high level of social and political influence in a number of countries in Latin America and that the experience of the Catholic student activists led them to experience ideological conflict and in some cases, rupture, with the conservative ideology of the Catholic hierarchy. Catholic student movements flourished after World War II in the context of an emerging youth culture. The proliferation of student organizations became part of the ideological battlefield of the Cold War. Catholic university students also played key roles in the Cuban Revolution (1957-1959) and in the attempted political and social reforms in Brazil under President João Goulart (1961-1964). The JUC, under the guidance of the Church hierarchy, attempted to avoid aligning itself with either ideological camp in the Cold War, but rather to chart a Third Way between materialistic capitalism and atheistic socialism. Thousands of students in over 70 nations were intensively trained to think critically about pressing social issues. This paper will to place the Catholic Student movement in Cuba in the larger context of transnational Catholic university movements using archival evidence, newspaper accounts and secondary sources. Despite the hierarchy's attempt to utilize students as a tool of influence, the actual lived experience of students equipped them to think critically about social issues, and helped lay a foundation for the progressive student politics of the late 1960s and the rise of liberation theology in the 1970s.",1496775153,,Dissertations & Theses," Holbrook, JosephHolbrookJosephHolbrook, Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3213983691 , 85382502 , 66569 , 9781303671104 , 3608718 , 3608718", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303671104, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1496775153?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history"," Religious history , Latin American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Brazil , Catholic action , Catholicism , Cuba , Latin america , Revolution",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Catholic+student+movements+in+Latin+America%3A+Cuba+and+Brazil%2C+1920s+to+1960s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holbrook%2C+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781303671104&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"651,"Diasporic imperialism Japan's Asia-Pacific migrations and the making of the Japanese empire, 1868-1945","This dissertation argues that the Japanese modern nation was formed not only from the inside but also from the outside, through nationalizing Japanese emigrants around the Pacific Rim. The study examines critical roles of Japanese overseas emigrants in shaping the ideologies and social movements in the Japanese empire. It discusses how the efforts made by Japanese thinkers and social educators in nationalizing these dispersed and marginal subjects were crucial to the creation of Japanese modernity. This study defines Japanese imperialism as ""diasporic"" in three dimensions. First, it illustrates the close and dynamic connections Japanese migration to the empire's Asian colonies and to other parts of the world. In particular, it highlights the important yet unexpected ways in which Japanese American migration influenced and transformed Japan's colonial expansion in Asia. Second, the study examines how the Japanese diasporic communities on both sides of the Pacific shaped the Japanese nation and empire at home. Third, from a more theoretical level, it explores the dual identity of Japanese imperialism between colonizer and the colonized. By examining flows and linkages between Japanese colonial migration in Asia and Japanese labor migration to America, this study charts the evolving trajectory of Japan as a colored empire in the cultural and political space between Asia and the West. This dissertation is a study of the Japanese empire from the angle of Japan's global migration. It challenges the separation between the nation-based narrative of modern Japan and the history of Japanese overseas migration. It also moves beyond the territory-based study of the Japanese empire by bridging the disciplinary divide between Japanese colonial history and Japanese American history and brings a transnational and global perspective to our understanding of the Japanese empire.",1498121713,,Dissertations & Theses," Lu, Sidney XuLuXuSidneyLu, Sidney Xu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3218632471 , 82427952 , 66569 , 9781303679179 , 3609200 , 3609200", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303679179, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1498121713?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0578 History"," 0332 History , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0578 History"," 0332 History , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0578 History",," 0332 History , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0578 History"," History , Asian American Studies"," Social sciences , Diaspora , Expansionism , Japanese imperialism , Overseas migration , Prostitution , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Diasporic+imperialism+Japan%27s+Asia-Pacific+migrations+and+the+making+of+the+Japanese+empire%2C+1868-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lu%2C+Sidney+Xu&amp;isbn=9781303679179&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"652,"Writing America: Transnational discourses of empire, race, and community formation in greater mexico","My dissertation dialogues with current criticism in U.S. Latina/o Studies, Latin American Studies, and American Studies that seeks to move beyond notions of resistance and antagonism as the essential paradigm for understanding Anglo-Hispanic political and cultural relations in the Americas. I argue that throughout the nineteenth century Mexicans and Mexican Americans envisioned and worked to create strategic alliances with Anglo Americans on the basis of cultural, political, and racial affinities. Through my analysis of literary and historical writings by authors from the Yucatán, California, Southern Texas, and New Mexico, I uncover an alternative historical and literary tradition that imagined the fruitful possibilities of intercultural and transnational coalitions--rather than antagonistic relationships--between Anglo Americans, Mexicans, and Mexican Americans. In particular, I look at the ways in which Mexicans and Mexican Americans negotiated non-progressive discourses of Spanishness, whiteness, and European cosmopolitanism, strategically repurposing these discourses to fit their own needs as well as those of their communities, in order to secure a space of agency for themselves in a hemispheric community of white elites. Each of my chapters focuses on a different region and a different author: Justo Sierra O'Reilly (Yucatán); María Amparo Ruiz de Burton (California); Eusebio Chacón (New Mexico); and Jovita González (South Texas). My research moves beyond a North-South (U.S. and Latin America) or trans-Atlantic outlook on empire studies and postcolonial studies, towards a deeper assessment of the triangular movement of discourses, people, and goods between the U.S., Spanish America, and Europe (including Spain). I build upon critical approaches to Chicano/a and Latino/a Studies that are sensitive to the multiplicity of colonialisms experienced by Spanish Americans and U.S. Latinos/as. In particular, my dissertation looks at these intersecting and transnational discourses in the context of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Greater Mexico. I examine texts that cross national borders and create transnational dialogues, through real or imagined connections between Mexico, the United States, and Spain. In addition, I analyze the ways in which imperial forces and discourses overlapped and were used by diverse communities as sources of social empowerment (and sometimes social disempowerment) and cultural capital.",1502868966,,Dissertations & Theses," Kinnally, Cara A.KinnallyA.CaraKinnally, Cara A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3231787641 , 85786852 , 66569 , 9781303723681 , 3611492 , 3611492", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303723681, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1502868966?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0323 American studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0323 American studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0323 American studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0323 American studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Latin American literature , American studies , Hispanic American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , American studies , Mexican american literature , Mexican literature , Nineteenth-century literature , Transnational studies , U.s. latino literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Writing+America%3A+Transnational+discourses+of+empire%2C+race%2C+and+community+formation+in+greater+mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kinnally%2C+Cara+A.&amp;isbn=9781303723681&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"653,The economic foundations of modern Catholic social teaching: Past and prospect,"This dissertation describes how nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century, secular, solidarist economics and social thought, finding Catholic expression in the writings of Bishop Wilhelm von Ketteler, Matteo Liberatore, S.J., and Heinrich Pesch, S.J., served as the economic foundation of modern Catholic social teaching in Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum and Pope Pius XI's 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno . These encyclicals challenged laissez faire capitalism and the liberal economics and the individualistic, utilitarian assumptions that guided it. They significantly influenced world events when Catholics used them to help enact social legislation and create institutions that reflected their teaching, as evidenced by France's welfare state, the International Labour Organization, United States labor laws, and Germany's post-World-War-II economic reconstruction. The study traces how the Catholic principle of solidarity and the Church's advocacy of solidarist economic principles developed to address international concerns during the pontificates of Pius XII, John XXIII, and Paul VI. Close attention is given to John Paul II's theological development of the principle of solidarity in his social encyclicals and his advocacy of solidarist economic positions, closely aligned with Pesch's economics, in Centesimus annus . These were influential in defining Poland's Solidarity Movement in the 1980s; but Poland's transition from a socialist to a market economy is appraised as an example of how commitments to solidarist principles and policies can be subverted by pressures to conform to a dominant capitalist ethic and institutional framework. The study argues that the rising influence of this capitalist ethic, supported by neoclassical economic theory and with the United States as model, has led to the diminished persuasiveness of the Church's solidarist positions for business and political leaders and the Catholic faithful. As a help in restoring the Church's influence, the study assesses contemporary economic research in social capital theory and in new-institutional, behavioral, and evolutionary economics. The study examines Benedict XVI's encyclical Caritas in veritate as an illustration of how this economic research, sharing the same economic roots, historical and inductive methods, and emphasis on social norms as Catholic solidarism, can increase Catholic social teaching's economic persuasiveness as part of a secular apologetic.",1504644086,,Dissertations & Theses," Nixon, Mark GeoffreyNixonGeoffreyMarkNixon, Mark Geoffrey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3238458501 , 80409732 , 66569 , 9781303729768 , 3611876 , 3611876", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303729768, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1504644086?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0509 Economic history"," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0509 Economic history"," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0509 Economic history",," 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0509 Economic history"," Ethics , Theology , Economic history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Behavioral and institutional economics , Papal encyclicals , Pesch, heinrich , Social capital , Social ethics , Solidarity and solidarist economics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+economic+foundations+of+modern+Catholic+social+teaching%3A+Past+and+prospect&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nixon%2C+Mark+Geoffrey&amp;isbn=9781303729768&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"654,Cultivating opportunity in the soil of crisis: Urban agriculture and local food in Michigan and California,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices. This project is an ethnographic study of the local food movement in southeastern Michigan and California conducted through urban agriculture experiments and participant observation of farmers markets, urban farms, farmers' cooperatives, community and school gardens, restaurants, non-profits, and local food distribution networks. It also included an online survey investigating motives to support and participate in the local food movement, a comparison between the physical environment, food system, and social environment in Michigan and California, and informal interviews with growers, producers, eaters, chefs, and business owners. It found that although California agriculture is dominant in crop diversity, growing season, and production volume, Michigan has advantages in water and land access, food safety legislation, and zoning ordinances that enable urban agriculture initiatives to be more successful.",1505373663,,Dissertations & Theses," Stauffer, Stefanie TorlaiStaufferTorlaiStefanieStauffer, Stefanie Torlai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3241588031 , 78955132 , 66569 , 9781303731914 , 3612035 , 3612035", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303731914, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1505373663?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0640 Sustainability"," 0626 Sociology , 0640 Sustainability"," 0626 Sociology , 0640 Sustainability",," 0626 Sociology , 0640 Sustainability"," Sociology , Sustainability"," Social sciences , ""privatization of survival"" , ""race to the bottom in food"" , Detroit , Local food , Michigan , Urban agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultivating+opportunity+in+the+soil+of+crisis%3A+Urban+agriculture+and+local+food+in+Michigan+and+California&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stauffer%2C+Stefanie+Torlai&amp;isbn=9781303731914&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"655,"“Lesbianas presente:” Lesbian activism, transnational alliances, and the state in Mexico City, 1968–1991","My dissertation examines the emergence of lesbian movements in Mexico City in the context of the Cold War and the onset of economic neo-liberalism. A transnational approach is crucial to understand the constitution of these movements because they responded and contributed to global sexuality rights movements as well as to the global Left. During this time, Mexican lesbians allied with the political Left offering support to socialist and anti-imperialist groups. In turn, the government treated lesbian activists as they did the Left, monitoring and harassing lesbians and their organizations in an effort to weaken the groups' influence on civil society. Confronting this state repression as well as increasing economic instability throughout the 1980s, Mexican lesbian activists organized in coalitions with local, national, and international actors defending gay, lesbian, and human rights and pressing for the democratization of the Mexican state. Challenging Western understandings of the utilization of human rights discourse as a liberal construct, my research reveals that Mexican lesbian activists' use of these discourses was grounded in their work with anti-imperialist movements in Latin America to democratize the state from the grassroots. They used human rights rhetoric not only to uphold individual civil and political rights, but also to demand social and economic rights and to express solidarity with other marginalized groups working to democratize authoritarian states in Latin America. In particular, my study focuses on the anti-imperialist politics that Mexican lesbians brought to international organizing for lesbian and homosexual liberation and to the politics of lesbian and homosexual liberation that they sought to instill in the Mexican Left. As part of efforts to further lesbian and gay rights, Mexican lesbians also became leaders in international activism, particularly by their participation in campaigns and conferences of the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA).",1507464816,,Dissertations & Theses," Grinnell, LucindaGrinnellLucindaGrinnell, Lucinda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3246548091 , 83760152 , 66569 , 9781303743047 , 3612575 , 3612575", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303743047, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1507464816?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies"," Latin American history , GLBT Studies"," Social sciences , Cold war , Lesbians , Mexico , Neo-liberalism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CLesbianas+presente%3A%E2%80%9D+Lesbian+activism%2C+transnational%0Aalliances%2C+and+the+state+in+Mexico+City%2C+1968%E2%80%931991&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grinnell%2C+Lucinda&amp;isbn=9781303743047&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"656,Migration and development in context: The Social and Economic Impact of Labor Migration on Children Left Behind,"The relationship between migration and development cannot be underestimated and it is becoming increasingly clear that the two phenomena are connected in economic, political, anthropological, demographic, cultural, and social terms. Issues of migration can no longer afford to be addressed as if they were independently acting forces and it must be recognized that studying migration and migratory patterns involves analyzing many different forces, which work both with and against one another. Furthermore, migration has always been and is becoming increasingly more of an issue of international relations, affecting bilateral as well as multilateral relations between states. Migratory movements of any kind have the potential to cause tensions between states or to foster a relationship of mutual benefit and even friendship. Until recently, the migration-development dialogue has focused mainly on the economic side of the issue, neglecting most other aspects, the social aspect in particular. The following research paper presents evidence of the importance of addressing social issues, which migration has an effect on. The thesis examines the effect of labor migration on the children, families, and elderly left behind in countries of origin, addressing the different existing trends within this field. The research focuses on the post-Soviet region, mainly because of the many migratory movements following the events of 1991, deriving its case studies from Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The results expose some of the differences and similarities between the experiences in these three countries, suggesting that a much more comprehensive policy is needed to minimize the negative impact of parental migration on children and other vulnerable groups. The research pays particular attention to the recent trend of the feminization of migration, illuminating the specific effects of female migration on the wellbeing of left-behind children and left-behind families. The thesis concludes with suggestions for future research and possible policy objectives, stressing that the issues described are of international concern, thus requiring a holistic approach on a bilateral, multilateral, and international level.",1508571233,,Dissertations & Theses," Yanovich, YelizavetaYanovichYelizavetaYanovich, Yelizaveta",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3250381961 , 79367982 , 66569 , 9781303788208 , 1525063 , 1525063", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303788208, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1508571233?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0534 Social studies education , 0616 International law"," 0501 Economics , 0534 Social studies education , 0616 International law"," 0501 Economics , 0534 Social studies education , 0616 International law",," 0501 Economics , 0534 Social studies education , 0616 International law"," Economics , Social studies education , International law"," Social sciences , Education , Children left behind , Development , Labor migration , Migration in Georgia , Migration in Moldova , Migration in Ukraine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migration+and+development+in+context%3A++The+Social+and+Economic+Impact+of+Labor+Migration+on+Children+Left+Behind&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yanovich%2C+Yelizaveta&amp;isbn=9781303788208&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"657,Ethnography trans type: A model from research continuos time-space. Case studies: The ethnics groups transnational mixteca and kichwa-otavalo,"This thesis aims to propose a methodological theory that can contribute to the understanding of transnational studies in the disciplines of social sciences and especially anthropology. The central idea has been to emphasize that the way of doing ethnography in transnational corporations shall include tools for the study of social movement and speed, as it ponders inquiry research time in conjunction with the space. Through a complex theoretical explanation was concluded that the categories used by researchers should be reformulated to include other ways of understanding the transnational time, and that if the space has been ""deterritorialized"" by the action of capital in turn, then the time has also undergone a transformation becoming ""detemporalized"". I have called this process trans- ethnography , as observed emphasizes the transformation of social space-time continuum . The empirical work carried out for this research has been done on a comparative basis with two transnational indigenous groups: The Mixtecs whose ancestral home is located in the geographical center of Mexico ( intercontinental transmigration ) and Kichwa - Otavalo whose ancestral home is housed in geography of northern Ecuador ( transcontinental transmigration ) . These two groups have been constituted by particular historical processes such as transnational corporations in more than one nation-state, in this way, the field has a transcontinental analytical depth ( America and Europe ) in two hemispheres (north and south) and two conceptual ( indigenous and non-indigenous world ) so postmodernly transmigrants indigenous systems have been deployed at different speeds between nation-states in the service of the productive systems of capital in turn. Ethnographically in the thesis are several tips that can be included as inputs in transnational investigations, for example, the concept of space-time as a major non-human social system composed of human elements and create intelligibility of time and social space, as well as the concept of energy (interest rate) using the concept of ""habitus"" of Pierre Bourdieu is a ""source, recycling and consumption"" of transnational social relations, finally, the concept of the curvature of space-time social, can understand time beyond class time and arbitrary shapes a transnational social temporality.",1512221592,,Dissertations & Theses," Morales Lopez, Julio UlisesMorales LopezUlisesJulioMorales Lopez, Julio Ulises",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264230061 , 86576142 , 66569 , 9781303769405 , 3613665 , 3613665", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303769405, Spanish, Spanish,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512221592?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0366 Geography"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0366 Geography"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0366 Geography",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research , 0366 Geography"," Cultural anthropology , Social research , Geography"," Social sciences , Etnicidad , Etnografia , Fronteras , Migracion , Movilidad , Transnacionalismo",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ethnography+trans+type%3A+A+model+from+research+continuos+time-space.+%0ACase+studies%3A+The+ethnics+groups+transnational+mixteca+and+kichwa-otavalo&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morales+Lopez%2C+Julio+Ulises&amp;isbn=9781303769405&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"658,"'better active today than radioactive tomorrow!': transnational opposition to nuclear energy in france and west germany, 1968-1981","This thesis examines the opposition to civil nuclear energy in France and West Germany during the 1970s, arguing that small-scale interactions among its diverse participants led to broad changes in their personal lives and political environments. Drawing extensively on oral history interviews with former activists as well as police reports, media coverage and protest ephemera, this thesis shows how individuals at the grassroots built up a movement that transcended national (and social) borders. They were able to do so in part because nuclear power was such a multivalent symbol at the time. Residents of towns near planned power stations felt that nuclear technology represented an intervention in their community by state and industry, a potential threat to their health, wealth and way of life. In the decade after 1968, concerns like these coalesced with criticisms of capitalism, the state, militarism and consumer society that were being made by a more politicised constituency. This made the anti-nuclear movement both broad-based and highly fragmented. Activist networks linked people across existing national, political and social boundaries, but the social world of activism was subject to its own divisions (such as between locals and outsiders or between militant and non-violent activists). By analysing both the transnational dimensions and internal divisions of the anti-nuclear movement, this thesis revises the homogenising concepts of social movements that are prevalent in much of the existing sociological and political science literature. At the same time, it situates the anti-nuclear movement historically within the decade of upheaval that was the 1970s, while moving individual activists from the margins to the centre of protest history.",1512398686,,Dissertations & Theses," Tompkins, Andrew S.TompkinsS.AndrewTompkins, Andrew S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264697401 , 86584282 , 101309 , U605291 , U605291 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4af6ec03-08ba-4c3f-a8c9-fffc4f26aa34", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512398686?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4af6ec03-08ba-4c3f-a8c9-fffc4f26aa34 , (UMI)AAIU605291 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27better+active+today+than+radioactive+tomorrow%21%27%3A+transnational+opposition+to+nuclear+energy+in+france+and+west+germany%2C+1968-1981&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tompkins%2C+Andrew+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"659,Mobilising against domestic violence: women's movements in the domestic and international context of latin america,"Women's movements are key actors for adding domestic violence against women to the public agenda and for influencing the adoption of policies that deal with it. The aim of this thesis is to determine what strategies women's movements use to obtain policies and legislation on domestic violence against women, and how they adapt these strategies according to specific political actors that are proposed to be more helpful to women's movements' attempts. It proposes that women's movements direct their mechanisms towards social, international and especially domestic political spheres. Two actors pertaining to the political sphere, women in the nationallegislarure and the women's policy agency, influence the strategies that women's movements use, the movements' chances of success, and the extent to which the movements need to interact with the other twO spherc=s. social and international. I use a '1ualirativc= small-N comparison of t four SQuth-American countries, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. The main data collection is through personal face-to-face interviews with members of women's organisations as well as '1uc=scionnaires sent to them. The findings suppon the relevance of the twO actors of the political sphere and suggest that women's movement vary their strategies according to the variant characteristics of these actors, i.e. percentage of 1 women legislators and status of women's policy agengy. It also finds that women's movements always direct mechanisms towards the society, but they increase the interaction with 'the latter, again according to the aforementioned variation. Finally, it finds that strategies directed towards the international sphere, although relevant, are used less frequently by women's organisations. The theory can be extended further to other women's issues if it incorporates some additional political and social actors, as well as to other areas beyond South America. ,",1548710158,,Dissertations & Theses," Venegas, Tatiana ReinVenegasReinTatianaVenegas, Tatiana Rein",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3385958751 , 89359042 , 101309 , U612574 , U612574", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1548710158?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," Womens studies , Latin American Studies , Political science"," (UMI)AAIU612574 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mobilising+against+domestic+violence%3A+women%27s+movements+in+the+domestic+and+international+context+of+latin+america&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Venegas%2C+Tatiana+Rein&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"660,Tekun Uman and Tata Mon fistfight in heaven: Indigenous imaginaries and decolonization in Highland Guatemala,"This dissertation is a case study in the contemporary imaginaries and cultural politics of 'the indigenous.' It studies the transformations of a piece of ""commons"" in the highland Maya town of San Juan Sacatepéquez, Guatemala as it went—beginning with the 1992 Columbus quincentennial—from being a weedy and abandoned lot to a Maya ceremonial site to a cultural and natural heritage site of the nation. From 2002-2006 this site was integrated into a International Labor Organization Convention 169 land rights project, which in turn created a national Maya nongovernmental organization (NGO), which involved the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture—all on behalf of a plaintiff group composed of Maya cooperativists and guerrillas turned activist ajq'ija' (Maya spiritual guides). This work follows the dialogic encounters between these indigenous community organizers and the Maya NGO professionals running this project, all of whom were operating within the transnational social field of human rights and development. These dialogues reveal a series of differently situated understandings of politically contested terms such as ""indigenous,"" ""rights,"" ""community,"" ""authority;"" ""representation,"" ""culture,"" and ""land."" Although each of these actors speak of themselves as belonging to a "" movimiento indfgena "", and thus of sharing a common struggle for decolonization, racial equality, and social justice, their differential access to capital—social, cultural, political, and economic—makes their articulation into a single social movement extremely contentious and problematic, and yet seemingly natural and propitious.",1616709150,,Dissertations & Theses," Jones, Christopher NewellJonesNewellChristopherJones, Christopher Newell",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3472406731 , 77889532 , 66569 , 9781321323344 , 3581744 , 3581744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781321323344, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1616709150?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Indigenous Community , Maya Community Organizers , Maya Decolonization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tekun+Uman+and+Tata+Mon+fistfight+in+heaven%3A+Indigenous+imaginaries+and+decolonization+in+Highland+Guatemala&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Christopher+Newell&amp;isbn=9781321323344&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"661,"Advocacy as Political Strategy: The emergence of an ""Education for All"" campaign at &lt;i&gt;ActionAid International&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt; Asia South Pacific Association for Basic and Adult Education&lt;/i&gt;","This dissertation explores why and how political advocacy emerged as a dominant organizational strategy for NGOs in the international development education field. In order to answer this central question, I adopt a comparative case-study approach, examining the evolution of policy advocacy positions at two leading NGOs in the field: ActionAid International and the Asia South Pacific Association for Basic and Adult Education (ASPBAE). Although these organizations differ in significant ways, both place political advocacy at the centre of their mandates, and both have secured prominent positions in global educational governance. Through comparative analysis, I shed light on why these organizations have assumed leadership roles in a global advocacy movement. I focus on how the shift to policy advocacy reflects the internal environment of each organization as well as broader trends in the international development field. Ideas of structure and agency are thus central to my analysis. I test the applicability of two structural theories of social change: world polity theory and political opportunity theory ; as well as two constructivist approaches: strategic issue framing and international norm dynamics . I offer some thoughts on establishing a more dynamic relationship between structure and agency, drawing on Fligstein and McAdam’s concept of strategic action fields . In order to test the utility of these theoretical frameworks, the study begins with a historical account of how ActionAid and ASPBAE have shifted from service- and practice- oriented organizations into political advocates. These histories are woven into a broader story of normative change in the international development field. I then examine the development of a number of key advocacy strategies at each organization, tracing how decisions are made and implemented as well as how they are influenced by the broader environment. I find that while it is essential to understand how global trends and norms enable and constrain organizational strategy, the internal decision-making processes of each organization largely shape how strategies are crafted and implemented. These findings offer insight into the pursuit of advocacy as a political strategy and the role of NGOs in global social change.",1636535423,,Dissertations & Theses," Magrath, Bronwen AlexandraMagrathAlexandraBronwenMagrath, Bronwen Alexandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3528177281 , 92228332 , 66569 , 9781321389302 , 3666042 , 3666042", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781321389302, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1636535423?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0504 History of Oceania , 0516 Adult education"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0504 History of Oceania , 0516 Adult education"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0504 History of Oceania , 0516 Adult education",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0504 History of Oceania , 0516 Adult education"," Educational sociology , Asian Studies , History of Oceania , Adult education"," Social sciences , Education , Global educational governance , International development education , Non-governmental organizations , Transnational advocacy networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Advocacy+as+Political+Strategy%3A+The+emergence+of+an+%22Education%0Afor+All%22+campaign+at+ActionAid+International+and+the+%0AAsia+South+Pacific+Association+for+Basic+and+Adult+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Magrath%2C+Bronwen+Alexandra&amp;isbn=9781321389302&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"662,"Global gender policy development in the UN: A sociological exploration of the politics, processes, and language","The United Nations (UN) provided a stage for the evolution of a global women's movement and global gender equality policy in the 20 th century. My dissertation adds a unique perspective to the sociological literature on the global gender equality regime in that it focuses on the social construction of gender equality policy in the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) of the UN. The guiding research question for my project is ""How is gender equality policy socially constructed in UN's CSW?"" My goal is to unpack some of the processes and politics of knowledge and norm-production in the CSW in order to explore ways in which women and men around the world may be better able to shape and influence global gender equality policy and utilize it in their national contexts. Data collection involved 700 hours of ethnographic participant observation in and around the offices of the UN headquarters in New York City/NY. Much of these data were collected during a two month internship in Fall 2010 in the Division for the Advancement of Women (now UN Women). After the internship I accessed the field site through an annual UN ground-pass in my capacity as UN delegate and member of the International Committee of Sociologists for Women in Society (SWS). In this capacity I also observed and documented the CSW 53 meeting in 2009, the CSW 55 meeting in 2011, and the CSW 56 meeting in 2012. In addition I recorded, transcribed and analyzed 20 semi-structured in-depth interviews with UN staff members involved in the organizational logistics of the CSW, diplomats, country delegates, and global gender activists working in and around the CSW. My dissertation is structured in three core chapters that have been prepared as stand-alone publications. The first, ""Invisible Lives, Silenced Violence: Transphobic Gender Violence in Global Perspective;"" deals with the invisibility of queer bodies and the silencing of gender identity issues in the CSW. The chapter dissects the construction of macro social policy and links it to public health outcomes in UN member states, exemplified through evidence of transphobic hate crime in the US. In the chapter ""The Insider Outside: Accessibility and Access to the United Nations through the Lens of Feminist Standpoint Theory,"" I address insider/outsider issues in ethnography and access of civil society to the UN. Guided by feminist standpoint theory I explore fluid, shifting insiderness and outsiderness among women activists as well as myself as Non-American, former UN intern, white, educated scholar-activist. The third chapter ""'The Perfect Blend'-Sociologists for Women in Society's Global Public Sociology""; focuses on the relationship of scholarship and activism within SWS, and the benefits and challenges of SWS' engagement with UN politics and policy development since the mid-1990s. My hope is that my research can inform policymakers, researchers, students, peers, social movement organizations, and others that want to become agents of global social change with the goal to advance democracy and equal life chances regardless of sex, gender, gender identity, sexuality, race, class, religion, citizenship, ability or age.",1645957568,,Dissertations & Theses," Jauk, DanielaJaukDanielaJauk, Daniela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3560010101 , 93369522 , 66569 , 9781321482058 , 3671136 , 3671136", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781321482058, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1645957568?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," Womens studies , GLBT Studies , Sociology , Public policy , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Ethnography , Sociology , Transgender , United nations , Women human rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+gender+policy+development+in+the+UN%3A+A+sociological+exploration+of+the+politics%2C+processes%2C+and+language&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jauk%2C+Daniela&amp;isbn=9781321482058&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"663,New social movements and media: the case of the justice for bhopal movement in india,"A significant gap exists in the studies of the relation between media, memory and social movements in the global South, where both media and movements emerge as sites of globalisation and contestation due to the interdependence of global capital, media systems and local communities. This monograph on media, memory and social movements focuses on the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster and the Justice for Bhopal Movement, particularly the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. Through this case study it provides a postcolonial critique of New Social Movement (NSM) theory, and rethinks cultural fields, particularly in relation to transmediality and transnationality. The thesis studies NSM’s relationship with a shifting mediascape within the postcolonial context and shows that the relationship is shaped by conflicting tendencies imbibed through India’s anti-colonial struggle, as well as through globalisation in both communication technology and neoliberal capitalism. By considering cultural fields as transmedial worlds, this monograph reveals a dialectical relation between media, memory and new social movements through intersecting lines of inquiry into transmediality, transnationality and conflict within the post colonial context. It establishes the relevance of rethinking NSM in relation to transmediality and transnationality within the postcolonial context. It shows that activists succeeded in movement-building and shaping the media narrative by transmedia activism and storytelling, made possible by partnership between different classes that came together due to shared disenchantment with the postcolonial state and through transmedial mobilisation of memories. This study documents the complex history of the Bhopal conflict over memory and perception at a time when the movement is preparing to enter its 30 th year. The thesis uses the “campaign” as a framework of analysis, and draws on critical ethnography and multimodal analysis informed by an insider-outsider/activist-academic perspective to study a movement in action, where the specificity of the victims and their struggle against an American multinational in the time of globalisation provide an interesting context.",1651901810,,Dissertations & Theses," Sharma, ShaliniSharmaShaliniSharma, Shalini",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3581666511 , 93841572 , 101309 , U619276 , U619276 , http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/18259/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1651901810?accountid=14496, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0459 Communication, Communication," http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/18259/ , (UMI)AAIU619276 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+social+movements+and+media%3A+the+case+of+the+justice+for+bhopal+movement+in+india&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sharma%2C+Shalini&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"664,"The rupture in state-society relationships and the prominence of youth activism in Egypt opportunities, strategies and new models of mobilization","This thesis examines the development of youth activism in Egypt as key social actors during the latter years of Mubarak’s presidency (from 2000) and leading into the tumultuous events of the Revolution in January 2011. The assessment draws on social movement theory to provide an analytical framework, specifically the political process model. It first offers an analytical narrative of the political structures which have developed within Egypt in the modern era and which have provided the structural context within which such movements have emerged and developed, notably cycles of contentious politics. The narrative identifies the impact of early Nasserist hegemony, the subsequent embedding of corporatist structures for socio-political organisation, and the inhibiting effects these had on the development of autonomous social movements until the contemporary period. Youth and Student movements remained key political actors during specific historical periods but even these were severely constrained after 1979. This provides the structural scene setting for our in-depth study of contemporary youth activism. In attempting to explain the contemporary  re-emergence of youth activism during the January Revolution, the thesis proceeds to examine the political opportunities which were presented to social movements in general, and youth activism specifically, during the era of Mubarak’s rule, and with an emphasis on the period from 2000-2010. Developments in Egypt are analysed through the ordering devices offered by SMT, including the progressive rupturing of the state-society relationship, the high level of grievances among the population, the level of institutional access, and divisions among the ruling elite. The thesis adds an additional category – the role played by transnational and external factors – which emerged as an important influence in the preceding narrative of Egyptian political development but which have traditionally been neglected by SMT. The thesis further uses the analytical tools of SMT to examine two particular forms of youth mobilisation; the student movements and the April 6th movement. Successive chapters examine the strategic choices, organisation, framings and mobilisation strategies of these movements, drawing heavily on intensive semi- and un-structured interviewing and data collection, both in person and through the formats and devices of the social movements themselves (such as Facebook, Twitter and movement websites). The thesis demonstrates that these youth activism are better understood as New Social Movements (NSM) rather than conventional social movements. They have developed through horizontal networking rather than vertical and hierarchical organisations. They have drawn substantially on the political opportunities offered by transnational and external factors. In both these aspects, they have made good use of new informational and communications technologies, specifically the Internet, which create communicative linkages but do not offer a clear route to the next stage of formal political organisation (explaining in part the limitations of these movements). Finally, they demonstrate the importance of generational politics in Egypt, the grievances of which lie at the core of the rupture between state and society.",1651914039,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohamed, Ahmed Tohami AbdelhayMohamedTohami AbdelhayAhmedMohamed, Ahmed Tohami Abdelhay",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3581673511 , 80736992 , 101309 , U616246 , U616246 , http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/8502/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1651914039?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/8502/ , (UMI)AAIU616246 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+rupture+in+state-society+relationships+and+the+prominence+of+youth+activism+in+Egypt+opportunities%2C+strategies+and+new+models+of+mobilization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohamed%2C+Ahmed+Tohami+Abdelhay&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"665,Iraqi refugees' assisted and spontaneous return from syria and jordan,"The thesis investigates the causes and nature of return in the context of the Iraqis displaced to Syria and Jordan after the 2003 US-led war in Iraq. It combines critical International Relations theories with transnational approaches in Migration Studies to investigate: (1) how regional and international geopolitics have shaped asylum and migration regimes in the Middle East; (2) how Iraqi forced migrants have interacted with such regimes in order to reach safety, sustainable livelihoods and personal development opportunities and; (3) the decision-making processes and transnational migration practices of Iraqi individuals and families. It finds that Iraqis' returns result from the uneasy interaction between international and national asylum and migration regimes and the lack of agreement on a common legal framework for durable solutions to the Iraqi displacement. The presence and mobility of the Iraqis in Syria and Jordan are regulated within national immigration systems. The immigration and residency policies of the home and host governments confirm the historical importance of voluntary and involuntary population movements as a nation-building and governance tool in the Middle East. Regional governments and international agencies manage the Iraqi displaced and steer their return through the provision, or the lack thereof, of assistance and information. The Iraqis respond to the limited institutional assistance and information by developing independent coping strategies and informal information and communication systems based on the use of information and communication technologies and on their transnational mobility and social networks. Transnational mobility and livelihoods therefore constitute a precondition for Iraqis' sustainable return and reintegration in home societies undergoing political and socio-economic transition. In this context, return is a complex process that takes time and entails various degrees and modalities of transnational mobility, social networks and livelihoods connecting host and home societies.",1683347454,,Dissertations & Theses," Iaria, VanessaIariaVanessaIaria, Vanessa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3695926981 , 96341952 , 101309 , U634098 , U634098 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/45656/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1683347454?accountid=14496," 0511 Economic theory , 0938 Demography"," 0511 Economic theory , 0938 Demography"," 0511 Economic theory , 0938 Demography", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0511 Economic theory , 0938 Demography"," Economic theory , Demography"," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/45656/ , (UMI)AAIU634098 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Iraqi+refugees%27+assisted+and+spontaneous+return+from+syria+and+jordan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Iaria%2C+Vanessa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"666,"Green Star Japan: Language and internationalism in the Japanese Esperanto movement, 1905-1944","The planned language Esperanto achieved popularity in early twentieth century Japan, inspiring a national movement which was the largest outside Europe. Esperanto was designed to facilitate greater international and inter-cultural communication and understanding; the history of the language in Japan reveals a rich tradition of internationalism in Japan, stretching from the beginnings of the movement, in the wake of the Russo-Japanese war, through the end of the Pacific war, when, for a brief period, organised Esperanto in Japan ceased. Building upon existing studies of internationalism amongst elite opinion makers in Japan, this history of Esperanto reveals unexpected examples of internationalism amongst the broader Japanese public, a number of competing conceptions of the international world, and their realisation through a range of transnational activities. Esperanto was at once an intellectual phenomenon, and a language which could be put into immediate and concrete practice. The diversity of social groups and intellectual positions within the Japanese Esperanto community reveals internationalism and cosmopolitanism, not as well defined, static concepts, but as broad spaces in which different ideas of the world and the community of mankind could be debated. What linked the various different groups and individuals drawn into the Japanese Esperanto movement was a shared desire to make contact with, and help to reform, the world beyond Japan's borders, as well as a shared realisation of the vital role of language in making this contact possible. From radical socialists to conservative academics, and from Japanese diplomats at the League of Nations to members of rural communities in the deep north of Japan, although their politics often differed, Japanese Esperantists came together to participate in the re-imagining of the modern world; in doing so they became part of a transnational community, one which reveals insights into both modern Japanese history, and the nature of internationalism.",1683358279,,Dissertations & Theses," Rapley, IanRapleyIanRapley, Ian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3695939901 , 96345102 , 101309 , U632905 , U632905 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:fc299226-d3d5-4d01-8830-c3fe5df4f334", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1683358279?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0332 History , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0332 History , 0636 Sociolinguistics",," 0332 History , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," History , Sociolinguistics"," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:fc299226-d3d5-4d01-8830-c3fe5df4f334 , (UMI)AAIU632905 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Green+Star+Japan%3A+Language+and+internationalism+in+the+Japanese+Esperanto+movement%2C+1905-1944&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rapley%2C+Ian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"667,"Digging for compliments: rio tinto group, corporate social responsibility and the diffusion of international norms","It is a rare multinational corporation which neglects to express interest in Corporate Social Responsibility.

Of particular relevance for scholars of International Relations are lacunae in understanding how such an idea, value-based and emphasising organisational consistency, can be meaningful for actors operating simultaneously in many diverse locations, and under the freedom of international anarchy. Further, questions arise about what this phenomenon, reliant on ideas of good and bad, may illuminate about the movement of norms through the international system. These are the two interrelated problems that the dissertation seeks to address. Following a constructivist approach, the dissertation uses a qualitative case study method, focusing on one main corporate case (Rio Tinto Group). Insights derived from the main case study are then compared with two secondary corporate cases, to strengthen their validity and reliability. Key findings about the operational question, of how corporate social responsibility operates in multinational firms, point to the importance of broad, non-prescriptive and value-based policies at the global corporate level, with plenty of space for flexibility and variation in local implementation. In this way, corporations are able both to claim global consistency and local appropriateness. Insights about the movement of norms through the international system then follow, taking their cue from the well-known work of Finnemore and Sikkink (1998). The study finds that, while the essence of their ‘downwards’ model remains valid, applying it to the workings of international CSR points up limitations. Specifically, it appears that norms can move in various directions, not only ‘downwards’, but also ‘upwards’, as well as in cycles. Further, it appears that the direction of movement is influenced by local circumstances, and in particular the stability of the local political and economic environment.",1687709120,,Dissertations & Theses," Kruesman, MonikaKruesmanMonikaKruesman, Monika",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713037101 , 96795452 , 101309 , U640094 , U640094 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/715/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687709120?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0454 Management, Management," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/715/ , (UMI)AAIU640094 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Digging+for+compliments%3A+rio+tinto+group%2C+corporate+social+responsibility+and+the+diffusion+of+international+norms&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kruesman%2C+Monika&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"668,The Political Kinesthetics of Contemporary Dance: Taiwan in Transnational Perspective,"This dissertation considers dance practices emerging out of post-1980s conditions in Taiwan to theorize how contemporary dance negotiates temporality as a political kinesthetic performance. The dissertation attends to the ways dance kinesthetically responds to and mediates the flows of time, cultural identity, and social and political forces in its transnational movement. Dances negotiate disjunctures in the temporality of modernization as locally experienced and their global geotemporal mapping. The movement of performers and works pushes this simultaneous negotiation to the surface, as the aesthetics of the performances registers the complexity of the forces they are grappling with and their strategies of response. By calling these strategies “political kinesthetic” performance, I wish to highlight how politics, aesthetics, and kinesthetics converge in dance, and to show how political and affective economies operate with and through fully sensate, efforted, laboring bodies. I begin my discussion with the Cursive series performed by the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan, whose intersection of dance and cursive-style Chinese calligraphy initiates consideration of the temporal implication of “contemporary” as “contemporaneity” that underlies the simultaneous negotiation of local and transnational concerns. Extending from the Cursive series, I depart momentarily from the milieu of Taiwan to engage with two contemporaneous transnational Chinese choreographers whose works blend dance and Chinese calligraphy differently as a way to problematize further the performance of “Chineseness” and the economy of forces and power at work in the transnational. The dissertation then takes up another prime case of temporal reconfiguration, examining the Legend Lin Dance Theatre of Taiwan and its artistic director Lin Lee-Chen’s early works whose kinesthetic shifting and continuity form a prism through which dance mediates, complicates, and alters Taiwan’s developmentalist ethos, in a way that complicates readings of (self-)Orientalisms. Finally, the dissertation engages with the Yellow Butterfly Flying to the South Butoh Troupe led by Japanese butoh dancer Hata-Kanoko, who lived and worked in Taiwan for nearly a decade and whose works draw attention to the legacy of Japanese colonial modernity in Taiwan and East Asia. The troupe’s leftist and self-marginalizing politics in the legacy of Japanese postwar avant-garde performance produce alternative inter-Asian engagements. Enacting different ways of negotiating temporalities of modernity across space, these performances are counterpoints to one another on various levels. They also articulate ways of thinking, performing, and “moving” Taiwan transnationally: transnational Chineseness, self-conscious formations of “Asian” culture in opposition to an idea of the “West,” and inter-Asian relationships. Parsing out the complexity within the colossal designation of “transnationalism,” this project also proposes a concept of “contemporary dance” that moves beyond simple periodization or labeling of dance genres and styles and instead unpacks the temporal negotiations of moving bodies implicated in transnational relationships from differing and sometimes contradictory perspectives. Although seeking to transcend the periodization paradigm, my historicized case studies addressing the post-1980s conditions of Taiwan and globalized Chinese culture also index shifts from the end of the Cold War to globalization that affect cultural forms and their conditions of production and circulation.",1719261349,,Dissertations & Theses," Seetoo, Chia-YiSeetooChia-YiSeetoo, Chia-Yi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3827894781 , 99423612 , 66569 , 9781339019314 , 3720813 , 3720813", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781339019314, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1719261349?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0378 Dance , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0378 Dance , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0378 Dance , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0378 Dance , 0641 Performing Arts"," Asian Studies , Dance , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Butoh , China , Chineseness , Cloud Gate Dance Theatre , Contemporary dance , Legend Lin Dance Theatre , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Political+Kinesthetics+of+Contemporary+Dance%3A+Taiwan+in+Transnational+Perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Seetoo%2C+Chia-Yi&amp;isbn=9781339019314&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"669,"Three essays on economic development: International migration, social networks, and social capital","Three essays are included in this dissertation; each approaches development strategies with different research methods and data.

This thesis critically investigates the current form, content and function of inclusive policy and practice in the Greek educational system and wider social life, focusing predominantly on issues concerning disabled people. The thesis approaches inclusion as a contested concept, permeated by values and, thus, susceptible to a wide range of contextual meanings in the discourse of different social agents, involving endless disputes about its 'proper' meaning and uses. With this in mind, the study examines the discursive formulation of inclusion by three distinct social agents in the field of education: policy makers, disability theorists/activists and educationalists. By employing secondary research methods, including analysis of formal policy statements and literature review, and interviews, the thesis aims to expose the conflicting visions and contrasting agendas that exist under the outwardly unified banner of inclusion. The antinomies that underlie the making of inclusive schools and the intrinsic tensions within the conceptual framework of inclusion reveal a struggle between hegemonic and counter-hegemonic inclusion discourses. In contemporary educational and social policy, the humanitarian vocabulary of the inclusion movement has been colonised by dominant discourses of normalisation. As a result, the illusive concept of inclusion has been assimilated into governmental discourses and has become part of governance in an essentially unaltered exclusionary education system and society, rather than an emancipatory idea which opposes existing official models and prevailing policies of discrimination and exclusion. Hence, the struggle for the formulation of a truly inclusive social reality (in Greece and elsewhere) necessitates a shift of focus from moral imperatives onto the politics of disability, and from the unambiguous ideal of inclusion onto the material economic, political, social and cultural characteristics of the new world order to which the inclusion movement aspires.",1779551802,,Dissertations & Theses," Lianeri, IoannaLianeriIoannaLianeri, Ioanna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015177501 , 102698572 , 101309 , 10068077 , 10068077 , http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/20749/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779551802?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/20749/ , (UMI)AAI10068077 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Inclusive+education+in+greece%3A+official+policies%2C+alternative+discourses+and+the+antinomies+of+inclusion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lianeri%2C+Ioanna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"671,L' atelier del mondo: l'internazionale socialista e i'europa nel pensiero dei socialisti italiani e francesi (1945-1957),"The present work focuses on the reconstitution of the Socialist International (51) after the Second World War (1945-1962). It looks at three significant aspects of the history of socialism: the attempt to rebuild and reform a global organization; the issues and ideas that framed the new sphere of socialist politics; and the support given to European governmental initiatives. The approach taken is comparative (Italy and France); and t he attitudes of the socialists towards internationalism is examined in terms of both internal and external policy considerations. The convergence in some important respects of socialist culture with economic and political liberalism is examined, and particular attention is paid to the progressive decline in revolutionary militancy of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and to the increasing Europeanism of the French Social ist Party (SFIO). T he research is based on the examination of the records of internal debates and congresses and other documents kept at the Socialist International Archives (International Institute of Social history in Amsterdam). It also makes use of party and private papers held in the Lelio and Lisli Basso Foundation (Rome), and in the Guy Mollet Foundation (Paris). This thesis offers new insights into t he transnational links of the socialist parties and shows how the working class movements preferred to help maintain the integrity of the nation state rather than look to some form of global democratic government. •",1782839922,,Dissertations & Theses," Pugliese, EnricoPuglieseEnricoPugliese, Enrico",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3992930591 , 103112422 , 101309 , 10039148 , 10039148", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1782839922?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10039148 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=L%27+atelier+del+mondo%3A+l%27internazionale+socialista+e+i%27europa+nel+pensiero+dei+socialisti+italiani+e+francesi+%281945-1957%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pugliese%2C+Enrico&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"672,A corpus linguistic investigation into the media representation of the suffrage movement,"This thesis focuses on the representation of the women's suffrage movement in The Times newspaper between 1908 and 1914. I assemble two focused corpora from texts from News International's The Times Digital Archive: the 7 million word Suffrage corpus and the 400,000 word Letters to the Editor corpus. I then combine historical research into the suffrage movement, corpus linguistic analysis of social discourses and approaches drawn from critical discourse analysis. The suffrage movement was not a unified one; it was composed of various groups with differing backgrounds, ideologies and aims. Historians working with suffragist-produced texts have noted different terminology used to describe different factions of the movement. Less attention has been paid to how the suffrage movement was perceived by those outside the movement, and particularly how it was represented in the press. Central to this thesis is Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) argument that polyvocal, heterogeneous entities are simplified and erased by those in power. I demonstrate that such a simplification of diverse suffrage identities occurs on a lexical level through the consistent use of suffragist to describe all suffrage campaigners, including acts more commonly associated with suffragettes. This conflation of identities also occurred on a textual level through what I define as the 'suggestive placement' of texts within an article. I argue that suggestively placed prosuffrage texts offering a counter discourse are read in the context of the master narrative of suffrage campaigners as violent and dangerous. By focusing on a self-contained, historical movement this thesis is able to analyse changes in historical political discourses, offers corpus linguistic researchers working with contemporary social movements a point of comparison and proposes a methodology for working within the constraints of the data to get useful results.

International volunteering is part of an increasingly privatized, individualized model of development in which responsibility for resolving global inequalities is transferred from political institutions to private citizens. Thus, although individual volunteers act on a small scale, their encounters with local community members have high stakes. Despite the ubiquitous presence of international volunteers in developing nations, scholars have yet to critically examine their role in socioeconomic development. The scant existing literature seems to exempt volunteers from critique by situating them apart from their social and historical contexts--implying that volunteering is a ""pure"" humanitarian endeavor, removed from the political, economic, and social movements that have shaped contemporary development. In this dissertation, I will complicate this view and begin a critical conversation about the role of international volunteering within the broader field of development. Moreover, I will challenge dominant models of studying and understanding development by focusing on small-scale, individual encounters. I propose a corrective model for understanding contemporary relations of development through an ethnographic study of international volunteering that examines the encounters between the Malawian community members and the Western volunteers as a ""serious game."" I will describe and analyze encounters between Malawian community members and Western volunteers in order to understand the subjectivities that individuals bring to these encounters; the ways in which those subjectivities are enacted and interact in practice; and the implications of these encounters for the community and development. I will argue that the community-volunteer encounter is a crucial site for reproducing and challenging dominant discourses of place, morality, and development.",1497034473,,Dissertations & Theses," Bintrim, LisaBintrimLisaBintrim, Lisa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3215282891 , 85048302 , 66569 , 9781303677489 , 3609052 , 3609052", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303677489, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1497034473?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," African Studies , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , Development , Ethnography , International volunteers , Malawi , Subjectivity , Volunteering",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Playing+a+Serious+Game%3A+Encounters+Between+the+Local+Community+and+Western+Volunteers+in+Malawi&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bintrim%2C+Lisa&amp;isbn=9781303677489&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"674,"""A new way of doing politics"": The movement against cafta in Costa Rica","In October of 2007, Costa Ricans voted in a referendum to ratify a Free Trade Agreement with the United States (DR-CAFTA, or CAFTA). The first referendum in their nation's history--and the first referendum ever held on a Free Trade Agreement--marked the culmination of a cycle of contention over liberalization that transformed practices and expectations of politics in a country often considered an exemplar of representative democracy. In this dissertation I provide an account of the opposition to CAFTA (the NO), based on two years of ethnographic research with the Patriotic Committees (Comites Patrioticos), the decentralized, grassroots network at the heart of the movement against the treaty. I emphasize the contested meanings of democracy invoked in the struggle between the grassroots NO campaign and the transnational elite coalition that promoted the treaty (the SI). I argue that the opposition to CAFTA in Costa Rica was a movement to defend the “social state” (Estado social) against a globalizing neoliberal property regime, while challenging existing forms of political representation in the name of a more authentic popular democracy. I show how the struggle over CAFTA was shaped by an ongoing process of contention over liberalization and representation in the context of Costa Rica's particular social democratic institutions and traditions. I argue that, as the struggle evolved, the SI and the NO appealed to different aspects of the country's “institutionality” ( institucionalidad ), raising some fundamental contradictions within and between liberalism and democracy. One outcome was a controversial and ambiguous popular consultation, an exercise in “direct democracy” that paradoxically highlighted the limits of an elite-dominated political order. Drawing on theory and scholarship of populism and direct democracy, I show how protagonists of the NO turned a diversity of interests into unity of purpose, enabling them to nearly win a markedly asymmetrical contest. I also explain how the Patriotic Committees worked with established social idioms to pioneer new forms of political participation as they challenged the limits of existing representative institutions. I argue that in doing say they articulated a conception of democracy and social state that makes a distinctive contribution to discussions of post-neoliberalism.",1507462119,,Dissertations & Theses," Rayner, JeremyRaynerJeremyRayner, Jeremy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3246520431 , 86133072 , 66569 , 9781303738845 , 3612344 , 3612344", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303738845, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1507462119?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Geography , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Costa rica , Direct democracy , Free trade agreement , Latin america , Politics , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22A+new+way+of+doing+politics%22%3A+The+movement+against+cafta+in+Costa+Rica&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rayner%2C+Jeremy&amp;isbn=9781303738845&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"675,Making the case against GMOs: Issue adoption and adaptation by occupy activists,"The Occupy movement is one of several global justice social movements that have appeared around the world in recent years. Other prominent movements include the Arab Spring, the 15-M protest movement in Spain, and anti-austerity protests in Italy, Greece, and other parts of Europe. Although Occupy has many of the traditional components of social movements, it differs in that it is generally unwilling to focus on a single issue or to make specific demands. In addition, the many Occupy groups that have appeared worldwide do not represent a single culture and mission but rather are subject to local variation based on community-specific history, culture, and identity. Occupy groups identify a wide range of social, economic, and environmental issues of both local and global concern and make decisions about which issues to address and what actions to take at any specific point in time. This ethnographic case study examines the role of social representations (group values, beliefs, and descriptions) and political opportunity structure (historic, cultural, and political environment) in determining the focus of protest. Activism by Occupiers in Ventura County, California in opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) was studied to determine what factors contributed to the selection of this issue for protest over other recognized issues. The study finds that a combination of external stimuli, internal champions, evolving representations, and access to a protest target were significant in the choice of protest subjects. Internal dialogue within the group produced a concern over GMOs in the food supply that made activism in support of the global anti-GMO movement a perceived worthwhile activity for the group. The campaign to label GMOs in California made the issues related to GMOs publicly visible, and the physical presence of a Monsanto facility (a major manufacturer of GM seeds) provided a location for protest.",1513234949,,Dissertations & Theses," Long, Tracy NoraLongNoraTracyLong, Tracy Nora",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3267934051 , 86686032 , 66569 , 9781303786990 , 3614029 , 3614029", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303786990, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1513234949?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research"," Cultural anthropology , Social research"," Social sciences , Ethnographic case study , Genetically modified organisms , Gmos , Occupy movement , Political opportunity structure , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+the+case+against+GMOs%3A+Issue+adoption+and+adaptation+by+occupy+activists&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Long%2C+Tracy+Nora&amp;isbn=9781303786990&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"676,Learning Solidarity: Activist pedagogies and transnational knowledge production in Cuban and Iranian diasporic democracy movements,"This study critically examines the digital knowledge production of one Iranian and one Cuban diasporic social movement organization in transnational solidarity with democracy movements in Iran and Cuba respectively, with an eye to the (geo)politics of transnational knowledge production. Each organization's diagnostic and prognostic collective action frames are analyzed as sites of knowledge co-constructed by diasporic social movement actors with counterparts in the homeland country. I use qualitative content analysis of internet and social media texts (including websites, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter) to identify each organization's diagnostic and prognostic frames, as well as whether and how knowledge produced by homeland activists is deployed to construct these frames. Interviews with organization members elicit these activists' understanding of their role(s) as solidarity activists and their perceptions of the appropriate relationship between a solidarity movement in diaspora and the homeland movement(s) it endeavors to support. The effects of geopolitical power relations between homeland (Iranian/Cuban) and U.S.-based diaspora activists on the frames were analyzed using Kaplan and Grewal's Transnational Feminist Cultural Studies approach, which centers the (geo)politics of knowledge inherent in the relationship between homeland and diaspora activists. Based on the knowledge production practices observed in the case study organizations, I reframe the structure of transnational technologically-connected social movement networks as learning networks in which social movement actors learn, produce knowledge, and teach. I offer the term ""activist pedagogies"" to describe how social movement actors engage in these processes based on their self-perceived role in the social movement network(s) in which they are embedded, a role derived from their goals, audience, geopolitical context, and relationship to the movement with which they are in solidarity. I then propose a typology of four activist pedagogies, including how such pedagogies may be used to enact (or not) truly liberatory and critical teaching, learning, and knowledge production in transnational social movements.",1518537709,,Dissertations & Theses," McKibben, Susan ElizabethMcKibbenElizabethSusanMcKibben, Susan Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3283041851 , 87059592 , 66569 , 9781303789724 , 3614116 , 3614116", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303789724, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1518537709?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0456 Pedagogy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Educational sociology , Asian Studies , Pedagogy , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Education , Cuban americans , Diaspora , Iranian americans , Knowledge production , Learning networks , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learning+Solidarity%3A+Activist+pedagogies+and+transnational+knowledge+production+in+Cuban+and+Iranian+diasporic+democracy+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKibben%2C+Susan+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781303789724&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"677,"""Globalization from below""? Uncovering the nuances in grassroots/transnational mobilization","This thesis offers a micro-level analysis of labour and women’s organizing in the context of globalization through the case study of the Comité Fronterizo de Obrer@s (CFO) from 1978 to 2009. We will see how one organization’s journey can give us insights into the complexities of local organizing and transnational networking in the context of globalization. This case study can be seen as a lens through which we can examine the changing context of labour and women’s organizing in the distinct maquiladora environment. My work positions itself in the “globalization from above” and “globalization from below” debate, specifically around the question of transnational social movements that form the “globalization from below” category in the context of a political economy analysis. However, where my thesis differs from a more traditional analysis of the resistance to globalization, such as that found in the global justice movements or alter-globalization movements, is in its focus on the complexities of organizing at the local level and the pressures that these local organizations feel from “above” from their transnational partners. What this thesis adds to the literature are the stories from the actual members of the organization, about the structure, the decision-making process of their organization, the role of the leadership and the connections between the local organizing and the transnational civil society partners. The complex history of an organization that has been there since the beginning of the maquiladora industry allows us a better understanding of the changing conditions and struggles these workers have faced. This journey through the history of the CFO, the richness of this empirical data encompassing more than 30 years of organizing in the maquiladora zone of Northern Mexico also allows us to explore “globalization from below” through different lens. This thesis brings in a micro-detail analysis of a specific organization in a specific context where we can see clearly transnational civil society linkages and the impact of globalizing capitalist neoliberal economy. As such, this research can offer us new insights into the intricacies of local-global linkages and thus contribute to an area often neglected or underdeveloped in international relations (IR).",1522291783,,Dissertations & Theses," Hettiarachchi, CindyHettiarachchiCindyHettiarachchi, Cindy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3297200131 , 87378432 , 66569 , 9780499284914 , NS28491 , NS28491", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9780499284914, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1522291783?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Globalization , Globalization from below , Grassroots mobilization , Grassroots organizing , International relations , Local organizing , Local/global organizing , Micro-level analysis , Political economy , Transnational organizing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Globalization+from+below%22%3F+Uncovering+the+nuances+in+grassroots%2Ftransnational+mobilization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hettiarachchi%2C+Cindy&amp;isbn=9780499284914&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"678,"The international Christian embassy, Jerusalem and renewalist Zionism: Emerging Jewish-Christian ethnonationalism","This study names and examines the Renewalist (Pentecostal-charismatic-neocharismatic) strain of Christian Zionism using the International Christian Embassy, Jerusalem, as a primary lens into this global movement. The major finding in this dissertation is the contemporary emergence of a Jewish-Christian ethnonationalism, suggesting changes to the way nationalism is manifest in a global age, changes to certain segments of Christianity, and the emergence of a distinctive global political and religious culture centered around the existence of the state of Israel. Scholars of Christian Zionism have long associated the Christian Zionism with the 19th century, largely American theological movement known as premillennial dispensationalism. This association is erroneous in that it does not recognize earlier and different sources of Christian Zionism, nor does it recognize alternate, contemporary forms of the movement. Such undifferentiating associations have consequences for scholarly approaches to understandings related to the socio-political activities of Christian Zionism globally, the history of Christian Zionism, millennialist Christianity, and the Christian appropriation of the state of Israel and Jewish religion, culture, and even persons. Using the ICEJ as a primary example of Renewalist Zionism, this dissertation examines the ways this Christian Zionism manifests in other historical and contemporaneous forms of Renewalist Christianity. This work includes ethnography of the ICEJ's annual Feast of Tabernacles celebration held in Jerusalem, Israel and attended by thousands of Christians annually. A further ethnography of the ICEJ-USA's constructed pilgrimage and tour to Israel explores the expressions and practices of Renewalist Zionism on the ground in Israel. The ways that charismatic authority is constructed, the interplay of text, contemporary political realities, and Renewalist spirituality, and the role of global Christian media are also examined in detail. Furthermore, using the sociological theories of cultural globalization and social memory, Christian Zionism is theorized as a subjective ground for truth for its adherents in a relativizing, global age characterized by transnational flows and local, socio-political particularizations.",1525982004,,Dissertations & Theses," Westbrook, Matthew C.WestbrookC.MatthewWestbrook, Matthew C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3308285621 , 87700112 , 66569 , 9781303853524 , 3617679 , 3617679", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303853524, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1525982004?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0618 Comparative"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0618 Comparative"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0618 Comparative",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0618 Comparative"," Comparative literature , Middle Eastern Studies , Comparative"," Language, literature and linguistics , Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christian zionism , Dispensationalism , Ethnonationalism , Globalization , International christian embassy , Jerusalem , Pentecostalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+international+Christian+embassy%2C+Jerusalem+and+renewalist+Zionism%3A+Emerging+Jewish-Christian+ethnonationalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westbrook%2C+Matthew+C.&amp;isbn=9781303853524&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"679,Choreographing a New World: Katherine Dunham and the Politics of Dance,"This dissertation analyzes the intellectual and political contributions of choreographer Katherine Dunham (1909-2006). As an African American woman, Dunham broke several barriers of race and gender, first as an anthropologist conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the Caribbean in the 1930s, and second as the artistic director of a major dance company that toured the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia from the 1930s through the 1960s. She also wrote several scholarly books and articles, opened multiple schools, and served on the boards of numerous arts organizations. Although Dunham's contributions to anthropology and dance are vitally important, ""Choreographing a New World"" emphasizes her political engagement. Through actions both onstage and off, she helped strengthen the transnational ties of black social movements from the New Negro Movement to the Black Power Movement. In particular, the dissertation contends that Dunham made dance one of the primary forces in the creation and perpetuation of the African diaspora. She herself attempted to live diaspora by forging personal connections across racial, linguistic, national, class, and cultural borders. In order to shift the focus to Dunham's intellectual and political engagement, ""Choreographing a New World"" turns to previously untapped archival sources. This dissertation is the first scholarly work on Dunham to examine archives from the U.S. State Department, Office of Economic Opportunity, Bernard Berenson Papers, Rockefeller Foundation Records, Langston Hughes Papers, and Rosenwald Foundation Papers, among other archives. It combines insights from these archives with choreographic analysis, interviews with Dunham's former dancers and students, and embodied participant-observation research at the annual International Katherine Dunham Technique Seminars from 2010 to 2013. Overall, ""Choreographing a New World"" not only provides a new perspective on Dunham, but also raises important questions about dance as an intellectual and political activity, especially within an African diasporic context.",1525982090,,Dissertations & Theses," Das, Joanna DeeDasDeeJoannaDas, Joanna Dee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3308293081 , 87700812 , 66569 , 9781303851452 , 3617589 , 3617589", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303851452, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1525982090?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0378 Dance , 0578 History"," 0296 African American Studies , 0378 Dance , 0578 History"," 0296 African American Studies , 0378 Dance , 0578 History",," 0296 African American Studies , 0378 Dance , 0578 History"," African American Studies , Dance , History"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , African diaspora , Black dance , Dance , History , Katherine dunham , Performance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Choreographing+a+New+World%3A+Katherine+Dunham+and+the+Politics+of+Dance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Das%2C+Joanna+Dee&amp;isbn=9781303851452&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"680,New Rules for an Old Game: 350.org and Social Movements in the Digital Age,"Prominent research has been dedicated to the question of how digital communications influence society, particularly in the area of political and social movement effectiveness. Few studies have been able to assess the question from an analysis of digital media content and interviews with officials and supporters of a social movement. This study sought to understand how a social movement organization's goals and objectives shape and get shaped by digital communication. Also, it explored whether the use of digital communication influences an organization's ability to motivate and mobilize supporters. First, the study conducted an analysis of two years worth of digital content from an international environmental organization and a local affiliated organization. The content included webpage content, social media posts, and internal e-mails between supporters. Second, the study involved multiple interviews with 70 officials and supporters of the organization. The findings suggest that digital communications do have a significant influence on the operations of a social movement organization. They allow the creation of an entirely new form of social movement organization online, called ""wiki-movements."" These ""wiki-movements"" are movements where supporters have direct access to organizational officials and contribute to the organization in a method that suits their talents and tastes. Traditionally, social movement supporters have a limited number of options when they want to contribute to their cause, such as financial donations or volunteer work at a physical location. However, supporters of a ""wiki-movement"" could have direct access to the movement's founder or other high ranking officials frequently. Also, they have a greater range of options when they want to contribute to the cause, such as event formulation and execution or even the creation of a local chapter with its own unique identity.",1526020414,,Dissertations & Theses," Wright, PatrickWrightPatrickWright, Patrick",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3308582931 , 86273992 , 66569 , 9781303854064 , 3617714 , 3617714", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303854064, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1526020414?accountid=14496," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications",," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," Environmental Studies , Web Studies , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Health and environmental sciences , Digital communication , Environmentalism , Online content , Social media , Social movement success , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+Rules+for+an+Old+Game%3A+350.org+and+Social+Movements+in+the+Digital+Age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wright%2C+Patrick&amp;isbn=9781303854064&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"681,Places of sanctuary: Religious revivalism and the politics of immigration in New Mexico,"This dissertation examines the overlapping dimensions of secular and religious sanctuary place making by comparing the faith-based Sanctuary Movement(s) of the 1980s with the rise of present-day local immigration policy activism in New Mexico and beyond. Placing immigrant rights activism alongside religious revivalism, I also examine how the contemporary immigrant rights movement intersects with Renovación Carismática , a transnational Catholic charismatic renewal movement that originated in Chihuahua, México, and is growing in popularity among Mexican immigrants in northern New Mexico and many other states in the Southwestern vicinity. Mexican migrants' participation in both movements cultivates ""communities of protection"" that blur the lines between sacred and secular spaces, while also crossing ideological boundaries that separate legislating from evangelizing and legality from theology. Bringing different sites and configurations of sanctuary place making together in a historically contingent and comparative analysis, this research illuminates how new religious and political subjectivities are made in a changing post-migration landscape. This dissertation contributes to studies of immigration, religion, and social movements incorporating both historical and ethnographic methods and analysis of diverse sets of data including archival materials, oral history interviews, and contemporary ethnography. The first part of this dissertation is historical and traces the life of New Mexico's controversial sanctuary state declaration as a political theology that produced unexpected social and legal effects. I use the document to reconstruct a history of the sanctuary movement in the tri-state region and to narrate the events that led up to the dramatic 1988 Sanctuary Trial that defined the movement in New Mexico. Connecting the Sanctuary Movement(s) of the past with contemporary local immigration policy activism, the second part of this study focuses on the work of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, the leading immigrant rights organization in the state. Illuminating the interactivity between the immigrant rights movement and Renovación Carismática in the 2011 legislative battle over immigrant drivers' licenses, I show how the document became a ""vibrant object,"" that materialized immigrants' local citizenship and legitimacy of presence. Finally, I uncover the transborder mobilities and secular and religious innovations of the charismatic movement through the migration experiences of a family of talented lay preachers and musicians from Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua who brought borderlands charisma to Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Santa Fe and reignited the spirit of renewal.",1526488015,,Dissertations & Theses," Villarreal Garza, AmyVillarreal GarzaAmyVillarreal Garza, Amy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3310607921 , 87744022 , 66569 , 9781303842535 , 3617120 , 3617120", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303842535, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1526488015?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Ethnic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Immigration , Religion , Secularism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Places+of+sanctuary%3A+Religious+revivalism+and+the+politics+of+immigration+in+New+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Villarreal+Garza%2C+Amy&amp;isbn=9781303842535&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"682,"Baking ereba, expanding capabilities: A study of food, family &amp;amp; nation among the garifuna of honduras","My dissertation examines the way in which the poor and rural women of the matrifocal Garifuna community of Honduras are using the culinary tradition of making cassava bread (or ereba in the Garifuna language) to advance community development.

Guided by a Black feminist epistemology that seeks to capture voices that have been excluded and/or marginalized in mainstream Western discourse, and specifically in international relations (IR) and international development (ID), this dissertation proposes a transnational Black feminist (TBF) framework as an alternative to the race- and class-biased models of IR. Further, a multi-level capabilities approach that parallels the levels of analysis of the TBF framework is introduced. The multi-level capabilities approach extends capabilities beyond individuals to analyze families, nations, states and social movements.

In the 19th century unions emerged to fight against this social inequality and so became the defenders of the working class. Yet, after 150 years of such efforts, social inequality remains at an unprecedented high. This thesis seeks to explain exactly why unions were incapable of resolving this inequality, and thus why they failed to improve working class living conditions. Utilizing a historical material approach and employing a Marxist theory, this thesis explores the reasons for the unions' objective limitations. Through analyzing unions' origins, development and role in the fight for the emancipation of the working class, this thesis seeks first to present a theoretical understanding of the unions' purpose and their limitations. Second, guided by Marxist theory I detail one particular historical experience - the German union movement - and describe the movement's shift from a genuinely working class organization to an organization that fails to represent its constituents' interests. Lastly, I argue that the German case exemplifies a broader historical trend: union failure is not simply a European issue but an international one. In doing so, I argue that the unions' inherent nature and changing socio-economic environment engenders their failure, since the unions' work remains entrenched within the boundaries established by the capitalist system and their emergence in the framework of the national state and economy led to their complete deterioration in today's globalized system.",1535294811,,Dissertations & Theses," Rudolf, Jil PiaRudolfPiaJilRudolf, Jil Pia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3333331821 , 85970342 , 66569 , 9781303891502 , 1555830 , 1555830", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303891502, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535294811?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," European history , European Studies , International Relations , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unions%2C+socialism+and+the+working+class%3A+A+Marxist+analysis+of+German+Trade+Union+history&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rudolf%2C+Jil+Pia&amp;isbn=9781303891502&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"684,Sediqeh Dowlatabadi: An early twentieth century advocate of Iranian modernity (1882-1961 CE),"This dissertation provides an understanding of Sediqeh Dowlatabadi's notion of modernity and her contribution to the Iranian women's movement by an examination of her life and writings. In particular, the dissertation pays attention to her role as a newspaper publisher of Zaban-e Zanan ( Women's Tongue ) and director of the Kanun-e Banuvan (Women's Society.) Dowlatabadi's understanding of her social condition was based on the space she found herself within at different phases of her life; the concept of modernity she held in her youth, which was partially inhibited by societal expectations, was not the view of modernity she ascribed to in the later stages of her career and has become known for as a pioneer of Iranian women's rights. In Chapter Two, Dowlatabadi's formative environment and benefits from a politically and culturally fluid space because of her family's heterodox religious ties and participation in events leading up to and during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911 CE) are examined. In this environment Sediqeh received a strong education but continued to adhere to many common cultural practices. Thereafter, in Chapter Three, Dowlatabadi's actions and writings during the first run of her publication are examined. ""A Pitiful Story,"" which is a piece of Dowlatabadi's fiction from the period, is analyzed utilizing neo-historicist criticism. During this time period the public space allowed her to imagine a somewhat more liberal notion of modernity than many of her contemporaries. In Chapter Four, owlatabadi's support to go abroad and reasons for moving to an international space are considered. Her interactions with the international women's movement and the new space she found herself in are analyzed in Chapter Five; regardless, she remained true to her own Iranian-ness above all else. Finally, in Chapter Six, Dowlatabadi's return to Iran is deconstructed as is her behavior of working within the Pahlavi system to oppose it. Dowlatabadi made many unique contributions to the Iranian women's movement and the international women's movement. Dowlatabadi, in her role as an advocate of Iranian modernity, created a façade for herself as an ""every woman"" which other Iranian women could identify with and aspire to be.",1537432951,,Dissertations & Theses," Ellison-Speight, JulieEllison-SpeightJulieEllison-Speight, Julie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3339734651 , 86685942 , 66569 , 9781303895364 , 3619906 , 3619906", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303895364, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1537432951?accountid=14496," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Middle Eastern literature , Middle Eastern history , Middle Eastern Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Dowlatabadi , Kanun-e banuvan , Modernity , Sediqeh , Zaban-e zanan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sediqeh+Dowlatabadi%3A+An+early+twentieth+century+advocate+of+Iranian+modernity+%281882-1961+CE%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ellison-Speight%2C+Julie&amp;isbn=9781303895364&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"685,Popular Front Movements: Antifascism and the Makings of a Global Left during the Depression,"""Popular Front Movements"" is a transnational history of the Depression-era world's political economy. It takes, however, an unconventional approach to political economy, connecting popular politics—the everyday, local self-assertions of common people—to the world economy. To make sense of the global reach of fascism and antifascism during the Depression, I suggest that these two political forms worked as the popular politics of the global economic order. As a work of U.S. in the world history, this dissertation connects archivally-researched analysis of fascist and antifascist movements in U.S. cities such as New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis with archivally-researched analysis of counterpart movements in cities such as Paris, Pondicherry, Accra, and Saigon. From such a transnational perspective, one sees the makings of global fascism and antifascism out of the local social conflicts that poured out of these cities' factories, marketplaces, and streets during the Depression. This dissertation, then, offers a plebeian retelling of transnational intellectual exchange at a particularly cosmopolitan moment in U.S., and global, political thought. Indeed, I argue that the ideas that ultimately defined the global politics of the Depression era, those of fascism and antifascism, emanated not from international affairs of statecraft or transnational networks of intellectuals but rather from the practices of popular politics—from street fights and mass demonstrations to riots and sitdown strikes—performed by common people. I examine such practices to extract the often unspoken political ideas embedded within them, and then I trace the traffic of such practices, and the ideas smuggled within them, around the globe. ""Popular Front Movements"" claims that the antifascist left produced a moment of widespread social revolutionary possibility in 1936, one of the global ""moments of madness"" identified by political scientist Aristide Zolberg as endemic to modernity. This ephemeral flash of social revolution during the depths of the Depression witnessed common people who had endured years of everything gone wrong nonetheless act as if, as one participant aphorized, ""everything is possible."" Around this world turned upside down, ""popular front"" served as the moment's keyword. In France and Spain, the left confederated as the popular front and won elections; in the United States, the New Deal's re-election emboldened the left and was understood as the birth of an American popular front. ""Popular Front Movements,"" however, examines not the popular front's formal political triumphs but rather the popular politics that not only enabled electoral success but then also seized on the opportunities opened by it. Around the world, from Johannesburg to Harlem and from Havana to London, the popular front's repertoire of informal practices generated new political possibilities. In early 1936, the Chilean left united, citing the inspiration of popular fronts not only in France and Spain but also those in China, Brazil, Cuba, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador: across the mid-1930s, the left not only radicalized, it globalized. Indeed, by the end of 1936, transnational solidarities had forged a global left. The popular front's primary source of social revolutionary possibilities was the global sitdown strike movement of 1936. No previous history has grasped the global amplitude of the sitdown movement, which this dissertation details from its origin inside a Firestone rubber tire plant in Akron, Ohio, to such far-flung reaches as the Michelin rubber plantation at Ben Cui, Indochina. Along the way, I unearth evidence of sitdowns from Paris to Port-of-Spain on Trinidad, Algiers to Rio de Janeiro, Barcelona to Detroit. Furthermore, I argue that a cosmopolitan body of ideas, particularly tactics of nonviolence taken from contemporary India, informed the early sitdown strikes in Akron and the ensuing explosion of sitdowns across the United States. The U.S. sitdowns, in turn, served as blueprints for sitdowns in cities such as Kingston and Buenos Aires, The worldwide circulation of the sitdown tactic, seen as a working-class intellectual itinerary, exemplifies my claims of a common people's global exchange of practices and ideas. From such exchange, I argue, emerged a global left. As a work of U.S. in the world history, ""Popular Front Movements"" seeks to distinguish itself in two ways. First, by rooting its claims in the ideas produced by common people, it answers the field's growing concern about its tilt toward élite history and offers instead a methodology for the transnational history of ideas from below. Secondly, based on archival research in multiple countries and languages, it traces the transmission of political ideas across six continents to globalize its account of transnational exchange.",1540785815,,Dissertations & Theses," Fronczak, JosephFronczakJosephFronczak, Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3350467691 , 88675922 , 66569 , 9781321051124 , 3580689 , 3580689", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321051124, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1540785815?accountid=14496," 0578 History , 0615 Political science"," 0578 History , 0615 Political science"," 0578 History , 0615 Political science",," 0578 History , 0615 Political science"," History , Political science"," Social sciences , Antifascism , Fascism , Great Depression , International History , Social Movements , Transnational History",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Popular+Front+Movements%3A+Antifascism+and+the+Makings+of+a+Global+Left+during+the+Depression&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fronczak%2C+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781321051124&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"686,"Human liberation from below: Transnational origins of liberation theology, 1775-1975","This dissertation examines the transnational origins of what became a far-reaching theo-political movement and seeks to understand the cultural situation of its emergence. It sets the stage in the mid-1960s and the 1970s, as a group of religious intellectuals radicalized by the political and social crisis in the American hemisphere brought a new method and a critical stance to their discipline in what became known as liberation theology. They represented those socially, economically, and politically excluded within the liberal political project by race, class, or sex. Liberationists sought to bridge the perceived gulf between the professed religious values of freedom and justice, on the one hand, and political exigencies, on the other, and awaken the political power of religion for social change. In a time of cultural crisis, they redefined the meaning of Christian salvation and modern notions of freedom as an integral liberation. Combining social thought, theological antecedents, and the history and experience subordinated groups, liberationists challenged the political legitimating role of theology that dominated the mid-twentieth century. The study illuminates how, situated within their respective marginalized groups, liberationists confronted the cultural and political crisis sweeping the hemisphere. Liberationists addressed the long history of revolutionary and social scientific thought, and theology's negotiations with modernity. It argues that by turning toward culture and the history of oppressed people and by deploying social theory, liberationists constructed an ideational bridge between values rooted in divine transcendence, the classic purview of theology, and political arrangements of power. Liberationists strove to heal the modern breach between the expectation of a divinely heralded future of freedom and justice, and political reality. Asserting a more thorough relocation of divine transcendence to immanence in history and redefining salvation as actualized in this world, they awakened the theological urgency of the political sphere. In the wake of a faltering liberal theological consensus, they changed the theo-political discourse and set the stage for the subsequent torrent of religiously inspired political engagement in the late twentieth century.",1547939423,,Dissertations & Theses," Barger, Lilian CallesBargerCallesLilianBarger, Lilian Calles",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3382864051 , 89274412 , 66569 , 9781303948701 , 3622842 , 3622842", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303948701, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1547939423?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0325 Black studies , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0469 Theology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0325 Black studies , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0469 Theology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0325 Black studies , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0469 Theology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0318 Religion , 0325 Black studies , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0469 Theology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Religion , Black studies , American history , Womens studies , Theology , Latin American Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Black theology , Feminist theology , Intellectual history , Latin america , Liberation theology , Modernity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Human+liberation+from+below%3A+Transnational+origins+of+liberation+theology%2C+1775-1975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barger%2C+Lilian+Calles&amp;isbn=9781303948701&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"687,"""The path she had chosen"": Mobility in works by American women regionalists from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century","Mobility studies provides the lens through which this dissertation reexamines contemporary and historical critical assumptions about the genre of late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century regionalism. Scholars such as Hamlin Garland, Richard Brodhead, and Amy Kaplan argue that this literature idealizes backwards, homogeneous, and culturally sluggish spaces. Through the analysis of regional characters' mobility in works by Sarah Orne Jewett, Helen Hunt Jackson, Sarah Barnwell Elliott, and Sui Sin Far, I make three major claims that refute this critical history. First, I demonstrate how studying mobility in these texts illuminates the authors' interest in social reform. Critics such as Judith Fetterley and Marjorie Pryse argue that regionalist writing critiques social injustices by inviting privileged readers to sympathize with marginalized groups. Specifically, regional texts decrease the emotional distance between local subjects and readers by humanizing the former. Rather than reading regional figures as passive recipients of readers' pity, I argue that these characters deploy mobility to remove themselves from unjust situations, thus themselves becoming agents of social change. Additionally, I foreground how the characters' movements bring new cultures into towns, mobilize existing cultures, and destabilize geographic boundaries, thus making regional spaces more about progress and cultural fluidity than about demographic, spatial, and temporal fixity. Finally, my project builds on the concept of the global region, arguing that these writers use mobility to show how characters can simultaneously maintain local identities invested in reforming their communities while they evince an increasingly global worldview. ""The Path She Had Chosen"" first examines Sarah Orne Jewett's The Country of the Pointed Firs ; here I illustrate how the narrator's mobility bonds her with the local community. Continually altering her impression of the region, these social interactions establish Dunnet Landing as a heterogeneous space with permeable geographic boundaries. While Jewett's novel depicts how mobility unites communities, Helen Hunt Jackson's Ramona reveals how movement generates agency for marginalized groups. Ramona's many relocations call for Native sovereignty, while her eventual immigration to Mexico creates a transnational identity that resists regionalist literature's ostensible confinement of individuals within particular localities. Chapter four turns to Sarah Barnwell Elliott's The Durket Sperret, arguing that the heroine's movements throughout her Appalachian community undermine myths about the region's uniform poverty and instead expose a diverse class system that subverts critical assumptions about regionalist literature's tendency to champion cultural homogeneity and to secure economic and social boundaries. Finally, I demonstrate that Sui Sin Far's Mrs. Spring Fragrance further evidences how regionalism maps demographic heterogeneity and cultural multiplicity; the characters' localized movement creates complex cultural identities that a sinophobic America repudiated. All four writers reject assumptions about regionalist literature's emphasis on nostalgia, geographic fixity, and cultural authenticity, as they highlight how characters' mobility connects them with local cultures and concurrently enables them to become world citizens.",1553002160,,Dissertations & Theses," Wedehase, ErinWedehaseErinWedehase, Erin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3401616991 , 89704032 , 66569 , 9781303973987 , 3624239 , 3624239", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303973987, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1553002160?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0604 Regional Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0604 Regional Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0604 Regional Studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0604 Regional Studies"," Womens studies , American literature , Regional Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Local color , Mobility , Regionalism , Women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22The+path+she+had+chosen%22%3A+Mobility+in+works+by+American+women+regionalists+from+the+late+nineteenth+and+early+twentieth+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wedehase%2C+Erin&amp;isbn=9781303973987&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"688,The sociology of local food and transformational engagement: A case study of the rise of the local food movement,"This qualitative ethnographic case study of the local food movement in Larimer County, Colorado is an examination of the epistemological nature of how key players like chefs, farmers and local food advocates create and reinforce the local food movement. This thesis examines sociological process, and the micropolitics of the community of local food players, illustrating the progression of civic agriculture. I describe how transformative learning, or the process of changing a frame of reference, is key to understanding the capacity of local food movement actors to address complex systemic issues. The analysis reveals how three waves of new local hands-on projects created informal learning situations, increasing systemic and global knowledge of the food system, and how new social networks settings led to civic engagement. Cycles of accretionary knowledge and transformative learning indicate that the performative nature of civic engagement was key to the rise of the local food movement. This research offers guidance to professionals, academics and associations that represent local and regional food systems, in regards to the important role of learning sites and new social networks and that are necessary for personal transformational change and engagement. This study also lends empirical evidence that civic engagement necessitates systemic level thinking, which can inform future criteria and assessments of food movements. Overall, this research demonstrates a framework to analyze movement capacity via the waves of development, and offers a perspective on the rise of the local food movement that provides a more complete explanation of why and how food activism becomes a salient personal motivator that results in aspects of civic agriculture.",1553233388,,Dissertations & Theses," Ridenour, Laura M.RidenourM.LauraRidenour, Laura M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3402927361 , 89730892 , 66569 , 9781303976087 , 1558278 , 1558278", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303976087, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1553233388?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure",," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," Social research , Agricultural economics , Social structure"," Social sciences , Civic agriculture , Epistemology , Food movements , Local food , Sociology of knowledge , Transformative learning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sociology+of+local+food+and+transformational+engagement%3A+A+case+study+of+the+rise+of+the+local+food+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ridenour%2C+Laura+M.&amp;isbn=9781303976087&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"689,"INGOs, the global ideology of childhood and educational policy in Nepal","Over the last century, cultural ideas reflecting an ideal, normative childhood have become a major driving force shaping global policy related to children, particularly within the realm of education for development. A global consensus around these cultural ideas, referred to in this study as the global ideology of childhood, underscores the shared belief that all children are entitled to similar rights, protections, and childhood experiences. As societies around the world strive towards the realization of this ideal, a fundamental question remains: how is the global ideology of childhood reproduced in national contexts as transnational actors, and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in particular, develop and implement education practices and policies? Within the context of a global movement that emphasizes the needs and rights of individual children through the provision of quality education for all, this study utilizes a qualitative case study of Nepal’s National Framework of Child-friendly Schools for Quality Education to illustrate how INGOs and other policy actors reproduce and interpret global norms concerning children and childhood. The ultimate goal is to provide a richly descriptive account of how global culture is appropriated in one national context. Accordingly, three research questions ask: 1) how is the global ideology of childhood reflected in the policy?; 2) how do international, national, and local actors understand their roles in the development and implementation of the policy?; and 3) How do these actors envision the sustainability of the child-friendly school model in Nepal, and how might these global ideas be linked to broader social and cultural change? Drawing on interviews with multilevel actors, policy documents, and school observations, the findings provide evidence of the convergence between global and national conceptions of childhood; demonstrate that models of cultural reproduction must allow for the possibility of multi-directional patterns; and reveal the complexity of sustaining global ideas in local contexts while pointing to the rise in importance of the child in modern society. Ultimately, the research highlights how the child-friendly schools policy has created a space for education reform—and the realization of the rights of Nepali children—using language legitimated by a global consensus on childhood.",1553782685,,Dissertations & Theses," Henck, AdrienneHenckAdrienneHenck, Adrienne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3405757021 , 89798332 , 66569 , 9781321147940 , 3583364 , 3583364", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321147940, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1553782685?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0458 Education Policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0458 Education Policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0458 Education Policy , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0458 Education Policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Educational sociology , Education Policy , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Education , Child-friendly schools , Childhood , Education policy , International non-governmental organizations , Nepal , Quality education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=INGOs%2C+the+global+ideology+of+childhood+and+educational+policy+in+Nepal&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Henck%2C+Adrienne&amp;isbn=9781321147940&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"690,Human Rights and Grassroots Organizations: Localizing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Nicaragua,"The passage of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006 was hailed by the international disability rights movement as ""giving voice"" to millions of persons with disabilities around the world. The Convention institutionalizes a role for Disabled Persons Organizations (DPOs) in monitoring their rights. As such, international disability NGOs, networks, and funders have initiated capacity building projects that organize persons with disabilities for advocacy in local communities around the world. A central tension, however, has emerged. While the international disability movement is interested in mobilizing grassroots groups, it is also interested in ensuring that those DPOs reflect global priorities. As such, the international movement is engaged in promoting a very narrow organizational model that corresponds to membership-based, human rights advocacy that conflicts directly with the self-help, social support model that is the basis of many local disabled persons organziations, especially in the developing world. Using qualitative data drawn from fieldwork with grassroots disability associations in Northern Nicaragua, this article shows that international and national organizations have utilized a number of methods, including providing advocacy training, establishing new organizations, formalizing reporting procedures, to bring DPOs together around a human rights advocacy agenda. Program implementation, however, revealed a narrow concern with political empowerment that did not resonate with a local focus on addressing material needs and the instillation of a strict hierarchy and bureaucratic procedures that did not allow local DPOs to deviate from pre-determined, top-down agendas. This case study provides insight into the way global civil society legitimates itself through outreach directed at the grassroots, yet does not allow their full participation in interpreting and implementing their human rights. When local groups resist, it is understood as the result of a lack of consciousness or clear understanding rather than the strategic response of associations embedded in cooperative relationships and focused on addressing the material needs of their members.",1556551903,,Dissertations & Theses," Meyers, StephenMeyersStephenMeyers, Stephen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3414724631 , 89980932 , 66569 , 9781303996740 , 3625183 , 3625183", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303996740, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1556551903?accountid=14496, 0703 Organizational behavior, 0703 Organizational behavior, 0703 Organizational behavior,, 0703 Organizational behavior, Organizational behavior," Social sciences , Disability , Human rights , Transnational movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Human+Rights+and+Grassroots+Organizations%3A+Localizing+the+United+Nations+Convention+on+the+Rights+of+Persons+with+Disabilities+in+Nicaragua&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meyers%2C+Stephen&amp;isbn=9781303996740&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"691,Liquid Resistance: The Politics of Collaboration and Conflict in the UC and Occupy Movements,"My dissertation examines the movement to defend public education at the University of California; it explores the connections between the UC Movement and the Occupy Movement, as well as the relationship between these movements and global resistance struggles in the face of neoliberal policies and practices. The contemporary era, or what Bauman (2000) terms ""liquid modernity,"" is marked by the diffusion of power through globalization, the decline of the nation state, and the spread of market fundamentalism. Resistance is becoming more ""liquid"" as well; the boundaries between dispersed struggles have begun to erode, facilitated by the growth of decentralized, informal networks within and between movements. Analyses that examine any one manifestation of these struggles are increasingly insufficient. Scholars must develop new meso-level understandings of resistance that account for the complex connections between dispersed resistance struggles in the contemporary age. Based on more than two years experience as both an activist and ethnographer in the UC Movement and connected occupations, my research captures the diffuse, decentralized, and informal networks within and between the UC and Occupy Movements and the larger struggles in which they are embedded. A number of internal tensions emerged as participants in the UC and Occupy Movements strove to address the complex and diffuse nature of power and oppression in the liquid age. I identify four specific dimensions of struggle faced by participants: goals and grievances, organization and leadership, tactics, and identity work. Some participants pursued reform-oriented goals and expressed a preference for more structured and traditional forms of mobilization while others found reform inadequate and advocated revolutionary goals and more fluid and informal mobilization styles. These preferences were determined by a combination of micro and macro level factors including participants' different ideologies and understandings of democracy and social change, affinity groups and informal networks within the UC and Occupy Movements, and the relationship between these movements and the global resistance struggles of which they are a part. Through a grounded analysis of the complex mesostructure connecting these struggles, my research provides a window onto new challenges and opportunities faced by social movements in the age of liquid modernity.",1557709347,,Dissertations & Theses," Augusto, Sarah L.AugustoL.SarahAugusto, Sarah L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3415991411 , 90013612 , 66569 , 9781321013139 , 3626371 , 3626371", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321013139, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1557709347?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy,, 0630 Public policy, Public policy," Social sciences , Globalization , Neoliberalism , Resistance , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Liquid+Resistance%3A+The+Politics+of+Collaboration+and+Conflict+in+the+UC+and+Occupy+Movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Augusto%2C+Sarah+L.&amp;isbn=9781321013139&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"692,"The Asian Origins of Global Narcotics Control, c. 1860-1909","This dissertation traces the ferment of private ressentiment, public protest and political response to the Asian opium trade from the ""Second Opium War (1856-60) to the first, multilateral anti-drug summit in human history, the International Opium Commission in Shanghai (1909). Rather than isolating single anti-opium movements and drug control policies by administration, the focus is on moments and dynamics of ideological proliferation, social mobilization and political lobbying across the borders of societies in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Europe and North America. The locally diverse conditions of intersecting, transnational networks of social critique propelled anti-opium publicity to international prominence, fomenting international opposition as the cumulative product of cross-cultural cooperation. Co-emerging networks of social critique ranged from the first Indian efforts toward the protection and education of girls, European fears of human trafficking and the North American temperance agenda to late Qing national reformism. Buttressed by ideological alliances, attacks on opium regimes benefited from a broader footing than the assumption of isolated anti-opium activism suggests. On colonial, national and local levels, individual anti-opium movements owed their diversity and resilience to flexible combinations of a variety of causes, with each serving as a docking station for partner ideologies and alliances. The opium regimes under attack involved British, French and Dutch colonies across Asia as well as Qing China. Responding to the unprecedented interference of non-governmental actors and the ways they refashioned anti-opium interpretations, governments across Asia convened the International Opium Commission to agree on the principle of drug production for medical and scientific needs only, building the bedrock of all future initiatives to institutionalize global narcotics control in diplomacy and international law. The density of anti-opium initiatives that overlapped in space and time points to the fruitfulness of synthesizing the history of European, American and Japanese empires in Asia, of the first generations of Asian transnational activists, of the origins of transnational publicity in Asia, of the ideological roots of public health movements, of Asian national resistance and of cooperation in new domains of global governance, legitimated by the newly perceived priority of international public opinion.",1557746398,,Dissertations & Theses," Rimner, SteffenRimnerSteffenRimner, Steffen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3416063481 , 85786202 , 66569 , 9781321021820 , 3627071 , 3627071", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321021820, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1557746398?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0506 World History , 0601 International Relations"," 0332 History , 0506 World History , 0601 International Relations"," 0332 History , 0506 World History , 0601 International Relations",," 0332 History , 0506 World History , 0601 International Relations"," History , World History , International Relations"," Social sciences , Anti-opium movements , Asia , Imperialism , Opium trade , Public health , Social reforms , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Asian+Origins+of+Global+Narcotics+Control%2C+c.+1860-1909&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rimner%2C+Steffen&amp;isbn=9781321021820&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"693,"Victims of the Social Temperament: Prostitution, Migration and the Traffic in Women from Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, 1885-1935","The early twentieth century was the apogee of what historians have come to call a 'white slavery' panic, a period in which long term anxieties about the social dangers and moral ambiguities of sex work metamorphosed into an intense philanthropic, public and state focus on forced migration for the purposes of prostitution. This dissertation investigates the origins of 'the traffic in women' as a social problem in imperial Russian and Soviet law and society, connecting it to emergent regimes of transnational biopolitics at the fin-de-siècle and through the interwar years. This period was one in which state and social understandings of the subject's freedom, to move across borders or to consent to sex, were being reconceptualized. I argue that the traffic in women, as a legal category and cultural discourse, was key to this process of reconceptualization, as it became a heuristic for making sense of the entanglement of legality, clandestinity, consent and coercion operational in cross border migration, particularly that which involved sex work, in an age of rapid globalization. Consequently, this dissertation helps us to understand how certain conceptions of gendered and sexualized bodies have become central to questions of state security and sovereignty. Officials, activists and philanthropists in imperial Russia and the Soviet Union developed modes of dealing with this perceived crisis that combined rehabilitatory and carceral approaches to women who sold sex, as well as single female migrants. Through these modes of rule, governments and social activists could claim to be rescuing women by submitting them to increasingly interventionist and even violent state power. I argue that this mode of (authoritarian) governmentality was not a Russian 'special path' but stemmed from the interventionist logics of the international anti-trafficking movement itself, supposedly a paradigmatic liberal humanitarian cause. By making this point I do not argue that Russia was a liberal state but that liberalism was itself an incomplete project in the West, an observation borne out when we examine the emphasis the interwar League of Nations' 'Traffic in Women Committee' placed on the securitization of borders and deportation of foreign prostitutes. Ultimately, Russia's shared heritage of 'modern' state practices makes binary oppositions and claims of special paths of limited utility.",1558123277,,Dissertations & Theses," Hetherington, Philippa LesleyHetheringtonLesleyPhilippaHetherington, Philippa Lesley",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3416908791 , 90033172 , 66569 , 9781321017175 , 3626695 , 3626695", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321017175, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1558123277?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0630 Public policy , 0724 Russian history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0630 Public policy , 0724 Russian history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0630 Public policy , 0724 Russian history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history , 0630 Public policy , 0724 Russian history , 0733 Gender studies"," Womens studies , Modern history , Public policy , Russian history , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Gender , International migration , Russia , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Victims+of+the+Social+Temperament%3A+Prostitution%2C+Migration+and+the+Traffic+in+Women+from+Imperial+Russia+and+the+Soviet+Union%2C+1885-1935&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hetherington%2C+Philippa+Lesley&amp;isbn=9781321017175&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"694,"The development of the Russian counter-trafficking movement: The Angel Coalition and international politics on civil society, feminism, and human trafficking","In recent decades, transnational advocacy networks (TANs) for women's rights have become major players in the international arena, but have also struggled to maintain egalitarian and democratic practices within their ranks, as members from different world regions attempt to have their voices heard. In this dissertation, I question what strategies TANs can employ to more effectively and democratically push states for change on important social issues. To address this question, I carry out a case study of the development of the Russian movement against human trafficking from 1998 to 2008, with particular focus on the organization that served as leader of this movement, the Angel Coalition. To better understand the global forces that gave rise to this development, I examine two transnational movements that collided in Russia in the late 1990s: the contemporary transnational movement against human trafficking, and the movement by the United States and other Western governments to promote the growth of civil societies in developing and post-socialist countries as part of democracy aid programs. This dissertation contributes to transnational civil society theory and transnational feminist theory. The Angel Coalition, an organization run by activists from Russia, other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Western countries, and which received the majority of its funding from Western governments and foundations, overcame obstacles both to organizing across cultural and power differences and to influencing policy of the Russian Federation, a state known to reject the influence of foreign governments and foreign-funded civil society. I argue that two factors were especially important to the success of the Angel Coalition, as part of a transnational counter-trafficking network, in pushing the Russian state to take action against human trafficking: 1) counter-trafficking activists demonstrated a practiced understanding of the political environment of Russia; and 2) activists effectively communicated to the state how it would benefit from collaboration with civil society. Finally, I argue that organizational practices of the Angel Coalition, as a multinational NGO, facilitated its ability to implement these strategies. Most importantly, activists utilized their differences as resources and expressed respect for the unique contributions of all members of the coalition.",1558874319,,Dissertations & Theses," Shupiko, DeniseShupikoDeniseShupiko, Denise",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3419922601 , 90104682 , 66569 , 9781321030921 , 3627675 , 3627675", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321030921, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1558874319?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0614 Slavic Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0614 Slavic Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0614 Slavic Studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0614 Slavic Studies"," Womens studies , Slavic Studies"," Social sciences , Human trafficking , Russian civil society , Transnational feminist networks , Western aid for democratization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+development+of+the+Russian+counter-trafficking+movement%3A+The+Angel+Coalition+and+international+politics+on+civil+society%2C+feminism%2C+and+human+trafficking&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shupiko%2C+Denise&amp;isbn=9781321030921&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"695,Social movement organizations in the local food movement: Linking social capital and movement support,"Social movement actors seeking alternatives to the highly industrialized, global food system have been advocating for more sustainable, local food systems. Many of the local food movement strategies and initiatives to counter the conventional practices of the industrial food system have proven successful. Social movement researchers have documented the importance of the roles and services social movement organizations provide for movement constituents to realize their success, emphasizing human and financial capital as key components for mobilizing collective action. Researchers have also documented the value of interorganizational networks, and the benefits of collaboration to expand the share of resources, and perhaps more importantly design social movement frames to direct collective action for social change. However, what local food movement research has yet to address are some of the potential barriers that minimize collaboration among organizational leaders as it relates to social capital and collective identity. This dissertation takes a cross-sectional, network analysis of social movement organizations working to increase the sustainability of the local food system in Marin County, California, a historically agricultural region serving a number of urban communities. Findings from the mixed-methods research reveal evidence of collective identity and social capital as enhancing collaboration among particular types of organizations while reducing potential collaboration among and between other social movement organizations. By analyzing the collective identity and dichotomous nature of social capital among social movement organizations, this research contributes a clearer understanding of the existing gaps for realizing a more sustainable local food system.",1558874583,,Dissertations & Theses," Bauermeister, Mark RichardBauermeisterRichardMarkBauermeister, Mark Richard",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3419918011 , 90103482 , 66569 , 9781321025330 , 3627362 , 3627362", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321025330, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1558874583?accountid=14496," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Environmental management , Sustainability , Social structure , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , California , Collective action , Collective identity , Local food movement , Social capital , Social networks , Sustainable local food system",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+movement+organizations+in+the+local+food+movement%3A+Linking+social+capital+and%0Amovement+support&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bauermeister%2C+Mark+Richard&amp;isbn=9781321025330&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"696,"Metrics &amp;amp; Democratization: Law, Technology &amp;amp; Democratic Expertise in Postwar El Salvador","The dissertation is an ethnographic study of the role of monitoring standards on democratic governance reform in El Salvador since the 1992 end of a 12-year civil war. The study looks at the development and implementation of monitoring and evaluation models for rule of law, citizen participation and accountability reforms, in order to understand the impact of standards on the local adaptation and global circulation of democratic reform programs. Through practices of standardization, law and technology together construct the expertise that democratic institutions increasingly require for political participation. The legacy of democratic reform in El Salvador is particularly important because the country served as a laboratory and poster-child for democratization models most recently applied to U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In-depth qualitative study of the development and use of monitoring standards reveals a formalization of ways of producing and contesting knowledge deemed crucial for political communities – be they rural hamlets or national economic sectors. As with any institutional form, certain political possibilities are enabled while others are marginalized or constrained. However, beside the establishment of dominant frameworks for knowing about social realities and participating in decision-making governing those realities, monitoring standards provide means for the mobilization and advocacy of alternative perspectives and agendas. The dissertation presents a historical account of the institutionalization of monitoring standards that have become typical components of what international agencies promote as democratic governance. Ethnographic accounts of how these standards circulate and are used by governments, NGOs, citizens and social movements illustrate their ubiquity, flexibility and dynamism – from municipal finance and state decentralization, to human rights struggles over water privatization, mining, crime and pharmaceuticals. Research conducted before, during and after the 2009 election of the leftist FMLN party to the presidency captures shifts in the use of monitoring standards as social movement activists move into government.",1562229088,,Dissertations & Theses," Cross, Jason MarcCrossMarcJasonCross, Jason Marc",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3433355751 , 87733612 , 66569 , 9781321065213 , 3629503 , 3629503", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321065213, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562229088?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0617 Public administration"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0617 Public administration"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0617 Public administration",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0398 Law , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0617 Public administration"," Cultural anthropology , Law , Latin American Studies , Public administration"," Social sciences , Democracy , El salvador , Law , Metrics , Politics , Technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Metrics+%26amp%3B+Democratization%3A+Law%2C+Technology+%26amp%3B+Democratic+Expertise+in+Postwar+El+Salvador&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cross%2C+Jason+Marc&amp;isbn=9781321065213&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"697,"The politics of make/believe: Locating the intersections of contempoary anarchism, indigenous decolonization and women of color feminisms","Entitled The Politics of Make/Believe: Locating the Intersection of Contemporary Anarchism, Indigenous Decolonization, and Women of Color Feminisms, this project interrogates the intersections of contemporary anarchist, feminist, and indigenous theories and movements. Scholars and activists concerned with the challenges of building resistance movements in a transnational world have become increasingly interested in anarchism because it has been a core political current of the global justice movement and media fascination since the 1990s and continuing to the contemporary moment with Occupy Wall Street. Many argue that, because of its foundations in horizontal movement building, consensus based decision-making, and an opposition to all forms of hierarchy, there exists a natural affinity between anarchism and anti-racist, feminist, and decolonizing movements that can be re-imagined and implemented on a global scale. However, I argue that, despite these potential affinities, contemporary anarchist scholars have been unsuccessful at developing an anarchist praxis that is capable of attending to questions of race, gender, and settler colonialism in the global context as well as within anarchist movements themselves. By analyzing texts by anarchist scholars and activists, I demonstrate that the intersections of contemporary anarchism, indigenous decolonization, and women of color feminisms often arise at moments of antagonism rather than affinity. I explore how contemporary anarchists depend on rhetoric that reproduces American exceptionalism, sexual violence, and settler colonialism within anarchist spaces, making these structures legible within radical discourse itself. I end by suggesting that the location of intersection between contemporary anarchism, indigenous decolonization, and women of color feminisms not in identical analyses of domination but rather in the vision for political praxis expressed in each. Drawing on literary works by authors such as Audre Lorde, Emma Pérez, Leslie Marmon Silko, Joy Harjo, Deborah Miranda, Toni Cade Bambara, Ruth Ozeki, and Gail Tremblay, I emphasize the predominance of a 'politics of make/believe' within women of color feminisms, indigenous decolonization movements, and contemporary anarchism. Grounded in an interdisciplinary methodology, this project employs a transnational approach to the study of contemporary radical social movements in order to imagine a global justice movement that is capable of being broadly applicable while still able to attend to dynamics of difference and specificity. Underscoring the indelible connection between imagining alternative futures and bringing those futures into being in the present, The Politics of Make/Believe demonstrates how attention to praxis can reorient our understanding of the relationship between radical social movements and the possibilities they present to and for each other.",1562520118,,Dissertations & Theses," Warburton, Theresa AnneWarburtonAnneTheresaWarburton, Theresa Anne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3434693621 , 90411742 , 66569 , 9781321072846 , 3629874 , 3629874", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321072846, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562520118?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Modern literature , Womens studies , Gender studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Anarchism , Decolonization , Feminism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+make%2Fbelieve%3A+Locating+the+intersections+of+contempoary+anarchism%2C+indigenous+decolonization+and+women+of+color+feminisms&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Warburton%2C+Theresa+Anne&amp;isbn=9781321072846&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"698,The Reproductive Lives of Chuukese Women: Transnationalism in Guam and Chuuk,"Chuuk, one state of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), experiences significant transnational migration to the United States (U.S.), particularly to the Territory of Guam. This migration is facilitated by the Compact of Free Association (COFA), an agreement with several Micronesian countries previously under U.S. administration that allows for free movement of their citizens into the U.S. Although part of Micronesia, Guam's colonized residents resist an identity connected to rest of Micronesia. With very poor health outcomes, the Chuukese represent a political and social body of bodies that bring sickness, babies and increased costs to the Guam government without adequate compensation by their colonizer sanctioning the migration. In order to better understand why Chuukese women suffer disproportionately poor reproductive health outcomes as compared to the rest of Guam's residents, this multi-sited dissertation examines how Chuukese women's reproduction is constructed and conceptualized by women, their families, and their ""home"" and ""host"" communities, and how these meanings are mediated by transnational migrant experiences between Chuuk and Guam. Using a critical interpretive framework, this study utilized participant observation in the clinics and communities, interviews with health care workers, and in-depth life history interviews with fifteen Chuukese women. This dissertation situates Chuukese women's reproduction in the context of transnational migration through an analysis of social, economic and political processes, health and social services policies and practices, postcolonial migration and sociocultural meanings of reproduction for Chuukese women in both Chuuk and Guam.",1562947242,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Sarah A.SmithA.SarahSmith, Sarah A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3435836641 , 87737982 , 66569 , 9781321075403 , 3629977 , 3629977", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321075403, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562947242?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Public health , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Applied medical anthropology , Gender and migration , Micronesia , Sexual and reproductive health",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Reproductive+Lives+of+Chuukese+Women%3A+Transnationalism+in+Guam+and+Chuuk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Sarah+A.&amp;isbn=9781321075403&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"699,"Global supply chains of desires and risks: The crafting of migrant entrepreneurship in Guangzhou, China","This dissertation examines how rural migrants' experiments with small-scale entrepreneurship serve as the intermediary links through which global commodity chains for fast fashion are anchored in post-socialist China. While anthropologists of transnational capitalism have examined the diversity through which market participants determine the movement of labor and capital across vast geographic distances around the globe, their works tend to rely on the stability of categories of people, objects, and practices. They overlook the ways in which people's identities shift and move within ongoing conditions of ambivalence and uncertainty. Based on 22 months of fieldwork in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, this dissertation underscores the shifting qualities of experiences among migrant entrepreneurs as they craft the transnational links of commodity production and exchange. I show how the global commodity chains for fast fashion link and de-link through the building and destruction of social spaces, through the production and challenges to social subjectivity, and through the intensification of gender and class-based inequalities. Drawing on participant observation and interviews with intermediary traders, migrant factory owners, and wage workers, this project asks: how do migrants in China negotiate the paradoxes of entrepreneurial freedom as they work through the political implications and affective dimensions of becoming entrepreneurial citizens?",1564215246,,Dissertations & Theses," Chu, NellieChuNellieChu, Nellie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3439887371 , 87744022 , 66569 , 9781321087123 , 3630664 , 3630664", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321087123, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564215246?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Capitalist desires and risks , Gendered factory labor , Global commodity chains , Postsocialism , Transnational capitalism , Urbanization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+supply+chains+of+desires+and+risks%3A+The+crafting+of+migrant+entrepreneurship+in+Guangzhou%2C+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chu%2C+Nellie&amp;isbn=9781321087123&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"700,"The semiotics of revivalist Islam: Women, space, and stories in Pakistan's islamic movements","Large numbers of urban Pakistani women are adopting sartorial and behavioral markers associated with the global Islamic revival and are participating in Islamic revivalist movements. Many Pakistanis find this increase troubling, and feel that it betokens an increase in ""extremism"" in Pakistan. Women's participation in these movements is controversial, and results in conflicts with their families, friends, and social networks. As they participate in revivalist movements, women are introduced to Islamic sacred texts (the Qur'an and Hadith), which movement leadership interpret in ways that support the reformist mission of their particular movement. Revivalist leaders draw on Islamic sacred texts to promote visions of a pure Islamic society, and call on women to restrict their spending and socialization habits, and to reject many aspects of Pakistani society as ""un-Islamic."" This dissertation examines women's participation in Islamic revivalism in Pakistan through a focus on women's participation in the Tablighi Jama'at and the Al-Huda Welfare Trust. The relative gendered composition of these movements makes a comparative approach particularly instructive; the Tablighi Jama'at is a male-led movement which incorporates women as accessories, while Al-Huda is female-led and was founded exclusively for women. These movements, and Pakistani reactions to them, illustrate Pakistani beliefs regarding gender, purified religion, and ideas of culture. A study of these movements speaks to theoretical concerns regarding the Islamic revival as a global movement, and to the role of the religious resurgence in Pakistan. I explore these movements through the following guiding questions: (1) Are women's experiences in women-led movements different from those that are strongly male-centered?; (2) how do the differences among revivalist movements impact women's learning experience and utilization of sacred texts within and outside revivalist settings?; (3) to what extent do women contribute to the revivalist theology and ideology that guides their lives? Is this process different based on the movement a woman joins?; and (4) how does revivalism impact the social landscape of urban Pakistan? Two unifying analytical themes run through this dissertation and provide a framework through which I answer my research questions. The first is an examination of the contestations and discourses surrounding gendered piety, and the ways in which these confrontations delineate the urban Pakistani discursive field. The second theme concerns meaning-making within the Tablighi Jama'at and Al-Huda, and interrogates the processes through which revivalist knowledges are created and maintained. My dissertation traces the processes through which revivalist subjects emerge, with a focus on the ways in which revivalist women contribute to the discourses which form their subjecthood and subjectivities. I argue that women's agency is not limited to their self-creation as subjects, but extends to their participation in the creation of the discourses to which they subject themselves. My research reveals that female members of the Tablighi Jama'at and Al-Huda create movement structures and messages through their participation in these movements, actively contributing to revivalist ideology and meaning. The mechanisms of women's contributions are similar across movements, and women in both movements contribute significantly to the revivalist discourse, rhetoric, and theology they adopt.",1564227997,,Dissertations & Theses," Zaman, Meryem FatimaZamanFatimaMeryemZaman, Meryem Fatima",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3440018621 , 87773542 , 66569 , 9781321092790 , 3631026 , 3631026", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321092790, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564227997?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Gender studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Gender , Islam , Pakistan , Revivalism , Social class",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+semiotics+of+revivalist+Islam%3A+Women%2C+space%2C+and+stories+in+Pakistan%27s+islamic+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zaman%2C+Meryem+Fatima&amp;isbn=9781321092790&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"701,Contentious Subjects: Non/violence as Topic and Trope in the Occupy Movement,"Why was there such heated disagreement within the Occupy movement around the word nonviolence, and why was this disagreement so generationally marked? Why were the social movements in the 2011 global wave of unrest so suddenly disruptive, even violent, almost always involving riots? What does this have to teach us about the rhetorical power of embodied, contentious rhetorics, and what does it tell us about the characteristics of movements to come? Social movements are faced with exigencies under neoliberalism to which they often respond differently than the large-scale demonstrations of previous eras: a) protesting counterpublics often make their appeals immediately and intensively rather than extensively through mass media, b) challenging the status quo more in terms of power (in its aspects of agency, capacity, and possibility) than in claims of justice, and c) often do so in part by performing antagonism with existing institutions of enforcement: namely, police. Nonviolence discourse is inconsistent with the rhetorical strategies best suited to these conditions, although in its ""strategic"" rather than ""principled"" variants, it shares more in common with them than is usually thought: strategies, social processes enacted, goals, and the aversion to inflicting injury to bodies. Rioting has proved central to recent movements because it is exemplary (though not exclusive) of how such strategies are enacted, and bears out in condensed form their logic: necessarily embodied and risky in the discursive action of transgressing previous semiotic systems, articulating new contentious subjects through physically confronting old foci of power. Like the more confrontational aspects of the Occupy movement, future movements are likely to perform power in similar ways, fostering a complementarity of diverse, innovative approaches, broaching semiotic expectations, and not relying on the categories of victimhood and innocence which have proven central to previous generations of social movement rhetoric.",1608992116,,Dissertations & Theses," Meckfessel, ShonMeckfesselShonMeckfessel, Shon",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3453827091 , 90699362 , 66569 , 9781321110173 , 3631910 , 3631910", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321110173, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1608992116?accountid=14496, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric,, 0681 Rhetoric, Rhetoric," Language, literature and linguistics , Disruption , Neoliberalism , Nonviolence , Occupy , Riots , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contentious+Subjects%3A+Non%2Fviolence+as+Topic+and+Trope+in+the+Occupy+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meckfessel%2C+Shon&amp;isbn=9781321110173&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"702,"A Tale of Two Movements? Gay Liberation and the Left in West Germany, 1969-1989","A Tale of Two Movements focuses on the Schwulenbewegung (gay liberation movement) in the Federal Republic of Germany between 1969 and 1989. The movement has been characterized by both activists and critics as bitterly divided between so called radicals who desired to join a larger social revolution against capitalism and integrationists who sought reforms through the existing system as an oppressed minority group. Similar critiques are sometimes applied to the New Left in general which is frequently presented as a collection of divided social movements separated by identities, ideologies and time period. This project does not dispute that activists within the Schwulenbewegung were internally divided over certain issues; however, it does complicate this existing interpretation by discussing the social scientific, political, and gender-based theories that both influenced and challenged the movement alongside the history of its development. When viewed within the larger context of cultural, temporal and transnational developments, such divisions seem less significant than when interpreted through a strictly state-centered or organization-based narrative. The contention here is that the Schwulenbewegung was in a process of developing an ideological framework and was neither completely radical nor integrative. Instead, the movement's theoretical orientation was always undergoing a dialectical process concerning identity and collective struggle. More importantly, the Schwulenbewegung can be viewed as sharing a common space with not only New Left groups, but earlier homosexual advocacy movements as well.",1609015789,,Dissertations & Theses," Van Cleef, RonaldVan CleefRonaldVan Cleef, Ronald",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3453976801 , 90853522 , 66569 , 9781321125306 , 3633063 , 3633063", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321125306, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1609015789?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0335 European history , 0440 European Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," European history , European Studies , GLBT Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Gay , Germany , Liberation , Schwulenbewegung",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Tale+of+Two+Movements%3F+Gay+Liberation+and+the+Left+in+West+Germany%2C+1969-1989&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+Cleef%2C+Ronald&amp;isbn=9781321125306&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"703,"Making nations, in the &lt;i&gt;mahjar:&lt;/i&gt; Syrian and Lebanese long-distance nationalisms in New York City, São Paulo, and Buenos Aires, 1913-1929","This dissertation traces the emergence of transnational political institutions among Arabophone Ottoman emigrants living in New York City, São Paulo, and Buenos Aires, and analyzes the development of a long-distance nationalist politics among emigrant activists during and after World War I. Using socially-produced primary materials written and circulated by Syrian and Lebanese emigrants themselves, this research argues that emigrants living abroad played fundamental roles in the nascence of competing Arab, Syrian, and Lebanese nationalist movements. From the Americas, these activists were the first to envision a post-Ottoman political future for the homeland which placed Syria (or Lebanon, established in 1920) within the international community of nation states. The pursuit of nation-building led many of these activists to pursue partnership with the Entente Powers, particularly France and the United States of America. The partnerships formed between Syrian emigrants and the Great Powers influenced the politics of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and helped to usher in the French Mandate declared over Syria and Lebanon in 1920. But as the French instituted an increasingly imperialistic state over the Levant, sizable emigrant communities in the Americas presented a constant source of dissent, agitation against French rule, and support for an increasingly radical nationalist movement. By tracing nationalist politics and activism across transnational space, this study labors towards a needed reframing of modern Syrian and Lebanese history within the social networks and human geographies of individuals, rather than the territorial confines of the nation-state.",1609374176,,Dissertations & Theses," Fahrenthold, Stacy D.FahrentholdD.StacyFahrenthold, Stacy D.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3456043621 , 90900562 , 66569 , 9781321298536 , 3642744 , 3642744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321298536, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1609374176?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0578 History"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0578 History"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0578 History",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0578 History"," Middle Eastern history , Middle Eastern Studies , History"," Social sciences , Diaspora , Emigration , Lebanon , Mahjar , Syria",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+nations%2C+in+the+mahjar%3A+Syrian+and%0ALebanese+long-distance+nationalisms+in+New+York+City%2C+S%C3%A3o+Paulo%2C+and+Buenos+Aires%2C+1913-1929&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fahrenthold%2C+Stacy+D.&amp;isbn=9781321298536&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"704,Impacts of expatriates' international experience on self-identity,"Expatriation is becoming an attractive career path for many people due to the global economic movement. People experience career transitions due to change of organization, locations, responsibilities, reporting structures, and work groups. Expatriates in particular experience more extreme changes because of challenges they encounter from language differences, geographical distance across countries, culture, habit, and life style. These changes influence people's perspective in seeing things, including their self-identity. The aim of this research was to explore the evolvement of expatriates' self-identity. A qualitative research design using reflexive narrative inquiry was employed. Seven current and former expatriates from Australia, Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States participated in this study. Through an interview process, these individuals reflected upon and shared their international experience retrospectively. Using expatriates' own narrative, an individual identity transformation story was constructed in order to answer the research question of this study: How does international experience influence a person's self-identity? Participants noticed significant and previously unknown changes in their behavior and outlook from their assignments. These varied based upon their motives for accepting the assignment, social interaction, work requirements, and personal attitudes. The study reveals that international assignments help expatriates discover the identity that they may not have recognized previously, and affirms and transitions their already known identity to a different level through new learning and relationships from their experiences. Expatriates' enjoyment of their experience is highly influenced by their social interaction and dialogue with others. One of the drawbacks from expatriation, especially for those who are on long-term international assignments and deep immersion in the local culture, is the losing of their definition of home. As a result of this study, recommendations include an opportunity for organizations to conduct a fit-gap analysis with employees. Results can provide information on employees' level of readiness to take on an international role, and for organizations to better support employees' preparation needs. Onsite coaching and support groups for expatriates can be beneficial to alleviate the stress that occurred during their on-boarding. In addition, expatriates are encouraged to establish their social network in the host country.",1615085760,,Dissertations & Theses," Chan, Mandy M.ChanM.MandyChan, Mandy M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3468176521 , 90287412 , 66569 , 9781321165678 , 3635480 , 3635480", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321165678, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615085760?accountid=14496," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0454 Management , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Behavioral psychology , Management , Occupational psychology , Personality psychology , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Psychology , Culture , Expatriates , Identity , International assignment , Self-understanding",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Impacts+of+expatriates%27+international+experience+on+self-identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chan%2C+Mandy+M.&amp;isbn=9781321165678&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"705,An analysis of the global mobilization hyperlink network for vulnerable islands,"Mobilization is the movement and synchronization of ideas, people or resources for a specific social goal. As a collective phenomenon, mobilization requires communication and social interaction in order to occur and potentially to be effective. Organizations that mobilize on behalf of a cause can be viewed in network terms as nodes connected by hyperlinks. This characterization allows for an examination of how central or influential organizations are to a mobilization network, and which organizations are most essential to the continued existence of a network. This dissertation integrates mobilization theory with theory and methods of social network analysis to provide a case study of an international mobilization network devoted to Small Island Developing States (SIDS). SIDS are island nations particularly vulnerable to global climate change, and in particular, to rising ocean levels that threaten their water supplies, food sources, community structure, and traditional way of life. Through an analysis of hyperlinks serving as connections among the labyrinth of organizations working with SIDS, this dissertation has two specific goals: first, to better understand the structural dynamics of the global SIDS network, and second to identify the most active and influential groups within the mobilization effort.",1615093777,,Dissertations & Theses," Fernandez, LaleahFernandezLaleahFernandez, Laleah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3468217871 , 91063912 , 66569 , 9781321221664 , 3638508 , 3638508", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321221664, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615093777?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0459 Communication , 0489 Information Technology , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0404 Climate Change , 0459 Communication , 0489 Information Technology , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0404 Climate Change , 0459 Communication , 0489 Information Technology , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0404 Climate Change , 0459 Communication , 0489 Information Technology , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Climate Change , Communication , Information Technology , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Earth sciences , Climate , Hyperlinks , International , Mobilization , Network , Vulnerable populations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+the+global+mobilization+hyperlink+network+for+vulnerable+islands&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fernandez%2C+Laleah&amp;isbn=9781321221664&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"706,A rhetorical history of 350.org's international day of climate action,"Chapter 1, ""Introduction: Wait 'til It's Bad"" introduces my dissertation as a scenic, rather than narrative, rhetorical history answering Marlia Banning's call for a way to respond to public doubts about climate change science. I explain how Burke's dramatistic theory of human motives provides a framework for my construction of three scenes of debate about the environment. I explain how Burke's theory of terminological screens provides a sensitive heuristic for analysis of the vocabulary used by Bill McKibben's group 350.org to persuade digital and embodied publics of the need to reduce carbon emissions. In chapter two, ""Choosing Terminology in the Global Warming Drama,"" I provide a close reading of selected documents in scenes of pro- and anti-environmentalism in the decades before the International Day of Climate Action, an embodied and digital event organized by 350.org to influence decisions at the 2009 United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change. I analyzed the potential of vocabulary to motivate and de-motivate environmental activism. In chapter three, ""Bill McKibben and 350.org: Circumferences and Reductions in the Rhetoric of a Social Movement,"" I argued that contracting and expanding terminological circumferences first establish and then limit the scope of 350.org's influence.

In chapter four, ""Overcoming Trained Incapacity,"" I created a new way of seeing the connection between Burke's concepts of the rottenness of perfection, trained incapacity, and piety by demonstrating how individuals acquire a vocabulary to express their worldview and subsequently rehearse and reiterate that worldview into a perfectly rigid set of beliefs capable of blinding the individual to other views.

There has been research done on Filipinos in the arts and social movements, however there is a paucity of information concerning Filipino cultural work. Cultural work and cultural workers are intentional in creating culture as an act of resistance to imperialism, as of the stories they tell though their creative work are not revealed much in mainstream media. Cultural workers also seek to debunk the myth of artists working in isolation from the community. As shared by the participants in this study, cultural workers are more importantly organizers working closely with marginalized communities, and in many ways are ""popular educators"" and ""organic intellectuals."" The purpose of this study is twofold: to examine the extent to which cultural work brings political consciousness to marginalized populations in the Philippines and the U.S. who do not have access to education, and to examine the impact of cultural work locally and transnationally as a tool for social change and addressing issues that impact marginalized populations, particularly in the National Democratic Movement of the Philippines. The qualitative methodology used for this study is narrative research, gathering the stories of Filipino cultural workers both in the Philippines and the U.S. These cultural workers are part of the National Democratic Movement of the Philippines. Data was collected in the Philippines and the U.S. through interviews and field observations. The participants in this study confirmed the assumptions offered by the theories that guided this work, through the experiences they shared. Their organizing through cultural work is in essence the social practice of Theater of the Oppressed. Their role as critical organic catalyst is exemplified their practice of being Artist-Teacher-Organizer-Researcher (ATOR) with the communities they align themselves with. Lastly, the cultural workers closely identified with the National Democratic Movement of the Philippines as a social movement with a distinct social process of transnational collective action.",1616826339,,Dissertations & Theses," Leano, Ryan A.LeanoA.RyanLeano, Ryan A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3472540771 , 91280522 , 66569 , 9781321197990 , 3637225 , 3637225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321197990, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1616826339?accountid=14496," 0282 Bilingual education , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0357 Fine arts , 0615 Political science"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0357 Fine arts , 0615 Political science"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0357 Fine arts , 0615 Political science",," 0282 Bilingual education , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0357 Fine arts , 0615 Political science"," Bilingual education , Asian American Studies , Fine arts , Political science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Education , Cultural work , Culture , Philippines , Social movements , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Artist+as+citizen%3A+Transnational+cultural+work+in+the+National+Democratic+Movement+of+the%0APhilippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leano%2C+Ryan+A.&amp;isbn=9781321197990&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"708,Learning on the Move: Mobile Educational Programs for Displaced Global Citizens,"Utilizing a dual analytical framework of forced displacement from above and a growing contemporary condition of ´placelessness´ from below, I attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of building mobile and cross-border educational networks to reach people who have been dislocated from their communities of origin due to rapid economic restructuring across the globe.

The results of this initial study, which focuses on migrant assistance shelters in Tijuana, Mexico, are significant due to the constraints on our current understanding of education, and how those understandings are challenged by increasingly mobile populations who require a different approach to meet their educational needs.

Over the past two decades, waves of popular mobilization have swept across the continent, in resistance against both neoliberal regimes and the post-neoliberal capitalist models of the new ""progressive"" governments. This dissertation explores the ways these autonomous movements theorize their own practices, creating a body of theory for a generation politicized at the turn of the twenty-first century. By zooming in on a concrete object and tool—the print book—the dissertation reveals how this unique cultural artifact is complexly ""double"": it is the materialization of an emerging alternative political-economic praxis that its pages (the content) also propose. This networked ethnography emerges from more than two years of participatory research with movements, writers, presses, and booksellers in the capital cities of Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. Moving through the different spaces occupied by these actors—and their tools—I combine ethnographic narratives describing the practices through which the writers, presses, and movements make and circulate their books with theoretical analysis of the concepts these publications disseminate. As the tools and ideas generated by these actors circulate and travel in unprecedented ways, multidimensional networks are multiplying across the continent. The alternative presses, whose practices I follow, are on the frontlines of this process. With its transnational perspective and transdisciplinary approach, The Book in Movement offers an exploration of the uneven ways that both the colonial legacy of print culture and the current expansion of capitalist regimes impact popular knowledge practices.",1617975059,,Dissertations & Theses," Rabasa, MagaliRabasaMagaliRabasa, Magali",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3474740551 , 91352692 , 66569 , 9781321212716 , 3637889 , 3637889", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321212716, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617975059?accountid=14496, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies,, 0550 Latin American Studies, Latin American Studies," Social sciences , Autonomy , Books , Latin america , Networks , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Book+in+Movement%3A+Autonomous+Politics+and+the+Recrafting+of+Books+in+Latin+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rabasa%2C+Magali&amp;isbn=9781321212716&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"710,Dissolving transnational boundaries: Interfaces and invitations to embody,"While social media has garnered attention for its entertainment and market value, it has received less consideration for its contribution to transnational activism. In particular, we have yet to examine the practices of individual users away from the fun and lighthearted contexts with which social media is generally connected. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap through an examination that addresses the following question: How do protestors' uses of social media facilitate the garnering of transnational support in the context of a social protest movement? I answer this question through a fine-grained analysis of the use of social media by Egyptian protestor Gigi Ibrahim during the Egyptian Revolution that occurred between January 25 and February 11 of 2011, exploring four sub-questions. First, I ask: How do activists represent their local experiences of protest across digital social media interfaces? Then, I address the question: How does a digital social media interface facilitate connections between protestors' local experiences and their digital presence in a transnational context of social activism? This is followed by an examination led by the question: How are transnational audiences invited to participate in digital events of social protest? And, finally, this project acknowledges the limitations of the supportive relationships that Ibrahim forged across social media interfaces by asking: When transnational audiences take up protestors' invitations to participate, how do these protestors maintain transnational relationships with these audiences across a digital social media interface? The data set for this project examines Ibrahim's use of Twitter from January 15, ten days before the protests began, until the evening of February 11, when President Hosni Mubarak stepped down. This focus was chosen because of the highly visible use of social media by protestors during this Revolution and the explicit ways in which many of them, including Ibrahim, used these platforms to build supportive ties with transnational audiences. Beginning this data set 10 days before the protests began enables this dissertation to examine not only how protestors used social media during a transnational protest, but also how they used social media to prepare for these protests as well. This data was organized and filtered using an archive that I constructed using the OMEKA platform. This archive allows for a robust and multifaceted analysis of Ibrahim's tweets that acknowledges the many facets of these pieces of digital ephemera. My analysis of Ibrahim's nearly 900 tweets yields four key insights into social media and transnational protest. First, to secure transnational attention, Ibrahim created digital representations of her local, physically embodied experiences and then connected these representations across the digital social media interface to a mediatized context that she shared with transnational audiences who were also using Twitter. Second, Twitter's digital interface enabled Ibrahim to maintain key connections between the physical and digital spaces of the Revolution by forming what I refer to as a hybrid embodiment, a critical means by which she maintained these connections across the interface. Third, Ibrahim employed her hybrid embodiment to invite transnational audiences to form hybrid embodiments of their own as a result of their participation in the mediatized event of the Revolution, participation that she elicited through her creation of kairos across Twitter's digital interface. Finally, Ibrahim addressed the risk of cooptation by her Western audiences who formed hybrid embodiments as participants in the Revolution and threatened to use their support of the January 25 protests to reassert their own ostensible cultural superiority. Ibrahim addressed this risk through a process of disidentification wherein she reestablished not only the social and physical distance of these audiences from the Revolution, but also their complicity in the very acts of violence by Mubarak that Ibrahim and other protestors were trying to end. The contributions of this dissertation are threefold. First, this work expands our understanding of the processes that give rise to transnationalism in the context of digital activism. In particular, it reveals the discursive and nondiscursive tactics engaged by one protestor to extend the Egyptian Revolution from a national movement to a transnational one. Second, this project provides insight into the role played by corporeal bodies in transnational digital spaces. Within these spaces, the corporeal bodies of activists were not disembodied across the digital interface. Rather, these corporeal bodies were essential to Ibrahim's activism both on and offline. Finally, this project reveals digital interfaces as porous and fluid phenomena which, like the bodies that engage them, enable the intervention of actor-rhetors across multiple spaces simultaneously. As such, the digital interface becomes a location that informed Ibrahim's physical and digital, local and transnational, presences during the Revolution and, furthermore, enabled her to maintain both of these key presences as she went about the work of social protest and negotiated Mubarak's many forms of violence that sought to silence her.",1617976731,,Dissertations & Theses," Bridgman, KatherineBridgmanKatherineBridgman, Katherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3474756381 , 91353462 , 66569 , 9781321213676 , 3637950 , 3637950", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321213676, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617976731?accountid=14496, 0560 North African Studies, 0560 North African Studies, 0560 North African Studies,, 0560 North African Studies, North African Studies," Social sciences , Digital interface , Social media , Social protest movement , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dissolving+transnational+boundaries%3A+Interfaces+and+invitations+to+embody&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bridgman%2C+Katherine&amp;isbn=9781321213676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"711,Individual Paths to the Global Ummah: Islamic Revival and Ethnic Identity in Northwest China,"The ongoing resurgence of religious practice in China features an Islamic revival characterized by rejection of the traditional association of religion with ethnicity, emphasis on individual understanding and devotion, and the embrace of an imagined transnational community that is both modern and universal. Exploring how this revival influences individual experiences of religion and the status of Islam and the Hui ethnic group of Chinese-speaking Muslims within the Chinese state uncovers profound implications for the relationships among religion, ethnicity and modernity and the role of religion within secular states. This study is based on ethnographic research in and around Xining, Qinghai Province, among participants in the Salafiyya and Tablighi Jama'at movements, converts to Islam, and ""reaffirmed Muslims"" who have recently embraced more devout forms of Islamic practice without changing their sectarian affiliation.  The history of Islam in China contextualizes modern revival movements as the latest in a long line of new ideas Chinese Muslims have brought from the Middle East to revitalize and unintentionally destabilize Chinese Islam. Contrasting nonobservant ""ethnic Muslims"" with devout ""reaffirmed Muslims"" illustrates key characteristics of revival that transcend sectarian boundaries to create broader forms of identification perceived to be more modern. Profiling imams from different sects highlights how theological debates underlie differences in religious practice and authority. Describing how individuals withstand social and familial censure to participate in Tablighi Jama'at or Salafiyya, convert to Islam, or embrace more devout forms of practice illustrates how some perceive embracing the universal ummah over devalued local communities as a form of individual empowerment. These individual paths to revival have broad implications for our understanding of ethnic, national, and transnational identities and communities within China and other secular states. Numerous profiles of informants reveal diverse visions of modernity and perceptions of transnational alliances and conflicts within and in relation to the global ummah. Overall, most Chinese Muslims see themselves as a particularly virtuous group within (and usually not wholly opposed to) the predominantly Han and atheist nation. Revivalists tend to emphasize a sense of belonging to an imagined transnational community rather than a parochial ethnic community or a materialist national one.",1619641989,,Dissertations & Theses," Stewart, Alexander BlairStewartBlairAlexanderStewart, Alexander Blair",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3481457901 , 89675472 , 66569 , 9781321235609 , 3639256 , 3639256", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321235609, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1619641989?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0512 Islamic Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0512 Islamic Studies"," Religious history , Cultural anthropology , Islamic Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , China , Ethnicity , Hui , Islamic revival , Salafiyya , Tablighi jama'at",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+the+will+to+Wessex+to+Arkham%3A+Lovecraft%27s+geophilosophical+debt+to+Hardy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marks%2C+David&amp;isbn=9781124785233&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"712,Grassroots Surrealism: The Culture of Opposition and the Crisis of Development in 1930s California,"This dissertation examines the upsurge of working-class social movements in rural and urban California during the Great Depression era. As the twentieth century's worst economic crisis unfolded in one of the most rapidly modernizing regions among industrialized nations, Grassroots Surrealism traces how Depression-era Californians made sense of conditions they confronted, pursued self-defined needs and aspirations, and contributed to the making of a broader, multiracial and transnational oppositional culture in the process. It argues that significant currents of grassroots movements in 1930s California advanced a politics of ""grassroots surrealism,"" which rejected the rationalist strictures that dominated modern, Western thought and regarded desire, imagination, and creativity as indispensible political priorities. Rather than reflecting a unifying social-democratic agenda or a homogenizing American identity, California's grassroots surrealists asserted political visions that underscored the interconnectedness and interdependence of global struggles for dignity, against the dehumanizing effects of Western imperialism and racial capitalism. Grassroots Surrealism offers a comparative and relational examination of the struggles of multiethnic Mexican, Filipino, Asian, African American, Native American, and European American working populations in the Imperial Valley's agricultural fields, San Francisco's waterfront, Los Angeles' culture industry, and Mendocino County's Round Valley Indian Reservation. It excavates the under-examined sources of rank and file workers and working-class communities—in oral histories, community newspapers, and expressive culture—alongside the records of union leaders and politicians that have traditionally anchored the field. As it analyzes grassroots politics in forms that ranged from strikes to jazz music across the capitalist landscape--from rural to urban and north to south in California—it reveals how seemingly disparate communities were linked in their myriad struggles against Depression-era capitalism. Ultimately, this dissertation destabilizes dominant narratives of the New Deal by demonstrating that corporatist and social-democratic politics were far from popular consensus. It brings into focus California's place in the global capitalist map, locates multiethnic working communities within that cartography, and shows how their efforts to remake the 1930s were far more heterogeneous, multivalent, and contested than scholars have previously recognized.",1624878813,,Dissertations & Theses," Sine, Elizabeth E.SineE.ElizabethSine, Elizabeth E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3494076451 , 91724562 , 66569 , 9781321324013 , 3644297 , 3644297", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321324013, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1624878813?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," American history , Ethnic studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , California , Culture , Great depression , Labor , Race/ethnicity , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grassroots+Surrealism%3A+The+Culture+of+Opposition+and+the+Crisis+of+Development+in+1930s+California&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sine%2C+Elizabeth+E.&amp;isbn=9781321324013&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"713,"Nation-Empire: Rural Youth Mobilization in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea 1895-1945","By the turn of the twentieth century, ""rural youth"" came to symbolize the spirit of hard work, masculinity, and patriotism. The village youth associations, the seinendan, as well as a number of other youth training programs, carried that ideal and spread it all over the Japanese empire. This dissertation examines how the movement to create ""rural youth"" unfolded in different parts of the empire and how young farmers responded to this mobilization. By examining three rural areas in Miyagi (northern Japan), Xinzhu (Taiwan), and South Ch'ungch'oˇng (Korea), I argue that the social tensions and local dynamics, such as the divisions between urban and rural, the educated and the uneducated, and the young and the old, determined the motivations and emotional drives behind youth participation in the mobilization. To invert the analytical viewpoint from the state to youth themselves, I use the term ""Rural Youth Industry."" This indicates the social sphere in which agrarian youth transformed themselves from perpetual farmers to success-oriented modern youth, shared an identity as ""rural youth"" by incorporating imperial and global youth activism, and developed a sense of moral superiority over the urban, the educated, and the old. The social dynamics of the ""Rural Youth Industry"" explain why many of these youth so internalized the ideology of Japanese nationalism that they volunteered for military service and fought for the empire. This dissertation offers a new perspective to the study of modern empires in several respects. It provides a new way to dissect the colonial empire, challenging the methodological trap of emphasizing the present-day national boundaries of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. It highlights rural modernity, often neglected in the urban-centric historiography of colonial modernity. It also brings together global, regional, and local histories. The seinendan were part of the global waves of imperialism, nation-state building, agrarianism, and the rise of youth. I argue that the spread of the ""Rural Youth Industry"" most clearly exemplifies a central characteristic of the Japanese empire, which is summarized as its drive to pursue nation-building across its imperial domains, forming a ""nation-empire."" This dissertation examines the operations of the ""nation-empire"" at the grassroots level by comparing the social environments of mobilized agrarian youth.

Historians often overlook this early Anglo-American community of scholars, as it was built upon the interactions of individuals, not institutions. American and British universities did not establish institutional links until the end of the century, when degrees and international affiliations became more standardized. Individual British and American scholars, however, were already corresponding, collaborating, and teaching at the same universities early in the century. These connections, and similar education reform movements in each country, created a core of professional attributes that British and American scholars shared. By the middle of the nineteenth century, interconnected academic communities were forming in British and American universities. At the end of the century, an Anglophone academic community had been established, extending even into the settler colonies of the British Empire. This project concludes that the roots of the modern academic profession are based on the efforts of individual scholars, whose interactions mark the origins of our transatlantic academic community. The origins of the academic profession are found within the eighteenth-century republic of letters, from which it inherited its emphasis on publication and international scholarly exchange. To this traditional were added new values of middle class professionalism, public service as intellectuals, and a belief that institutionalized certification was a prerequisite for authority and social status. Combining these values, a new ""professional scholar"" emerged during the nineteenth century. Professional scholars in the United States and Britain came to be defined by four general characteristics: First, scholars were expected to publish scholarly materials. Second, they held university or college teaching positions, which became their primary source of income. Third, they expected full university membership, which would entitle them to a voice in university governance and policy. Finally, they were expected to serve as public intellectuals and authorities in their fields of specialization. In addition to distinguishing them from the ""gentleman scholars"" of the previous century, these shared professional values facilitated transatlantic interactions between British and American scholars. This transatlantic dimension was significant in shaping the resulting academic profession. It created a system in which transnational exchange was a professional commodity, used to demonstrate a scholar's authority, success, and social standing. Establishing interpersonal networks based upon a set of shared professional values, these scholars developed a system of intellectual exchange unique to the first half of the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth-century republic of letters, the intended audience for scholarly publication was a narrow and closed elite. The intended audiences of the professional scholars, by contrast, included middle class readers. Unlike transnational exchanges at the end of the century, which were based upon institutional links, the nineteenth-century academic community based upon by individual connections. Scholars communicated and collaborated with transatlantic counterparts to demonstrate their professional authority, but they did so without institutional assistance. The network of personal connections they established would ultimately lead to the Anglo-American academic profession, but the actual conceptualization of their community was a distinctive feature of the early nineteenth century. At a broader level, the transatlantic activities of early professional scholars demonstrate the changing shape of Anglo-American intellectual exchange during the nineteenth century. Though Americans are viewed as unequal partners in early academic and intellectual exchanges, their status and influence within the partnership grew as the century progressed. Even after two centuries of change, the early nineteenth-century characteristics of the profession remain at the core of the Anglo-American and Anglophone academic communities.

But neoliberal practices have extended their scope beyond the economic sphere by materializing as social practices and policies that process social identity to accommodate neoliberal goals. Under the influence of neoliberalism and its conservative political values civic discourse has given way to a language of commercialization, privatization, and deregulation that has resulted in subjective identities rooted in the workings of market relations. The exchange between neoliberalism and the processing of social identity is best observed by examining the construction, maintenance and commodification of identity on the U.S.- Mexico border. Since the 1970s the U.S.-Mexico border has been and continues to produce shifting boundaries and identities that facilitate the expansion of neoliberal economic reforms. Social identities have been produced on the border which merge labor with transnational neoliberal reforms; in a sense, producing a class of laborers whose identities are not localized, instead they are globalized. The shifting of boundaries has resulted in the identification of the border with immigrant bodies, resulting in the border moving with bodies across national boundaries. The movement of immigrant bodies across national boundaries identifies them as ""bodies out of place"". The United States responds to the ""bodies out of place"" by enacting legislative responses, such as the DREAM Act and DACA, which neoliberalize the identities of these bodies.",1636505597,,Dissertations & Theses," Simmers, Jennifer KimeaSimmersKimeaJenniferSimmers, Jennifer Kimea",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3527962531 , 90533772 , 66569 , 9781321320596 , 3644020 , 3644020", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321320596, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1636505597?accountid=14496, 0628 Individual & family studies, 0628 Individual & family studies, 0628 Individual & family studies,, 0628 Individual & family studies, Individual & family studies," Social sciences , Hegemonic practices , Neoliberal ideology , Social identity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hegemonic+Practices+and+Neoliberal+Ideology%3A+Conjunctions+and+Disjunctions+in+Discussions+of+Social+Identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Simmers%2C+Jennifer+Kimea&amp;isbn=9781321320596&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"717,"Transforming subjectivities: Global mental health, biopolitics, &amp;amp; depression in Chile","As the leading cause of disability around the world (WHO 2012), depression has become a major public health concern. The global mental health movement has organized to increase access to mental health care within primary care and to protect the human rights of those who experience mental illnesses. Within this movement, the World Health Organization (WHO) MIND Project which operated in the early 2000s aimed to increase services and legal protections for people with mental illness, through collaboration with national governments and with the assertion that through such collaboration, global psychiatric knowledge would trickle down to the general population. Foucault (1978) has argued that in contemporary society, governance takes place through biopolitics as the “making live” of populations through construction of health problems as simultaneously political and economic ones. Rose (2007) posited that the outcome of living in such a society is the creation of individual-level biological citizenship, where people increasingly see themselves in biological ways. Biological citizenship is theorized as an active process of describing the self in biologically-colored languages while also making demands upon the state for the provision of health care. This dissertation project examined the potential transfer of psychiatric knowledge from the global organizational level to the level of individuals in Chile, a country claimed as a success of the global mental health movement. This project utilized qualitative, ethnographic methods over a six-month period in Santiago, Chile, to explore the biopolitical management of depression, including discourse analysis, observations, and interviews. Observations took place in the psychiatry departments of two public hospitals. Interviews were conducted with people undergoing treatment for depression at either hospital, care providers working in mental health, and a set of people outside of the medical realm who may or may not have had any experience with depression. Discourse analysis of texts from global and national levels revealed that the management of mental health, and depression specifically, occurred in ways congruent with biopolitical governance (Foucault 1978, Rabinow &amp; Rose 2006). Observations and interviews showed that depression was seen in contradictory ways, both social and biological. While patients generally felt any of a myriad of interpersonal problems caused their depression, depression was explained as being seen as an illness similar to physical ailments, requiring biomedical intervention. Outsiders and providers more often relied on biological explanations for the mental illness, but all of the interview participants felt depression was on the rise. Many felt the increase in depression throughout the population was due to society becoming more fast-paced, competitive, and individualistic, with superficial communication and relationships between people. Such feelings of disconnect from the larger population being interpreted as depression represent the medicalization of anomie (Durkheim 1997), in line with biopolitical governance through the inspiration of self-regulation (with regards to pharmaceutical treatments) for the good of the whole. A vast majority of those interviewed were women, who often described their responsibilities as overwhelming them, leading to depression; one woman explained that continuing to hold responsibility over the household in addition to the pressures of the workplace (also called the stalled revolution; Hochschild and Machung 2012) was too much to bear. Through medicalizing women’s experiences, such feelings of being overwhelmed are constructed and handled as issues of individual biology rather than problems within the social structure. None of the patients or the outsiders made explicit statements that the state should be responsible for the care of depression, even when asked about health care. The findings from this research indicate the need to widen biological citizenship to include implied biological definitions and passive demands on the state, as a new gradational biological citizenship.",1639700761,,Dissertations & Theses," Cuthbertson, Courtney A.CuthbertsonA.CourtneyCuthbertson, Courtney A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3535225531 , 92623372 , 66569 , 9781321364927 , 3646477 , 3646477", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321364927, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1639700761?accountid=14496," 0347 Mental health , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0347 Mental health , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0347 Mental health , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0347 Mental health , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," Mental health , Latin American Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Biopolitics , Chila , Depression , Global mental health , Globalization , Psychiatry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+subjectivities%3A+Global+mental+health%2C+biopolitics%2C+%26amp%3B+depression+in+Chile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cuthbertson%2C+Courtney+A.&amp;isbn=9781321364927&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"718,"Parallel Situations: Artur Barrio, Brazilian Art, and International Exchange in the Post-Studio Era (1969–1974)","This dissertation explores the work of artist Artur Barrio (b. 1945) and selected contemporaries in the context of the writings of critic and curator Frederico Morais (b. 1936) and a series of exhibitions that defined a new approach to artistic production in Brazil beginning in the late 1960s. Barrio is best known for his Situation series (begun 1969), in which he dispersed sacks filled with abject materials such as raw meat and trash—what he called “bloody bundles”—into the museums, waterways, and streets of major Brazilian cities. Created during a time of military dictatorship, this series has been widely interpreted as an indictment of the junta that ruled the country between 1964 and 1985. I take up a rather different aspect of the work of Barrio and his contemporaries, little explored but no less crucial. Focusing in particular on four Brazilian exhibitions—the Salão da Bússola (1969), Do Corpo à Terra (1970), Expo-projeção (1973) and Prospectiva 74 (1974)—I consider the artists’ participation in the transnational development of “post-studio” practices such as arte povera , land art, mail art, and new media art, and how they adapted those practices to speak to local concerns such as Third Worldism. Barrio’s use of cheap and easily accessible materials, for example, allowed him to subvert economic hierarchies. Like other Brazilian artists he rejected the advanced technologies and communications theories in vogue at the time because of their association with neocolonialism, opting instead for “poor” materials and simple bodily expression. At the same time, these artists were attracted to the increased mobility afforded by the new forms of art making. “Post-studio” practices thus allowed artists to signal a commitment to Third Worldism through the use of inexpensive materials while simultaneously reaching a large international audience, exhibiting their work, alongside that of their foreign peers, in landmark exhibitions such as the Museum of Modern Art’s Information (1970). I pay particular attention to exhibition history and Morais’s critical writings because combined they provide the clearest articulation of a Brazilian engagement with transnational trends. In both Morais’s writings and the critical reception of the explored exhibitions, Brazilian artists were positioned in terms of comparable “post-studio” movements abroad. Morais further posited Brazilian artists as heirs to earlier vanguard movements such as constructivism and Dadaism that similarly proposed a collapsing of art and life, thereby extending the social lessons of the historic avant-garde to define the formation of a Brazilian neo-vanguard. Far from passively adopting foreign trends, Brazilian artists at this time fundamentally shaped what would later be called “global conceptualism.” The work of Barrio and his contemporaries exemplifies the changing artistic and social landscape of what I term the “post-studio” era. The unique properties of this type of production and the expanded audience it reached allowed these artists to address local concerns in the international arena.",1640734952,,Dissertations & Theses," Brodbeck, Anna KatherineBrodbeckKatherineAnnaBrodbeck, Anna Katherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3538786091 , 87167772 , 66569 , 9781321374186 , 3665115 , 3665115", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321374186, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640734952?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Avant-garde , Barrio, Artur , Brazil , Global conceptualism , Morais, Frederico , New Media , Third Worldism , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Parallel+Situations%3A+Artur+Barrio%2C+Brazilian+Art%2C+and+International+Exchange+in+the+Post-Studio+Era+%281969%E2%80%931974%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brodbeck%2C+Anna+Katherine&amp;isbn=9781321374186&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"719,"Pathways of Insurgency: Black Liberation Struggle and the Second Reconstruction, 1945-1975","After several centuries of slavery and half a century of formal caste subordination, in the three decades following WWII, hundreds of thousands of black people in the United States participated in insurgent social movements. In the years immediately following WWII, Black Anti-colonialists petitioned the United Nations for international military intervention against lynching in the U.S., and mobilized street protests, asserting common cause with liberation struggles in Africa and Asia, challenging President Truman's global leadership and aiming to split the Democratic Party. After a period of quiescence, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, civil rights activists, calling for equal and integrated participation in the U.S., challenged de facto disenfranchisement and physically defied the legal and customary segregation of public spaces through nonviolent civil disobedience. And in the late 1960s, revolutionary black nationalists denied the legitimacy of U.S. governance generally, mobilizing parallel government at the community level, establishing ""diplomatic relations"" with socialist States from China and N. Vietnam to Algeria and Cuba, and engaging in armed confrontation with police. What were the causes and consequences of Black Liberation Struggle, 1945-1975? When considered in terms of practices, Black Liberation Struggle 1945-1975 followed three distinct phases – Black Anti-colonialism in the late 1940s, the civil rights movement in the early 1960s, and Black revolutionary nationalism in the late 1960s. In each movement, a distinct and relatively coherent set of insurgent practices emerged, rapidly proliferated, and then subsided. Not only were the practices different, but the ""indigenous institutions"" and social networks upon which these movements built were largely distinct, and the political allies of one were often political enemies of another. Building on the insights of the political process tradition, yet seeking to transcend its limitations, I advance a new, more truly processual theory of social movements which I dub ""pathways of insurgency theory"". I show that when insurgents develop a set of practices which is highly disruptive and difficult to repress in a given historic context, they open a pathway of insurgency, and mobilization proliferates in terms of those insurgent practices.",1640769132,,Dissertations & Theses," Bloom, JoshuaBloomJoshuaBloom, Joshua",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3539087131 , 87489562 , 66569 , 9781321364439 , 3646428 , 3646428", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321364439, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640769132?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Black power , Civil rights movement , Insurgent practice , Political opportunity , Race , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pathways+of+Insurgency%3A+Black+Liberation+Struggle+and+the+Second+Reconstruction%2C+1945-1975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bloom%2C+Joshua&amp;isbn=9781321364439&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"720,The road ahead: American automobility and the politics of the future,"How does the United States envision the future of automobility – the autonomous mobility made possible by motor vehicles – in the context of global climate change and resource depletion? This dissertation examines official representations of America's mobility future as articulated in texts produced by the advanced vehicle research programs of the US Department of Energy (DOE); the smart growth initiatives of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and the writings of Transition US, a part of the broader transnational grassroots Transition Movement. Using discourse analysis, the dissertation investigates how, in narrating the future of the automobile in America, these texts perform political work: producing distinct forms of subjecthood and legitimating a range of actions in the present. The findings indicate that automobility's dominance of the American imagination is being unsettled as discourse about the future of the automobile fragments into three narratives. One narrative envisions technological acceleration into a future where climate change is manageable and where Americans remain highly mobile, autonomous, driver-consumers. One sees the future as an opportunity to repair the social and environmental damage wrought by 20 th -century automobility by transforming the built environment to resemble the pre-automobile landscape, thereby recovering Americans' latent social nature and affinity for neighborhood. The third expects the inevitable end of the automobile age in the face of runaway climate change and peak oil; it sees this radical discontinuity as an opportunity for human adaptability and community resilience. In each narrative, expectations about what can and should happen derive from irreconcilable core assumptions about human nature and how much of the world is in human hands.

Grounded in 32 months of ethnographic fieldwork and over 200 interviews, it documents the rise of a profound disenchantment, particularly among millennials, with state-based solutions to pressing contemporary problems and, more broadly, with the nation-state project itself. Drawing on first-hand accounts ranging from elite boardrooms and think tank conference rooms, to political demonstrations and direct actions, to student reading groups and gatherings of cryptoanarchist communities, the dissertation situates the ethnographic study within the broader framework of a reconfiguration of U.S. populism in the era of the security state. The project examines how established libertarian organizations, a key component of the longstanding U.S. conservative coalition, have helped infuse libertarianism with renewed relevance for a substantial part of an entire generation deeply disheartened by a world embroiled in economic crisis and heavily militarized systems of governance. Through the consolidation of a libertarian wing of the Republican Party, parts of the liberty movement are presently shaking up the very conservative coalition that helped usher forth the movement's revival. But libertarianism's resurgence is also powerfully reshaping U.S. political culture beyond formal political processes, giving rise to a proliferation of libertarian spaces that expressly reject effecting change through electoral politics and policy in favor of changing ""hearts and minds"" by promoting libertarian principles and social organization. Simultaneously, growing numbers of millennials influenced by the liberty movement increasingly challenge its dominant trends, focusing on the experiences of vulnerable and marginalized groups — from urging the integration of libertarianism with a broader socioeconomic critique as well as antiracism, feminism, mutual aid, and labor solidarity, to revisiting the ideas of 19th century U.S. individualist anarchists. Thus, while the libertarian political establishment is likely to continue to expand over the coming years and secure a firmer place in the Republican Party, the movement simultaneously serves as a siphon — growing numbers of millennial libertarians are presently breaking from the political right and moving closer to various forms of left libertarianism, market anarchism, mutualism, and even social anarchism. The project thus illustrates the centrality of cultural formations beyond policy and electoral politics to the largest popular movement motivated by distinctly libertarian ideas in the postwar period, as well as to reconfigurations of U.S. liberalism. The dissertation contributes to a burgeoning literature on the resurgence of antistatist theory and organizing in the new millennium. Scholars and activists alike continue to document especially the revitalization of social anarchist traditions permeating numerous contemporary struggles, tracing how the resuscitation of social anarchist thought and activism informs important parts of extant insurgency across the globe. The U.S. liberty movement presents another key but understudied aspect of the present antistate moment. The dissertation also builds on longstanding anthropological approaches to understanding the complex processes through which political ideologies are shaped and constituted. Through an ethnographic lens, it interrogates how deeply ingrained U.S. ideologies of freedom, individualism, and even liberalism itself are interpreted, contested, and reappropriated to both challenge and reinscribe relations of power. The libertarian resurgence represents a crucial struggle over the very meaning and direction of U.S. liberalism in our historical moment.",1641125625,,Dissertations & Theses," Tretjak, KajaTretjakKajaTretjak, Kaja",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3540996781 , 86133072 , 66569 , 9781321288193 , 3642162 , 3642162", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321288193, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1641125625?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," American studies , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , Anarchism , Conservatism , Libertarianism , Populism , Social movements , U.s. politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Millennial+libertarians%3A+The+rebirth+of+a+movement+and+the+transformation+of+U.S.+political+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tretjak%2C+Kaja&amp;isbn=9781321288193&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"722,Santa Coloma de Gramenet: The Transformation of Leftwing Popular Politics in Spain (1968-1986),"This dissertation examines leftwing popular political culture in the Spanish city of Santa Coloma de Gramenet from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. Using forty life history interviews and a variety of archival and printed sources, it first traces the processes of pre-political community formation, politicization and urban movement institutionalization that occurred in Spain's new industrial cities during the final decade of the Francoist dictatorship. The study then challenges the dominant scholarly view that the Spanish transition to democracy initiated a consensual process of demobilization. Although relations were complex, social movement activists, party militants and newly elected municipal officials continued to mobilize as they participated in ongoing European debates regarding the nature of democracy and socialism in the post-68 moment, the role of public memory in an age of extremist political violence and the international system of Cold War alliances. In addition to intervening in debates on the Spanish transition to democracy, this dissertation also presents an integrated account of the various dimensions of Europe's long 1968. As a local study, it traces the evolving relations and often-porous boundaries between different activist groups and ""new social movements"" while assessing the impact of widespread experiences of mobility and transnational contact.",1648674530,,Dissertations & Theses," Davis, Andrea RebeccaDavisRebeccaAndreaDavis, Andrea Rebecca",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3571692041 , 89987472 , 66569 , 9781321401721 , 3666861 , 3666861", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321401721, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1648674530?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Democratization , Modern spanish history , Oral history , Popular politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Santa+Coloma+de+Gramenet%3A+The+Transformation+of+Leftwing+Popular+Politics+in+Spain+%281968-1986%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davis%2C+Andrea+Rebecca&amp;isbn=9781321401721&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"723,Building Theory Across Struggles: Queer Feminist Thought from Lebanon,"This dissertation is an analysis of theoretical innovations emerging from the queer and feminist movements in Lebanon.

Whereas these movements are often seen as separate, I put forth a queer feminist anti-racist and transnational methodology that challenges the compartmentalization of social and political movements. I also argue that queer feminism in Lebanon is breaking away from linear concepts of time and is providing a cyclical temporality to show the interrelatedness of historical and current events. Finally, I examine the different ways that self-identified feminists reflect on the tensions and divisions within their communities. The process through which these local tensions are highlighted are critical of power structures within activist spaces, but they also aim at creating transnational connections with women of color in the U.S and with feminists of the Global South.",1650596686,,Dissertations & Theses," Kaedbey, Dima E.KaedbeyE.DimaKaedbey, Dima E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3577445761 , 93473942 , 66569 , 9781321501377 , 3672682 , 3672682", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321501377, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1650596686?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Womens studies , GLBT Studies , Middle Eastern Studies"," Social sciences , Arab women , Indigenous thought , Lebanon , Queer feminism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+Theory+Across+Struggles%3A+Queer+Feminist+Thought+from+Lebanon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kaedbey%2C+Dima+E.&amp;isbn=9781321501377&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"724,Emplacing Parenting: Migration and Belonging among Korean &lt;i&gt; Gireogi&lt;/i&gt; Families,"This dissertation explores emplaced transnational families' dynamics through an analysis of the categories of class, sense of place, sense of belonging and parenting among the so-called ""Korean gireogi families"".

The majority of the research focuses on mothers and children who live in McLean and Centreville of Fairfax school district located in Virginia, just a few miles from Washington, D.C. I argue that these transnational families construct distinct types of belonging, including structural belonging, relational belonging, school district belonging, and narrative belonging. Belonging is dependent on the Korean gireogi families' ability to mobilize social and cultural capital, the development and quality of relationship in the receiving communities, and their ability to rationalize the benefits of frequent movement and temporary settlement to reach their children's educational goals.

Through a regional analysis of the land politics articulations of organized urban gardening projects in the San Francisco Bay Area, I ask what are the landscapes of possibility or closure resulting from these entanglements. Historically urban gardening has been used as a temporary land use to ameliorate various social problems until the land owner, either public or private, chose to put the land to different use, most frequently the use that gained the highest market value. In the Bay Area, where land markets are highly competitive, land access is a central concern for gardeners. Urban agriculture has been theorized and embraced by social movement activists as a means to resist the allocation of land based on market valuation and the realization of the authority of property ownership. Yet, through research based on semi-structured interviews with gardeners and city officials, documents analysis, and participant observation, this dissertation describes a more complex terrain of activist engagements in the practices of land access and enactments of property. Two dominant imaginaries of land politics emerge from these engagements. One emphasizes the need for flexible, even portable gardens, in order to cultivate more resilient cities and movements. This imaginary is ultimately facilitative of development priorities, supporting neoliberal urban regimes, and reaffirming of contemporary property relations. The second imaginary identifies the importance of long-term tenure, community-management of land resources, and developing movement coalitions concerned with land access. This imaginary connects with the international work of food sovereignty, a framework that gardeners and US food movement activists are increasingly adopting, and which works to resist neoliberal capitalism, colonial legacies, and top-down governance. I suggest that the everyday utopian projects of gardeners is a key site to understanding the US left questioning if reforming contemporary social democratic institutions, like the provision of public space, are sufficient strategies. This analysis contributes to the developing field of urban political ecology by describing socio-ecological space in the Bay Region as socially produced through a history of practices, representations, and experiences of gardeners.",1655594755,,Dissertations & Theses," Glowa, K.

Reading the cultural production of Mexicans as text, this study utilizes music, film, and literature as primary sources alongside oral histories, and archival research from Mexico and the United States. I argue that the popular culture and media is both reflective of the migrant experience and contributes to the development of a transnational identity which challenges the official narrative of Mexican nationalism. In the post-revolutionary period, the Mexican government promoted a nationalism rooted in the racial identity of mestizaje , the social values of the middle class, and a gendered patriarchal order. Mexican labor migration to the United States de-territorializes national identity both for the migrants and the communities they leave behind. This lived experience combined with the media and cultural production which reflects Mexican migration serves to normalize the experience of movement, creating a sense of transnational identity for communities on both sides of the border even when one has never experienced the process of migration. Examining the role of migration in defining national identity complicates the official narrative to reveal that communities touched by migration develop a sense of rootedness in Mexico while simultaneously imagining a transnational existence.",1658482212,,Dissertations & Theses," Garza, Natalie M.GarzaM.NatalieGarza, Natalie M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3605947911 , 94351242 , 66569 , 9781321596694 , 3582133 , 3582133", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321596694, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1658482212?accountid=14496, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history,, 0336 Latin American history, Latin American history," Social sciences , Identity , Mexico , Migration , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mexico+flotante%3A+Migration%2C+culture%2C+and+national+identity+in+post-revolutionary+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garza%2C+Natalie+M.&amp;isbn=9781321596694&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"727,Sex and the Subversive Alien: The Interwoven Itineraries of Migrant Revolutionaries in the Twentieth-Century Atlantic World,"Sex and the Subversive Alien situates transnational migration, desire, and the family at the center of black revolutionary theory and praxis in the twentieth-century. This project maps multigenerational, multiracial, transnational networks of artists, activists, and intellectuals who participated in liberation movements in the Caribbean, North America, and Britain. Surveying networks and movements from the struggle against medical discrimination in 1920s Harlem to the 1970 ""Black Power Revolution"" in Trinidad and Tobago, this work examines the itineraries and adhesives that connected prominent revolutionaries like Grace Lee Boggs, C.L.R. James and Kwame Ture to lesser-known freedom fighters, particularly women and girls. Combining methods of literary analysis, immigration history, and social, political, and cultural history, this project charts the life course, political education, and migrations of transient activists, their entrance into diverse political formations in Britain and the United States, and the sexual politics of liberation. Sex and the Subversive Alien interrogates tensions between revolutionary ideologies and everyday praxis. While radical movements crafted egalitarian, anti-sexist and anti-racist political platforms, they often subordinated gender equality to patriarchy in practice. Within transatlantic liberation campaigns—from desegregation to anticolonial nationalism to women's liberation to black power—women and girls were prominent theorists, organizers, and foot soldiers. At great personal cost, radical women and girls advanced anti-sexism as an integral part of revolution. Devoting their physical and intellectual labor to theorizing, grassroots organizing and armed guerrilla movements, revolutionary women and girls endangered their lives in order to challenge and often overturn authoritarian patriarchal power in their homes, workplaces, and within freedom movements themselves. Desire, sex, and erotic autonomy, I argue, was central to black revolutionary formations. Autobiography and revolutionary self-making was a method of erasing the struggles of revolutionary women and girls from radical histories, and forgetting that intersectionality was always already the foundation of black radical traditions. From movements for self-government to black power, I argue, transatlantic networks, family, and desire generated, animated, and sustained revolts against white supremacy, imperialism, and state violence. Demands for gender equality played formative and divisive roles in liberation movements that both expanded democracy in metropolitan countries and transformed the political economy of the postcolonial Caribbean. The everyday lives of the migrant activists this project studies were interwoven with allies and enemies, the worldviews and trajectories of other complicated people whose personal and political biographies were as contradictory as their own. This is a human history, a character-driven analysis of individuals and collectives who practiced and betrayed anti-sexism in their daily lives.",1660538364,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, William ChristopherJohnsonChristopherWilliamJohnson, William Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3613892931 , 88663272 , 66569 , 9781321603231 , 3582233 , 3582233", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321603231, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1660538364?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," African American Studies , Caribbean Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , African Diaspora , Black Power , Black Radicalism , Caribbean Diaspora , Gender & Sexuality , Trinidad and Tobago",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sex+and+the+Subversive+Alien%3A+The+Interwoven+Itineraries+of+Migrant+Revolutionaries%0Ain+the+Twentieth-Century+Atlantic+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+William+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781321603231&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"728,"Kashmir's Cry for Freedom: The Questions of Identity, Sovereignty and Self-Determination, c.1900 - 2000","By focusing on themes of identity, sovereignty, and self-determination, this dissertation examines the evolution of political culture in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir from the early twentieth century to contemporary times. Rather than studying the borderland of Kashmir from the perspective of the nation-states, it weaves contradictory Kashmiri voices into the narrative of the conflict to understand the regional turmoil from their perspective. It examines Kashmiri Muslim understandings of freedom in different temporal frames and geographic spaces, with a primary focus on the voices of resistance that refused to accept the division of the former princely state into two halves. It argues that as the nation-states territorialized state power in the peripheries, with the help of political elites who furthered the nationalist agenda, Kashmiri Muslim voices of resistance initiated a non-violent movement for self-determination that promised to advance the interests of all who were victims of exploitation and state tyranny. Another strategy adopted by the political activists was to transgress the cease-fire line that separated the two parts of the disputed state to create inter-regional networks and connections that challenged state sovereignty. Additionally, the fight for freedom was not confined to the political contestations that emerged within the territorial boundaries of the subcontinent; the experiences of the Kashmiri diaspora are important in understanding the transnational dimension of Kashmiri resistance. Central to this resistance discourse was the concept of self-determination, which was widely invoked by Kashmiri Muslim political activists throughout the twentieth century to mobilize masses for the assertion of rights. It emerged in the 1920s as a movement to improve the socio-economic conditions of downtrodden Kashmiris through education, and to reinvigorate their confidence after decades of suppression at the hands of regimes that remained disconnected from the ruled. During the 1930s and 1940s, Kashmiri leaders explained freedom to ordinary Kashmiris in the context of the political economy, social relations, and political culture in the Valley. The concepts of human dignity, religious toleration, good social relations, and compassion for the poor formed the core idea of freedom. In the aftermath of decolonization, these visions of freedom remained unfulfilled as both nation-states exercised their domination, focused primarily on retaining Kashmir's territory. However, Kashmiri voices of resistance throughout its postcolonial history challenged the territorialization of the nation-states, which ignored the aspirations of the people. As I demonstrate in each chapter of my thesis, Kashmiri Muslims' understandings of self-determination had an emotional relevance that stemmed from their desire to restore Kashmiri dignity and put an end to the humiliations endured by generations of Kashmiris who had questioned the status quo. It also drew from concepts of economic equality and social justice, as Kashmiris envisioned a society free from social hierarchies and economic disparities. In placing Kashmir and Kashmiris at the center of the historical debate, my research contributes to broader debates on the relationship between territoriality and sovereignty in the borderlands, differentiation between popular and state sovereignty, connections between transnational networks and homeland, and relationship between human rights and state legitimacy.",1666453070,,Dissertations & Theses," Hussain, ShahlaHussainShahlaHussain, Shahla",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3635105631 , 94960062 , 66569 , 9781321615296 , 3685445 , 3685445", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321615296, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1666453070?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," History , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Decolonization , India-pakistan , Insurgency , Kashmir , Kashmiri muslims , Postcolonialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Kashmir%27s+Cry+for+Freedom%3A+The+Questions+of+Identity%2C+Sovereignty+and+Self-Determination%2C+c.1900+-+2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hussain%2C+Shahla&amp;isbn=9781321615296&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"729,"Ambassadors of the Working Class: Peronist Worker Attachés, International Labor Activism and the Rise and Fall of Latin American Populism (1945-1959)","Right after taking office in 1946, Argentine president Juan Perón gathered one hundred rank-and-file union members, called them ""missionaries of a social apostolate,"" gave them diplomatic title and sent them abroad to spread his movement's gospel of national emancipation and economic justice. This is the first study of these attachés, who were direct rivals to U.S. global efforts at labor diplomacy, and represented the largest presence of blue-collar workers in the foreign service of any country. This study exposes a dimension of the modern Americas that is difficult to imagine from today's perspective: how crucial the ""labor question"" was to mid-century debates about the nature and limits of democracy. It departs from existing historiography in several respects. First, through the worker attachés, I develop a transnational history of Peronism itself, analyzing it as part of the dynamic postwar global conjuncture that made populist movements especially strong in the expansion of social and political citizenship. Second, I highlight how anti-liberal ideas drawn from Spain contributed to both the most radical and more conservative moments of Peronism Third, I demonstrate the centrality of populism as a concept and a political construct to debates about liberalism, freedom, and democracy in the Americas, including as an input in U.S. domestic discussions about the legacies of the New Deal. Fourth, I show how Perón exemplified a form of ""authoritarian democratization"" in the region that enabled (and was a product of) a large reconfiguration of Latin American societies. I locate Peronism as a crucial player at the onset of the Cold War, rather than as an isolated phenomenon or the strange offspring of prewar fascism, as many scholars have argued.",1666863381,,Dissertations & Theses," Seman, Martin ErnestoSemanErnestoMartinSeman, Martin Ernesto",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3636480291 , 94994302 , 66569 , 9781321624656 , 3685908 , 3685908", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321624656, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1666863381?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations",," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," Latin American history , American history , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Diplomacy , Labor , Latin america , Liberalism , Peronism , United states",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ambassadors+of+the+Working+Class%3A+Peronist+Worker+Attach%C3%A9s%2C%0AInternational+Labor+Activism+and+the+Rise+and+Fall+of+Latin+American+Populism+%281945-1959%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Seman%2C+Martin+Ernesto&amp;isbn=9781321624656&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"730,Influence of social media in stages of democratization,"The Internet and social media have become a pervasive part of our global environment over the last few decades, utilized primarily for commerce, communication, and entertainment.

Gandhi on social and environmental movements in postcolonial India has been widely acknowledged. Yet, the contributions of two European associates of Gandhi, Madeleine Slade and Catherine Mary Heilemann, better known in India as Mira Behn and Sarala Behn, have not received the due attention of the academic community. This dissertation is an examination of the philosophy and social activism of Mira Behn and Sarala Behn and their roles in the evolution of Gandhian philosophy of socioeconomic reconstruction and environmental conservation in the present Indian state of Uttarakhand. Instead of just being acolytes of Gandhi, I argue that these women developed ideas and practices that drew upon from an extensive intellectual terrain that cannot be limited to Gandhi’s work. I delineate the directions in which Gandhian thought and experiments in rural development work evolved through the lives, activism, and written contributions of these two women. Particularly, I examine their influence on social and environmental movements, such as the Chipko and the Anti-Tehri Dam movements, and their roles in promoting grassroots social development and environmental sustainability in the mountain communities of Uttarakhand. Mira Behn and Sarala Behn’s integrative philosophical worldviews present epistemological, sociopolitical, ethical, and metaphysical principles and practices that have local and global significance for understanding interfaith dialog, social justice, and environmental sustainability and thus constitute a useful contribution to the theory and practice of human emancipation in our times.",1668087633,,Dissertations & Theses," Mallik, BidishaMallikBidishaMallik, Bidisha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3642061131 , 95114892 , 66569 , 9781321641196 , 3691176 , 3691176", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321641196, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1668087633?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability",," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability"," History , Asian Studies , Environmental philosophy , Philosophy , Sustainability"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Anti-tehri dam movement , Behn mira , Behn, sarala , Chipko , Environmental philosophy , Sustainability ethics , Uttarakhand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+contribution+of+Mira+Behn+and+Sarala+Behn+to+social+and+environmental+transformation+in+the+Indian+state+of+Uttarakhand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mallik%2C+Bidisha&amp;isbn=9781321641196&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"732,Social Media and Contentious Politics: Tunisia 2010-2013,"How do social media contribute to groups engaged in contentious politics within a domestic environment?

Through interviews with a group of 40 Tunisians, many of them active in contentious politics from 2010-2013, this research identifies what sources initially informed the group members of a movement as well as the sources that ultimately pushed them to become active. While information gleaned via social media certainly played a role in the decisions of many interviewees to join the movements examined in this research - unsurprising, given the high rates of internet use within the group - social media were often cited as less trustworthy than other sources and were more likely to inform the respondents of a movement's existence than to push them to act.

In particular, it explores the ways in which specific socioeconomic rights have been deployed in the context of three different global justice campaigns aimed at challenging various political-institutional regimes of neo-liberal global governance. This exploration has at its centre three case study chapters which in turn examine: (1) the role of the ‘right to food’ in the global campaign for food sovereignty; (2) the role of the ‘right to health’ in the global campaign for access to affordable medicines; and (3) the role of the ‘right to water’ in the global campaign for the protection of public water services. This thesis is informed by a neo-Gramscian analytic framework that views ‘global civil society’ as a sphere where the hegemony of neo-liberal globalisation is not only constructed and reproduced, but also potentially contested by marginalised and excluded (‘subaltern’) social forces. Through analysis of the role performed by socioeconomic rights in these three case studies, it is argued that socioeconomic rights can potentially serve counter-hegemonic movements, but there are also dangers, due to the configuration of power within the domain of global civil society, that socioeconomic rights discourses are co-opted, marginalised or watered down in ways that suppress their counter-hegemonic potential. Drawing upon the praxis of the global justice movements discussed in the case studies, this thesis argues that these dangers can be minimised, or at any rate mitigated, through what will be termed a ‘tripartite model of counter-hegemonic rights praxis’. This entails counter-hegemonic movements tactically participating in inter-governmental settings; invoking the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies and; connecting socioeconomic rights standards to counter-hegemonic models of governance within ‘subaltern counter-publics’.",1687709921,,Dissertations & Theses," Wills, Joe JonathanWillsJonathanJoeWills, Joe Jonathan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713047491 , 96500592 , 101309 , U639300 , U639300 , http://hdl.handle.net/2381/28978", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687709921?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0501 Economics, Economics," http://hdl.handle.net/2381/28978 , (UMI)AAIU639300 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+world+turned+upside+down%3F%3A+a+critical+enquiry+into+the+counter-hegemonic+potential+of+socioeconomic+praxis+in+global+civil+society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wills%2C+Joe+Jonathan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"734,Education as capital: educated bangladeshi immigrant women in 21st century britain,"This thesis examines education within a transnational capital movement framework, investigating the experiences of first-generation educated Bangladeshi immigrant women arriving in Britain between 1999 and 2007. Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology of education (1973, 1990 [1977]), his notions of forms of capital (1986), and a feminist perspective on these theories are utilized to explain the interplay of class and gender in educating middle-class Bangladeshi women, the economic and social value of these academic qualifications in migration, and the gendered dimension of social reproduction in their diaspora. In the discussion of Bangladeshi women in Britain, this thesis for the first time deals with educated women from that background (as opposed to the majority Sylheti community that has been the subject of much research). Its primary data are in-depth interviews with twenty-eight highly-educated Bangladeshi women across England. In my methodology chapter I discuss, inter alia, the problematic of researching social equals, and the possibilities and limitations of ‘partial knowledge’ within that context. My in-depth analysis of the narratives around the participants’ family, upbringing, education and gender structure establishes the theoretical relevance of Bourdieu’s concept of education as cultural capital in post-colonial, resource-poor Bangladeshi society. In discussing gender and the internationalization of higher education in this context, I revise Bourdieu’s definition of ‘academic capital’, proposing three main categories that operate in my participants’ lives: namely ‘elite’, ‘standard’ and ‘general’ academic capital. This thesis challenges the argument that human movement and capital movement are similar and equal by analysing the differentiated values of academic qualifications and academic capital in the advanced, neoliberal labour market of Britain where the host country’s specific ‘cultural capital’ is at play. Finally, my thesis extends knowledge about immigrant women’s involvement in the developing diasporic ‘middle class’ with an investigation of these educated Bangladeshi women’s social lives and ‘mother work’ in the framework of social reproduction. This thesis develops an original and new dialogue between skilled migration, the Bangladeshi community in Britain, and the dynamic of gender and social class across borders, inviting further debates within and beyond feminist thoughts around educated middle-class women’s migration and its far-reaching consequences in the contemporary transnational world.

To answer this question, I examine multiple ways in which they practice their relationships with “socio-natures” and how those practices have historically and transnationally developed, especially since the end of the Japanese empire in the mid-20th century. By conducting ethnographic and archival research about conventional farmers in Itoshima city, Fukuoka, Japan, I analyze a variety of practices, such as handling “harmful bugs” in rice paddies (including use of pesticides), fertilizer use, infrastructure modernization in rice paddies, a reduced pesticide rice farming movement, the 2005-2007 “Agriculture’s Blessings” government program (which subsidized farmers for investigating rice paddy bugs and other creatures and reducing pesticide use), and the Agricultural Land, Water, and the Environment Preservation and Improvement Policy, 2007-2011. I argue that the relationships of embodied human actors, non-human actors in farmlands, discourses, and institutions (transnational relations, science, logics of agricultural policy, farming technologies), in other words “regimes,” around socio-natures of rice paddies have shifted over time from the “nature-subduing agriculture” regime (the 1940s—1980s) to the “environmental conservation agriculture” regime (the 1980s—2010s). To explain the regimes and the shift over time, I take into account how those multiple actors in power relations have shaped each other from multiple directions. For example, pesticides that produced a particular rice paddy ecology and health issues for farmers and consumers helped rearticulate the relationships among rice paddy bugs, conventional farmers, consumers, pesticides, and government policy especially since the mid-1970s. The international trade policy, especially the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in the mid-1980s provided the “green box” to indirectly subsidize farming through agro-environmental government programs. A changing “gaze” toward the “rural” especially by the urbanites by the 1980s has similarly facilitated the regime shift. The study aims to contribute to the field partly by engaging with a number of theoretical and conceptual frameworks that have been underexplored in this empirical topic (e.g., political ecology, actor-network theory, productivism/post-productivism, and ecological modernization). The under-examined case of Japan also adds to the existing research on why conventional farmers join agro-environmental government programs primarily in “Western” countries. Finally, it problematizes the “environmental conservation agriculture” regime and sketches out an alternative possibility of “environmentally sustainable agriculture” combined with transnational social justice.",1705297759,,Dissertations & Theses," Ono, TakamitsuOnoTakamitsuOno, Takamitsu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3781985841 , 92623372 , 66569 , 9781321869514 , 3710936 , 3710936", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321869514, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1705297759?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology"," 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology"," 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology",," 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology"," History , Environmental philosophy , Agriculture , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agricultural policy , Conventional farming , Ethnography , Japan , Regimes , Socio-natures",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Historical+regimes+of+socio-natures+in+farmlands%3A+Practices+of+conventional+farming+in+Fukuoka%2C+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ono%2C+Takamitsu&amp;isbn=9781321869514&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"736,The thai-based 'burma movement': understanding underlying divisions,"This thesis explores the underlying dynamics of the Thai-based 'Burma Movement', before and after the game-changing 2010 election. In particular, it investigates the role of visible organisational divisions related to gender, ethnicity, and leadership disagreements, alongside differences in work styles and expectations related to international engagement. The Thai-based 'Burma Movement' posed a puzzle insofar as the organisational fragmentation of rights-based groups did not necessarily align with the goals, forms of activism/operation, and strategies of what was internationally understood as the movement for change in Burma. Subsequently, analysis of the underlying tensions of ethnic-minority rights-based organisations, in their specific forms of engagement with influential international actors, was required to aid understanding of the particular dynamics, successes and failures of the movement. The research builds on Bourdieu's tools of field, capital, habitus, and his reflexive methodological orientation, particularly in how these have been elaborated through Fligstein and McAdam’s concepts of strategic action fields (SAFs), resources and social skills. Fieldwork was conducted through semi-structured interviews with activists from two ethnicities (Arakan and Pa-Oh) on the Thai-Burma border. Analysing their perspectives revealed two concurrent SAFs: one with a United Burma orientation, and another based on Grassroots Nationalities . Furthermore, these SAFs drew on two different orientations related to resource perspectives, the Internationally-Influenced versus Community/Traditional-Influenced. Ethnicity and gender were acknowledged as culturally-entwined influences on status and access to opportunities, but ultimately both served as components within an individual's outlook rather than as separate SAFs. Authority, leadership and social skills were also identified as key factors in the success or failure of initiatives, in alignment with the same SAFs and resource perspectives. The research concludes that, while leadership and issue/ethnic/gender-related insularity were indeed important considerations, the identification of underlying, but divergent, perspectives related to SAFs, resources and applications of social skills ultimately offered greater explanatory insight.",1794984248,,Dissertations & Theses," Green, Pamela CatherineGreenCatherinePamelaGreen, Pamela Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4082601951 , 103732892 , 101309 , 10123295 , 10123295 , http://hdl.handle.net/2381/29149", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794984248?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/2381/29149 , (UMI)AAI10123295 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+thai-based+%27burma+movement%27%3A+understanding+underlying+divisions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Green%2C+Pamela+Catherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"737,"Behind the 2009 Tamil Diaspora Protests in Canada: A Critical Analysis of the Production of Race, Resistance, and Citizenship across Borders","Critical social workers emphasize activism for social justice, and acknowledge that global justice movements can inform the evolution of social work practice. Yet, scholarship on community practice and citizen participation has shown varying levels of attention to the interests and context of racialized populations. This dissertation engages this discussion by developing an understanding of what activism comes to be for migrant communities who experience social injustices across local, national and transnational scales. I draw upon a framework of citizenship, racialization and spatiality to problematize conditions of resistance through the 2009 Tamil diaspora protests in Canada. Through a Critical Discourse Analysis of print media and key informant interviews, I explore the following: (1) What are the ideologies underlying media representations of the movement in Canada? (2) How can social work researchers ethically represent the resistance movements of others? (3) Why and how does race frame the production of suffering and spectacle through protest? (4) How can we unpack representations of racialized local groups who protest an issue unfolding elsewhere? This project highlights the challenges experienced by racialized communities' in their struggles towards citizenship, social justice and decolonization. Chapter 1 presents the context of the 2009 Tamil diaspora protests, the conceptual framework, and methodology guiding this study. In accordance with the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work's 3-paper dissertation format, Chapter 2, 3 and 4 are stand-alone papers geared towards different peer-review journals. Chapter 2 problematizes how we should represent contested resistance movements in the age of terrorism. Chapter 3 examines how racial logic frames the expression of protesters' suffering, and the construction of the Canadian public's racial apathy. Chapter 4 explores how national media discourses racially and spatially mark protesters as ""others,"" ""outlaws,"" and ""outsiders."" The findings of this interdisciplinary study demonstrate how resistance by racialized groups in a white settler state is distorted by the indirect and direct representational politics imposed by a hegemonic West. In Chapter 5, I offer implications for social work theory, practice and education to reconsider the boundaries of social justice, incorporate a conceptualization of transnational activism as citizenship, and forefront the politics of protest.",1810174065,,Dissertations & Theses," Jeyapal, DaphneJeyapalDaphneJeyapal, Daphne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4142093491 , 91209682 , 66569 , 9781339897943 , 10131963 , 10131963", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781339897943, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810174065?accountid=14496," 0452 Social work , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0452 Social work , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0452 Social work , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0452 Social work , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Social work , Sociology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Protest , Race , Social activism , Space , Tamil diaspora protests",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Behind+the+2009+Tamil+Diaspora+Protests+in+Canada%3A+A+Critical+Analysis+of+the+Production+of+Race%2C+Resistance%2C+and+Citizenship+across+Borders&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jeyapal%2C+Daphne&amp;isbn=9781339897943&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"738,The sustainability of the social democratic welfare state in recessionary periods: a case study of barbados 1974-1994,"This thesis examines the factors and forces which contributed to the continued existence of Barbados’ social democratic welfare development model, despite changes in the global economy which favoured neoliberal policies promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This is achieved through an assessment of three World Bank funded education projects which were negotiated and implemented from 1974 to 1994. During this period the Government of Barbados also entered into three stabilisation programmes and a structural adjustment loan with the International Monetary Fund. These periods create the ideal analytical platform to investigate the impact of, and resistance to, the neoliberal ideology espoused by the World Bank and the IMF on Small Island Developing States. The thesis therefore contributes to the dearth of information on the welfare states in developing countries and highlights the importance of understanding the socio-political history, especially the role of colonialism, when assessing the emergence of social policy and planning in the global South. A thorough investigation of this period (1974 to 1994) was conducted, and the data collected from interviews and public archives disclosed that in times of crisis the social democratic welfare state model is challenged but it is the labour unions who strategically organise themselves to confront what they perceive as a movement away from the core principles of the model. They confront both the local policymakers and the international financial institutions. This study therefore demonstrates that even in difficult times some level of agency can still be expressed. This however, in the case of Barbados, did not happen at the level of the technocrats but from the level of organised labour. The case of the labour movement in Barbados, specifically the teachers’ unions (Barbados Union of Teachers and the Barbados Secondary Teachers’ Union) demonstrated that at the height of the neoliberal agenda organised labour was and still is significant in determining the direction of state policy.",1827508237,,Dissertations & Theses," Green, Donna L.GreenL.DonnaGreen, Donna L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209711141 , 103112772 , 101309 , 10177173 , 10177173 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/72937/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827508237?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/72937/ , (UMI)AAI10177173 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sustainability+of+the+social+democratic+welfare+state+in+recessionary+periods%3A+a+case+study+of+barbados+1974-1994&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Green%2C+Donna+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"739,Postcolonial Appetites: Vietnamese American Literature and Refugee Aesthetics,"This dissertation examines the crossing of global literary tastes and Vietnamese American culinary writing. Specifically, I argue that Vietnamese American writing illustrates how culinary and literary tastes serve as boundaries that define and manage racial expression across the colonial, anti-imperial, and neoliberal eras. As it is still a nascent genre, Vietnamese American writing has not yet been consolidated formally or critically, and therefore a new generation of writers and actors are actively experimenting with forms that will fuse the experience of refuge with the challenges faced in a racially charged United States. Through a close examination of various literary and cultural texts, I ask how, and, perhaps more importantly, why cuisine has become a popular organizing trope for these diasporic authors to work through the harsh legacies of the colonial project, the US intervention in Vietnam, and refugee life. Using a transnational and comparative approach, I demonstrate how Vietnamese American artists engage their own history of European and American domination by turning to gastronomic literature. I contend this literary movement seeks to reanimate the sensual loss experienced during wartime and the period of refuge in order to articulate a uniquely somatic brand of ""Vietnameseness"" that can travel across the globe. This literature responds to the commodification of western multiculturalism and the global desire for manageable ethnic difference by providing intimate cultural touchstones that make social positions intelligible without being completely translatable--resetting the terms of transnational cultural contact.",1835786247,,Dissertations & Theses," August, Timothy K.AugustK.TimothyAugust, Timothy K.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4238014281 , 108837612 , 66569 , 9781369080124 , 10152855 , 10152855", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781369080124, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835786247?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0401 Literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0401 Literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0401 Literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0401 Literature"," Comparative literature , Asian American Studies , Literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Food , Postcolonial studies , Vietnamese American literature , World literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Postcolonial+Appetites%3A+Vietnamese+American+Literature+and+Refugee+Aesthetics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=August%2C+Timothy+K.&amp;isbn=9781369080124&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"740,The politics of sociality: Social networks and indigenous mobilization in Peruvian Amazonia,"This dissertation examines the influence of social networks on political mobilization among indigenous people of Madre de Dios, in the southeastern Amazon lowlands of Peru. Since the early 1970s, an unprecedented rise in the international price of gold and oil, coupled with neoliberal policies that encouraged foreign investment in mining and oil extraction, spurred the arrival of transnational corporations and thousands of Andean settlers in the region, resulting in massive encroachment on indigenous lands. To defend their lands, indigenous Amazonians engaged in an ethnopolitical movement, a major expression of which has been the formation of an ethnic federation (FENAMAD). I explore the effects that networks based on kinship, friendship and patron-client relations have on indigenous people’s ability to mobilize resources and supporters, and build organizations. The study also analyzes how power and inequality permeate these networks, and how cultural values inform indigenous forms of political mobilization. To explore these issues, I conducted an ethnographic and historical study of FENAMAD and the Arakmbut community of Puerto Luz. Data were collected through ethnographic and life history interviews, participant observation, and archival research. The dissertation argues that sociality is at the base of Arakmbut’s reliance on social networks for political mobilization. In Arakmbut sociality, solidarity is not restricted to members of kin groups; it may be extended to outsiders through friendship, fictive kinship and patronage relations. While kinship networks were more important to facilitate community-based mobilization, alliance networks with anthropologists and human rights activists were more relevant in bringing autonomous kin groups and communities into larger multiethnic political organizations. Open acts of resistance were replaced by organized yet mostly hidden forms of defiance. The dissertation also concludes that social networks may also engender dilemmas between individual and collective interests, and reproduce existing gender and ethnic inequalities. Godparenthood networks with mining settlers, as well as patron-client ties with oil companies, created tensions within Arakmbut communities, hindering their capacity for collective action. Moreover, despite their crucial role in helping communities to get land titles and development projects, ethnic federations have been dominated by more acculturated, male-gendered indigenous elites.",1848269612,,Dissertations & Theses," Pinedo, Danny DavidPinedoDavidDannyPinedo, Danny David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4276888311 , 93418682 , 66569 , 9781369420661 , 10299043 , 10299043", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781369420661, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1848269612?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Harakmbut , Indigenous politics , Indigienous mobilization , Peruvian amazonia , Social networks , Social relations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+sociality%3A+Social+networks+and+indigenous+mobilization+in+Peruvian+Amazonia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pinedo%2C+Danny+David&amp;isbn=9781369420661&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"741,Fin-de-Siècle Diplomat: Chen Jitong (1852-1907) and Cosmopolitan Possibilities in the Late Qing World,"This dissertation explores Sino-Western interactions in the late Qing period through a biographical study of the diplomat-writer Chen Jitong (1852-1907). A flamboyant writer and self-appointed cultural mediator between China and France, Chen published, while serving as secretary in the Chinese legation in Paris in the 1880s, several books in French on Chinese culture and society. He also became a skilled public speaker at various learned societies and international congresses. In the last years of his life, Chen returned to China as a reformer, expectant official, and newspaper editor. With a colorful transnational life and career that was nevertheless heavily rooted in the late Qing self-strengthening and reform movements, Chen Jitong offers an exemplary case study for viability of late imperial Chinese literati culture in the modern world. Chapter 1 discusses the confluence of local literati culture and the opportunities opened for a generation of late-Qing cultural figures in the cosmopolitan environment surrounding the Fuzhou Navy Yard. Chapter 2 shows that in his writings, Chen employed an innovative mélange of classical Chinese texts and references to European literature to capture the uniqueness of Confucian values while also emphasizing the universality of human feelings and shared literary values. Chapter 3 analyzes the ways in which Chen’s public activities constituted a significant discursive and personal presence for China in fin-de-siècle Paris and at the 1889 Universal Expositions. Chapter 4 reconnects Chen to the late Qing milieu by retracing his involvement in a number of political and social projects upon his return to China. In mapping out Chen Jitong’s experiences as a cultural mediator and as a literatus-reformer, this study seeks to connect the dots between various studies of late Qing industrialization, social activism, cultural innovation, and political reform. It demonstrates that on the international stage, late Qing diplomats were highly conscious of their position not only as representatives of the Qing polity, but as bearers of Chinese civilization. Chen Jitong’s cross-cultural performance, in particular, is a reminder that the late nineteenth century was not only an age of imperialistic encroachment, but also a time of cosmopolitan encounters.",1859066326,,Dissertations & Theses," Ren, KeRenKeRen, Ke",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4303069341 , 110390522 , 66569 , 9781369476002 , 10302290 , 10302290", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781369476002, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1859066326?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history",," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," History , Modern history"," Social sciences , Cosmopolitanism , Jitong, Chen , Late qing dynasty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fin-de-Si%C3%A8cle+Diplomat%3A+Chen+Jitong+%281852-1907%29+and%0ACosmopolitan+Possibilities+in+the+Late+Qing+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ren%2C+Ke&amp;isbn=9781369476002&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"742,Sisters of separate spheres: The kindergarten movement in a different voice,"Limited affordable child care services in America is a perplexing one that engages political and philosophical debates (Beatty, 2004, Michels, 1986).

This paper is an ideological study of the journal articles written by women of the kindergarten movement in America from 1860 to 1960. Beginning with the primary documents of The International Kindergarten Union archives, this dissertation answers the following questions: To what extent did the women of the kindergarten movement embrace the ideologies of maternal pedagogy, progressive education and social justice? Utilizing grounded theory methodology, a new question emerged: To what extent did the kindergarten training schools influence teacher education? The advocacy efforts of the ""kindergarteners"", the self-named pioneers of the kindergarten movement is an informative one, narrating how American women took a European man's pedagogy and transformed it into an American phenomenon.",1880056021,,Dissertations & Theses," Greger, Wendy ElaineGregerElaineWendyGreger, Wendy Elaine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321092209 , 111378212 , 66569 , 9781369661040 , 10586592 , 10586592", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781369661040, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1880056021?accountid=14496, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history,, 0520 Education history, Education history," Education , Early Childhood , Elizabeth Harrison , Froebel , History , Kindergarten , Susan Blow",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sisters+of+separate+spheres%3A+The+kindergarten+movement+in+a%0Adifferent+voice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Greger%2C+Wendy+Elaine&amp;isbn=9781369661040&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"743,The Price of Freedom: Moral and Political Economies of the Global Anti-Trafficking Movement,"The global concern around human trafficking has provoked a transnational justice movement formally spearheaded in 2000 by the passing of the United Nations Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons. In 2008, the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Thailand introduced landmark policies that scripted the international language of human trafficking into their domestic legal frameworks. However, the difference in state-society relationships between post-socialist authoritarian China and free market democratic Thailand create a theoretically compelling comparison to answer my central research question: How do transnational social movements establish, institutionalize, and bridge power over relatively autonomous political authorities, markets, and over movement subjects? How do different factions of the movement mobilize resources in relation to the state and the market and how does the nature of institutional embeddedness affect whether they succeed, according to their stated objectives, or to the perceptions of their subjects? Based on 40 months of ethnographic participant observation with an anti-trafficking evangelical Christian social enterprise and global governance project in each country, this dissertation argues that despite global justice goals, faith-based and secular anti-trafficking organizations reproduce women's global subordination in different ways. American evangelical Christian rescue groups offer vocational training in jewelry making as alternative employment to sex work, and sell this jewelry as a slave-free commodity in the United States. The labor processes of vocational training are unique in Beijing and Bangkok due to disparate political economic circumstances in each country: vocational training in China embodies the character of the authoritarian state, while the working conditions in Thailand resemble those of free market firms. In the Chinese secular case, state control emerges as the primary mechanism of anti-trafficking intervention through the creation of a government ministry to address human trafficking. Global governance institutions like the United Nations must work exclusively through selective partnerships with Chinese government organs, which causes the transnational movement to strengthen state control over labor, gender, and migrant rights. In Thailand's free market and democratic monarchy, international pressures to forge an aggressive anti-trafficking response to sex and labor trafficking have resulted in a multi-tiered rescue industry involving the private sector, NGOs, transnational advocacy networks, and new government anti-trafficking entities. The transnational rescue industry in Thailand similarly subjects low wage women workers to new and unregulated forms of scrutiny, surveillance and forced detention alongside the government's support of sex tourism and aquaculture exports as primary engines of growth. Overall, the transnational anti-trafficking movement has embodied the characteristics of authoritarian state power in China, and the free market in Thailand.",1651239688,,Dissertations & Theses," Shih, ElenaShihElenaShih, Elena",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3579326661 , 93788292 , 66569 , 9781321481143 , 3671041 , 3671041", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321481143, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1651239688?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0700 Social structure",," 0344 Social research , 0700 Social structure"," Social research , Social structure"," Social sciences , China , Human trafficking , Labor movements , Sex worker rights , Thailand , Transnational social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Price+of+Freedom%3A+Moral+and+Political+Economies+of+the+Global+Anti-Trafficking+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shih%2C+Elena&amp;isbn=9781321481143&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"744,"Power, Oppression, and Group Difference Interrogation: A Call to Social Justice Movement Organizations","Especially since the ""new social movements"" of the 1960s and 1970s, the complexities of group status difference and oppression have posed major challenges to social movements aimed at justice and equality. This paper explores the potential for social movement organizations to approach race, class, gender, and sexuality in ways that resist essentialized identities and expose and challenge the dynamics of power by which structural oppression operates. Focusing on the Washington Peace Center–a social movement organization in the District of Columbia–as a case study, I utilize qualitative, oral history interviews to illuminate the process of group difference interrogation and anti-oppression activism over time. I find that justice-seeking social movements– through an attention to standpoint, openness to the claims of other social movements, and proper consideration of the connection between local, national, and global issues–are capable of meaningful engagement across group difference that undermines complex and interrelated oppressions.",1654777684,,Dissertations & Theses," Arens, Jennifer L.ArensL.JenniferArens, Jennifer L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3588584851 , 91694182 , 66569 , 9781321529272 , 1582906 , 1582906", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321529272, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1654777684?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Social structure , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Anti-oppression , Class , Gender , Race , Social justice , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Power%2C+Oppression%2C+and+Group+Difference+Interrogation%3A+A+Call+to+Social+Justice+Movement+Organizations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arens%2C+Jennifer+L.&amp;isbn=9781321529272&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"745,"Political Harvests: Transnational Farmers' Movements in North Dakota and Saskatchewan, 1905-1950","This research uses as a case study farmers' movements in North Dakota and Saskatchewan, two identical locales in terms of wheat monoculture, demographics, and agrarian ideology, and traces the differing social, economic, and political outcomes between 1905 and 1950. The research, however, moves beyond this and also investigates the transnational integration, connections, and engagements among agrarian groups across the broader North American northern plains and across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to Europe, the Soviet Union, and Australia. Methodologically, this study applies social movement theory, pioneered by sociologists Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilley, which seeks to replace a static view of social movements with a more dynamic one and allows for baseline comparison and elucidation of cross-border interactions. This investigation utilizes personal and organizational papers, along with movement newspapers and other movement publications from archives in the United States and Canada. For the first time, this research delves deeply into the shared histories of the U.S.-Canadian northern plains—and movements' relationships with similar agrarian histories around the globe—and takes the story from the late nineteenth century through the tumult of the Great Depression, when the divergent paths of farmers' movements began, and into the early Cold War period, when two distinct political outcomes became apparent.",1664611634,,Dissertations & Theses," McCollom, JasonMcCollomJasonMcCollom, Jason",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3629300111 , 94836502 , 66569 , 9781321620092 , 3685658 , 3685658", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321620092, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1664611634?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history",," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," Canadian history , American history"," Social sciences , Charles Tilley , Doug McAdam , Farming , Sidney Tarrow , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+Harvests%3A+Transnational+Farmers%27+Movements+in+North+Dakota+and+Saskatchewan%2C+1905-1950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCollom%2C+Jason&amp;isbn=9781321620092&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"746,Postcolonial homophobia: United States imperialism in Haiti and the transnational circulation of antigay sexual politics,"This dissertation develops a theory of postcolonial homophobia based on archival research and multi-sited ethnographic research in Haiti and its diaspora between 2008 and 2014. Postcolonial homophobia refers to the way that Euro-American imperialist discourses construct postcolonial nations as simultaneously too queer (resistant to modernity) and too homophobic (failed modernity), which respectively emerge from two transnational social movements, evangelical Christianity and global LGBTQI human rights. The dissertation demonstrates that the interplay of these discourses produces negative material effects for postcolonial subjects, including those under the signs of LGBT and other queer terms (e.g., masisi, madivin, makomé, bisex, omoseksyèl, trani ). The six chapters provide detailed accounts of the effects of postcolonial homophobia in Haiti: cyclical outbreaks of homophobic violence, depoliticization of anti-imperialist resistance, and justification of foreign interventions.",1682266155,,Dissertations & Theses," Durban-Albrecht, Erin L.Durban-AlbrechtL.ErinDurban-Albrecht, Erin L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3691124591 , 96231872 , 66569 , 9781321732481 , 3702125 , 3702125", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321732481, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1682266155?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , GLBT Studies"," Social sciences , Haiti , Imperialism , Queer , Racialized sexuality , Social movements , United states",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Postcolonial+homophobia%3A+United+States+imperialism+in+Haiti+and+the+transnational+circulation+of+antigay+sexual+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gomes%2C+Carmen+Luiza+Geitosa+de+Lima&amp;isbn=9781124849959&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"747,Privacy As Trust: Sharing Personal Information in a Networked World,"Global data networks pose potential dangers to personal privacy by making much of our information available for others to see. Our credit card numbers, names and addresses, prescription drug histories, intimate photographs, and even our movements along city streets are subject to relatively easy surveillance through network technologies. This thesis addresses a threat to privacy occasioned by modern life in a networked world: since limited disclosure of certain personal information is often necessary to participate in modern social, commercial, and professional life, under what circumstances, if any, can we retain privacy rights in information previously disclosed? The answer is explored through a sociological lens and concludes that, under certain circumstances, disclosures in contexts of trust are private. Traditional conceptualizations of what it means for something to be private and legally protected as such are inadequate to respond to the challenges stemming from technological advancement. Developed over time and influenced by inherent political and philosophical biases, conventional theories of privacy actually endanger our rights in a world where privacy invasions are more frequent, less avoidable, and damaging. Reorienting legal analysis of invasions of privacy around principles of trust would protect personal privacy in the modern world. Ultimately, this thesis argues that disclosures made in contexts of trust that give rise to obligations of confidence and discretion are not truly made public and, therefore, should retain legal protection as private. And trust, evidence presented shows, is not limited to close relationships among intimates or legally-defined relationships; trust extends to relationships and social connections based on several social factors, including strong overlapping networks, identity sharing, and experience. The locus of theoretical inquiry is primarily the effects of the internet on privacy and how to solve the problem of limited disclosures. In this respect, the main contribution of this thesis is the articulation of social trust as a basis for drawing the line between what is public and what is private. The locus of empirical inquiry is Facebook, an online social network platform that is used not as a perfect proxy for all social interactions and disclosures, but as a case study to highlight the problems of modern social interaction, its effects on personal privacy, and the role of trust in at least some decisions to share personal information. Here, the thesis's main contribution is the study of how trust in others, including strangers, influences sharing on an online social network and the identification of social indicia of trust that inspires sharing. The recommendations are legal, spanning tort, constitutional, and intellectual property law, providing both scholars and judges with theoretical and practical tools for strengthening privacy during technology's remarkable journey forward.",1682266288,,Dissertations & Theses," Waldman, Ari EzraWaldmanEzraAriWaldman, Ari Ezra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3691127411 , 92774642 , 66569 , 9781321700602 , 3700208 , 3700208", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321700602, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1682266288?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology",," 0398 Law , 0626 Sociology"," Law , Sociology"," Social sciences , Facebook , Fourth amendment , Intellectual property , Internet , Privacy , Sharing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privacy+As+Trust%3A+Sharing+Personal+Information+in+a+Networked+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Waldman%2C+Ari+Ezra&amp;isbn=9781321700602&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"748,Contesting the future of the &lt;i&gt;campo Mexicano&lt;/i&gt;: Food sovereignty and the cultural politics of transgenic corn,"This dissertation analyzes the social-spatial knowledge practices that have emerged in the controversy over genetically modified (GM) transgenic corn in Mexico. This controversy is embedded within a broader struggle over the future of global food production and consumption, as the idea of agrobiotechnology as a techno-fix to global climate change and hunger increasingly takes over the popular imagination. The concept of food sovereignty, as developed within the Vía Campesina social movement, has emerged as a powerful discursive alternative on this terrain. Mexico is one of the most active sites of dispute over the future and meaning of maize and small-scale farming in North America. Through ethnographic and discursive engagement with the key social movement network that has emerged ""in defense of maize"" in Mexico, this dissertation analyzes the practices that have worked to generate autonomy and alternative geographies of territory and justice in the struggle over transgenic maize between the years 2009 and 2014. The complexity of intertwined cultural and biological processes that give rise to agrobiodiversity make studying the cultural politics of maize and the rearticulation of agrarian progress particularly relevant in maize's ""center of origin."" This project describes and analyzes three specific, concrete sets of world-making practices taking place at different sites of struggle against transgenic corn in Mexico: testing, mapping, and the international Permanent People's Tribunal. These practices emerged in moments of crisis—of contamination, of defining the centers of origin of maize, and of state impunity—framed within the larger discourse of crisis that sees rural Mexico as under ""attack"" by the Mexican government, starting with the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s. Each site of struggle has changed the terms of resistance through experimentation, specifically generating practices of autonomy and multiplicity.",1685033906,,Dissertations & Theses," Wilson, Alice BrookeWilsonBrookeAliceWilson, Alice Brooke",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3702285901 , 96488622 , 66569 , 9781321761566 , 3704014 , 3704014", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321761566, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685033906?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Agrobiotechnology , Knowledge practices , Maize , Mexico , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+the+future+of+the+campo+Mexicano%3A%0AFood+sovereignty+and+the+cultural+politics+of+transgenic+corn&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+Alice+Brooke&amp;isbn=9781321761566&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"749,Intellectual Property and the Knowledge Economy's Global Division of Labor: Producing Taiwanese Green-Technology Between the United States and China,"The social scientific study of globalization's increasing flows of commodities, financing, knowledge, media, and people has been a productive ground for investigating changing connections among geographically distant people and their consequences. In spite of this recent focus on movement and flows, however, I suggest that our knowledge of globalization is incomplete without an understanding of the infrastructures of stoppage that underlie and determine the ongoing shape and directionalities of that movement. This dissertation lays out an argument for patents as one such critical legal infrastructure of global stoppage that provides unique insight into the changing roles and challenges confronting China and Taiwan within global systems of production, consumption, creativity, and copying. The dissertation's ethnography of patents in practice is based on 20 months of fieldwork on the production of technological knowledge and property in it within a Taiwanese LED (light emitting diode) company that produces patents between Taiwan and the United States and products between Taiwan and China. I argue that the processes by which knowledge is extracted and translated from the lab to the law decouples the knowledge from its origins in machines, materials, and engineers. This decoupling enables patents to circulate separately from these and provides owners with new control over global flows of engineers, tangible commodities, and usable knowledge. Alongside my Taiwanese interlocutors, I argue that patents are best understood as weapons of competition: more similar to non-disclosure agreements or aggressive pricing tactics than copyright or other forms of “intellectual property.” As weapons, the deployment of patents encourages the production of new patents much more than it does technological innovation. As they are currently practiced, patents therefore enable flows, but do so only in particular directions. It is through this stoppage that high tech patents create and maintain global divisions of labor, profit, and environmental risk.",1685035644,,Dissertations & Theses," West, Matthew E.WestE.MatthewWest, Matthew E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3702310701 , 92775132 , 66569 , 9781321739770 , 3702572 , 3702572", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321739770, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685035644?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0513 Intellectual Property"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0513 Intellectual Property"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0513 Intellectual Property",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0513 Intellectual Property"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Intellectual Property"," Social sciences , China , Circulation , Environmentalism , Globalization , Green technology , Intellectual property , Knowledge economy , Patents , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intellectual+Property+and+the+Knowledge+Economy%27s+Global+Division+of+Labor%3A+Producing+Taiwanese+Green-Technology+Between+the+United+States+and+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=West%2C+Matthew+E.&amp;isbn=9781321739770&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"750,The rhetoric of philanthropy: Scientific charity as moral language,"To take at face value the current enthusiasm at the idea of marshaling science to end human social ills such as global poverty, one could easily overlook the fact that one hundred fifty years prior people were making strikingly similar claims as part of a broad movement often referred to as ""scientific charity"" or ""scientific philanthropy"". The goal of this dissertation is to contribute to our knowledge of the scientific charity movement, through a retrieval of the morally weighted language used by reformers and social scientists to justify the changes they proposed for both public and private provision of poor relief, as found in the Proceedings of the Annual Assembly of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections (NCCC). In essence I am claiming that our understanding of the scientific charity movement is incomplete, and can be improved by an approach that looks at scientific charity as a species of moral language that provided ways to energize the many disparate and seemingly disconnected or even contradictory movements found during the period under study. The changes enacted to late 19th century philanthropic and charitable structures did not occur due to advances in a morally neutral and thus superior science, but were born along by a broad scale use of the language of scientific charity: an equally moral yet competing and eventually more compelling vision of a philanthropic future which held the keys to unlock the mysteries of poverty and solve it once and for all. When viewing scientific charity as something broader than any particular instantiation of it, when pursing it as a set of languages used to promote social science's role in solving human problems by discrediting prior non-scientific attempts, one can begin to see that the reformist energies of late 19th century social thinkers did not dissipate, but crystalized into the set of background assumptions still present today.",1689691481,,Dissertations & Theses," Klopp, Richard LeeKloppLeeRichardKlopp, Richard Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3719344091 , 96986642 , 66569 , 9781321758825 , 3703829 , 3703829", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321758825, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689691481?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0402 Philosophy of Science , 0578 History"," 0344 Social research , 0402 Philosophy of Science , 0578 History"," 0344 Social research , 0402 Philosophy of Science , 0578 History",," 0344 Social research , 0402 Philosophy of Science , 0578 History"," Social research , Philosophy of Science , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Assa , Ncsw , Sanborn , Scientific charity , Scientific philanthropy , Social science",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+rhetoric+of+philanthropy%3A+Scientific+charity+as+moral+language&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klopp%2C+Richard+Lee&amp;isbn=9781321758825&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"751,"The Beyul campaign: Spatial articulations of territory and religion in Khumbu, Nepal","Increasingly, non-governmental organizations and social movements, ranging from the local to global in scale, are mobilizing sacred landscapes—intimate, yet contested and politically charged lifeworlds and expressions of beliefs—to support environmental conservation programs, development agendas, and indigenous peoples' territorial claims. Yet, such mobilizations often essentialize and depoliticize understandings of such landscapes as well as human-environment relations in such places. The purpose of this research was to investigate the ways in which the concept of sacred landscape works to shape articulations between global movements and local concerns, with specific attention to the role of space, and multiple spatialities, in such processes. In Nepal, constructions of sacred landscapes embody enunciations of indigenous identity and territoriality produced out of articulations between global environmental and development discourses and localized political and social agendas. Despite the seemingly fertile ground for articulations between the concept of Khumbu as a beyul —a sacred valley in the Nyingma Tibetan Buddhist tradition—and global discourses of environmental conservation, development, and indigenous politics, Khumbu Sherpa informants, outside of a small group of academic elites and community leaders, were indifferent toward mobilizing the beyul concept to support environmental conservation and development, or as the basis for a territorial claim in Nepal's indigenous rights movement. I used qualitative methodologies to explore Khumbu Sherpas' relations with Khumbu as an animate territory, how those relations are performed through everyday practices and rituals, and the disconnections between those relations and local concerns over environmental conservation, development, and indigenous rights. I show that the beyul concept produces an ideological space that lacks reference to the material and everyday spaces Khumbu Sherpas produce through practices and rituals maintaining relationships with localized deities and spirits. Further, I find that the spaces produced by the state and through tourism and mountaineering buffer Khumbu Sherpas from the political and economic marginalization driving participation in Nepal's indigenous rights movement among some other groups in Nepal. I conclude that the multiple spaces produced in Khumbu have worked to disrupt the development of the specific indigenous and territorial consciousness necessary for the space of the beyul to enunciate in Khumbu.",1690497207,,Dissertations & Theses," Skog, Lindsay AnnSkogAnnLindsaySkog, Lindsay Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3723407811 , 97081102 , 66569 , 9781321774214 , 3704812 , 3704812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321774214, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690497207?accountid=14496," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Religion , Philosophy , Geography , South Asian Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Beyul campaign , Khumbu, nepal , Religion , Spatial articulations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Beyul+campaign%3A+Spatial+articulations+of+territory+and+religion+in+Khumbu%2C+Nepal&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perez-Lewis%2C+Keila+Lizth&amp;isbn=9781339524863&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"752,Twitter and mainstream media discourses of a social movement: An exploratory case study of the Indian anti-corruption movement of 2011,"This dissertation explores the complex interaction of social media, print media and testimonies from participant-organizers in the context of the Anna Hazare anti-corruption movement in 2011 in India. Drawing on social movement studies, Internet studies, media and cultural studies, political science, history, and postcolonial studies, I qualitatively analyze the discourses and representations of the Hazare anti-corruption movement in three primary datasets: Twitter feeds for five peak days in the movement, coverage of the movement in two pan-national English-language newspapers, the Times of India and Hindustan Times, and interviews with eight participant-organizers. My study reveals that the public discourses in mainstream Indian media on the constructions of the Hazare movement reflected the aspirations of the English-speaking middle classes in India. In articulating the significance of the movement, discourses emerging from the media stories, Twitter feeds, and movement participants made strong references to the linkages and interpenetrations of the Indian freedom struggle and Gandhi, connecting questions of corruption to frames of nationalism and patriotism. I argue that the Hazare movement was both a product, as well as, an agent of revival of Gandhism in popular Indian imaginary. Finally, the analysis of Twitter feeds illustrate that there were four main overlapping functions of tweets: as an imagined community, providing manufactured solidarity, evoking Gandhi-Hazare comparisons, and using humor as resistance to Hazare movement narratives. Twitter influenced political discourse and served as a public space for users to articulate their ideas and opinions during the Hazare movement. I argue that the formulation of corruption as a moral issue, a moral struggle waged by the patriotic citizenry of India, was a master discourse that linked all the other discourses of the Hazare movement. Corruption in the Hazare movement was personified by the ""inefficient"" political class, the ""other,"" ""the scourge"" that was getting in the way of global India's aspirations.

In 2005, the world’s first public health treaty – the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) – was brought into force by the World Health Organization (WHO). Unanimously adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2003, the FCTC has since become one of the most widely and rapidly adopted treaties in the history of the United Nations. The success of the treaty is frequently attributed to its “unequivocal evidence base” and, as a result, the FCTC is frequently seen primarily as a technical accomplishment. However, the evidence base of global tobacco control has been built on a very particular economic valuing of human life that emerged with the introduction of the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) metric by the World Bank in 1993. The development of the DALY metric, coupled with organizational reconfigurations in the field of world health, instantiated cost-effectiveness as a dominant logic and enabled tobacco control to rise to prominence on the WHO’s agenda. At the same time, the international movement for tobacco control began to gain traction as new political and discursive opportunity structures arose amidst WHO reform during the last 1990s. The dissertation argues that the accomplishment of the FCTC is much more than an evidence-based technical accomplishment: it represents the institutionalization of a new way of quantifying disease, economizing life and governing health on a global scale and a key moment in the transition from a post-war configuration of international health to the contemporary neoliberal global health order. Drawing on a range of textual sources, participant observations and interviews with key actors, the dissertation attends to the economization of life by tracing the epistemological, social and political dimensions of the development of the FCTC treaty. Its findings contribute to interdisciplinary scholarship on the history of world health, critical studies of global health and social studies of the relationship between science and policy – or between knowledge and power – including science and technology studies, biopolitics and social studies of globalization and postcolonialism.",1696286617,,Dissertations & Theses," Kenny, Katherine ElizabethKennyElizabethKatherineKenny, Katherine Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3743581931 , 97445582 , 66569 , 9781321826883 , 3707851 , 3707851", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321826883, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1696286617?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history , 0626 Sociology"," 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history , 0626 Sociology"," 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history , 0626 Sociology",," 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history , 0626 Sociology"," Public health , Science history , Sociology"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Biopolitics , Coproduction , Global health , Governmentality , Tobacco control , World health",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Governing+Global+Health%3A+Knowledge+and+power+in+the+global+tobacco+epidemic&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kenny%2C+Katherine+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781321826883&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"754,The organization of indigenous resistance to neoliberal extractive industry development in the Cordillera of the northern Philippines,"Over the past half-century, the Philippines has experienced great social changes as social movements have arisen in response to the national government's aggressive implementation of neoliberal development policies. The recent history of the Philippines features an illustrious culture of mass-based organization, as local populations protest national development strategies that promote rapid economic growth and integration into world markets at the expense of local social and environmental concerns. Specifically, an anti-large scale mining social movement in the Philippines has developed in reaction to the liberalization of the national mining industry with the Mining Act of 1995, which opened the country's rich mineral resources to 100 percent ownership by foreign corporations. Through the development of a protest movement against such neoliberal policies, local communities and their regional, national and international representative organizations have coalesced around the promotion of indigenous identity, stressing the environmental and economic rights guaranteed to indigenous peoples by the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997. In promoting such rights, these agents strive to continue to develop local mining industries and profit from local lands and resources, which indigenous communities have practiced and exploited since time immemorial. Ultimately, the anti-large scale mining movement struggles to maintain an identity as a social movement protesting the globalization of natural resource exploitation, while promoting the rights of indigenous natural resource exploitation. The research focuses on Baguio City in Benguet Province of the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Northern Philippines and investigates the challenges of organizing social movements to bring local, indigenous concerns into the national and international development and environmentalist discourses.",1696781854,,Dissertations & Theses," Bulanda, RobertBulandaRobertBulanda, Robert",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3745052751 , 97575522 , 66569 , 9781321813968 , 1590997 , 1590997", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321813968, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1696781854?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+organization+of+indigenous+resistance+to+neoliberal+extractive+industry+development+in+the+Cordillera+of+the+northern+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bulanda%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=9781321813968&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"755,"Early Collective Action and Social Movements in Cyberspace. The Transformation of Political Culture through Contentious Practices of Silence, Disruption, and Acting in Concert","Cyberactivism and a diversity of related concepts are seen as forms of contentious politics that have shaped the social movements of the Information Society. This dissertation analyzes how these forms of social activism, have evolved from early political repertoires of silencing and disrupting communication (hacktivism) to more sophisticated and productive practices, culminating in the manifestation of concerted action in the virtual public space. It examines the developing transfer of traditional tactics of social activism to the realm of cyberspace, and how cyberactivism has impacted the political culture of our times. This dissertation explores what it means to ""act in concert"" in cyberspace. It is concerned with the political uses of the Internet and digital communication technologies, which provide a public space that facilitates activism and social movements. It makes analytical distinctions between direct actions and early form of Internet activism, and the day-to-day interactions that stimulate the development of a new political culture and that advance the possibility that small actions can transform the social frame in which they are inscribed. This research critically analyzes the virtual practices of politics through the comparison of three key examples of activism in cyberspace: a) The early stage of strategic silences, analyzed through the actions of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, a group that developed the virtual sit-in (also known as DoS attacks) as an action of electronic civil disobedience in 1998. b) The early struggle to act in concert through the orchestration of the so-called anti-globalization protests against the World Trade Organization in 1999, combining media and ECD groups with street protests. Among the groups responsible for the digital activism of this protest, this dissertation focuses on the Electrohippies Collective, a group of activists based in Great Britain c) Later actions that provide spaces for actors to engage in discursive activities in the blogosphere, specifically the Global Voices project, which focuses on blogging and the spread of information, and on practices of e-advocacy that are best exemplified by cyberactivism related to the pro-democracy conflict in Myanmar (Burma). This dissertation provides a critical account of virtual activism, exploring its developing social meaningfulness. While recognizing the danger of a ""comfortable"" activism, it acknowledges the need to rethink political activity in a way that is suited to the changing social model of the information society.",1698252671,,Dissertations & Theses," Alfaro, VeronicaAlfaroVeronicaAlfaro, Veronica",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3753039381 , 97595432 , 66569 , 9781321885521 , 3712017 , 3712017", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321885521, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1698252671?accountid=14496," 0489 Information Technology , 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies"," 0489 Information Technology , 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies"," 0489 Information Technology , 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies",," 0489 Information Technology , 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies"," Information Technology , Sociology , Web Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Cyberactivism , Information age , Information and communication technologies , Politics , Social movements , Virtual sit-in",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Early+Collective+Action+and+Social+Movements+in+Cyberspace.+The+Transformation+of+Political+Culture+through+Contentious+Practices+of+Silence%2C+Disruption%2C+and+Acting+in+Concert&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alfaro%2C+Veronica&amp;isbn=9781321885521&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"756,African immigrants in Tokyo: Transnational performative identities and spaces of belonging,"Research on transnationalism in the social sciences has grown tremendously over the past several decades. Ethnographic case studies have especially made important contributions to transnational literature, however focus has been mainly upon migration flows to the United States and Europe. In the past few decades Japan has experienced an economic and cultural boom followed by subsequent a decline and stagnation. It faces an aging population outnumbering the young. Extremely low birth rates have raised issues regarding how Japan will care for its elderly and provide social security, how it will make an economic recovery without young people and their labor. In addition to these changes, Japan has become a country of immigration with no standardized means of accepting and integrating its oldest as well as most recent diverse immigrants. This dissertation explores the experience of Africans, one of the recent immigrant groups, in contemporary Tokyo, and the impact these transnational movements have on immigrants’ identities and their host country. My ethnographic analysis draws upon diaspora studies, transnational theory, Japan studies and diaspora studies. I provide an outline of existing scholarship on immigrants in Japan and their legal acceptance and cultural integration (or lack of integration) into Japanese national social identity discourse.

Additional African, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern migrants and asylum-seekers further changed the social landscape of the nation-state. Due in part to negative media representation of Muslims, German societal perceptions of ""ethnic Muslim"" migrants' macro-political integration remain low despite increasing education levels and language competence among migrant descendants. Hamburg's culture bureau funds integration programs that foster intercultural and international exchanges and subsequently bridge migrants and ""ethnic Germans."" Founded in 2007, the Hamburg HipHop Academy transmits shared ethics through hip-hop courses. Students who demonstrate discipline, respect, punctuality, and determination can micro-politically integrate into the Academy and ascend the ranks to the elite Ensemble. Once part of this community of practice, youth act as cultural ambassadors for Germany and Hamburg and display the macro-political integration of migrant descendants through dance theater productions. Based on participant observation and interviews I completed during 2011-2014 with present and former Academy students, trainers, parents, and administrators, integration workers and community members, this dissertation analyzes youth recognition of and responses to the city's use of hip-hop as a tool of social integration, discipline, and soft power, outlining how the Academy's intervention in and censorship of youth self-expression affect their participation, feelings of belonging, sensory memories, and performance. Increasingly, the Academy focuses on training youth to be professional artists and transforming hip-hop from a protest art form into Hochkultur (high culture). I argue that the Academy's transmission of ethics via micro-political integration and censored performances of macro-political integration benefit the city-state's presentation as a cohesive, globally-oriented civic society but impede participants' artistic freedom to sample hybrid identities through sound and movement. Although the Academy produces bonding social capital by bringing migrant youth together, bridging with people from different social backgrounds via the Academy is minimal and primarily occurs through the international exchanges of the Ensemble and Showgruppen (show groups). Looking forward, social integration programs that utilize culture should emphasize bridging and double-sided integration and should encourage rather than suppress participants' abilities to sample their unique identities through artistic expression.",1699085470,,Dissertations & Theses," Rothchild, Emily JoyRothchildJoyEmilyRothchild, Emily Joy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3759215301 , 97951602 , 66569 , 9781321851793 , 3709548 , 3709548", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321851793, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1699085470?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0615 Political science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0615 Political science"," Cultural anthropology , Music , Political science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Hip-hop , Migration , Muslims , Sensory memory , Social integration , Soft power",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sampled+identities%3A+The+micro-+and+macro-political+integration+of+migrant+descendants+at+the+Hamburg+HipHop+Academy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rothchild%2C+Emily+Joy&amp;isbn=9781321851793&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"758,Paraliterary Institutions,"Paraliterary Institutions argues that literary fiction played a crucial role in the creation of U.S. institutions of cross-cultural exchange From 1945 to 1976, dozens of state, civic, and economic institutions were founded on the idea that carefully stylized communication between American citizens and international audiences could lead to an enduring global liberalism. More often than not, such institutions tasked fiction writers with articulating new practices of international communication and interaction. William Faulkner chaired Dwight D. Eisenhower's People-to-People Initiative; F.O. Matthiessen and Alfred Kazin served as the architects for Senator J. William Fulbright's eponymous Fulbright Program; Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Gordon Parks launched the Franco-American Fellowship to encourage a distinctly black internationalism; and in the writings of participants, ranging from Mary McCarthy to Sylvia Plath to the Beat coterie, practices of international communication helped to globalize the themes and forms of American fiction. These institutions were more than just foreign policy innovations. They were sites in which writers, working as ambassadors, administrators, advertisers, and secret agents, could define-the role that language played in national representation. I propose a historical connection between these writers' fictional representations—of speech, gesture, bodily movement, sensory perception, and social interaction—and the actions and interactions they imagined real people could perform. Drawing from theorists of interaction like Dean MacCannell, Erving Go man, Gilbert Lyle, Bernard Lahire, and Bruno Latour, I view these institutions as scenes where distinction between an autonomous literary field and the social, political, or economic aspects of human experience. Nor do they treat the institutions they inhabit as stable systems or fixed sets of rules that prescribe specific creative practices. Rather, they assemble their own conditions of reading and writing fiction: conditions of literary reception, as well as literary production. It is in these processes of institutional assembly and social uncertainty that I find the most complex and nuanced attempts by writers to account for the way that literary texts work and what they can make happen.",1701634093,,Dissertations & Theses," Emre, Merve GulEmreGulMerveEmre, Merve Gul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3769239931 , 98119912 , 66569 , 9781321941234 , 3663525 , 3663525", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321941234, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1701634093?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology",," 0591 American literature , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology"," American literature , International Relations , Sociology"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Diplomacy , Fiction , Institutions , Post War , Race , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Paraliterary+Institutions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Emre%2C+Merve+Gul&amp;isbn=9781321941234&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"759,Natural resource revolutions: Mexico and Cuba within the sphere of U.S. hegemony,"The improbable trajectories of Mexico and Cuba give rise to compelling questions: in what ways have the revolutionary governments of Mexico and Cuba been able to practice successful defiance of the United States hegemon of the twentieth century? And how has that defiance helped to define U.S. foreign policy in Latin America? This dissertation presents a detailed examination of the contexts surrounding both the Mexican and Cuban Revolutions and their struggle against imperialist-driven interventions by the United States in Latin America and the Caribbean. I argue that through strategic decisions, the Mexican and Cuban revolutionary governments were able to ward off U.S. intervention and create a process of independence that in turn became a trajectory for defiance in modern Latin America and the Caribbean through revolution, petroleum nationalization, and the establishment of a strong party system that harnessed the power of social movements through public buy-in to revolutionary principles. The theoretical underpinnings of this Latin American Studies interdisciplinary dissertation incorporates Immanuel Wallerstein's World Systems Theory, which provides a perspective on the development of imperialism and the rise of neoliberal free-market capitalism through an examination of the developmental processes of former dependent and colonial territories. Additionally, I use the approach developed by Theda Skocpol in Social Revolutions in the Modern World to inform the comparative historical method. I emphasize Skocpol's theories of social revolution that stress the importance of geopolitical relations during twentieth century revolutions. I also incorporate Charles Tilly's theory of social movements and Max Weber's concept of charismatic authority. Bringing these diverse theoretical traditions into productive dialogue through my analysis, I develop the concept of ""natural resource revolutions:"" a concept that can illustrate the mechanisms that bring together organized groups to challenge local and international pressures and coercive historical relations that favor local and international elites. I also develop ""charismatic revolutionary leadership"" as a conceptual tool from which to view the national and global social forces shaping the success of social movements that aims to liberate national resources from imperial hegemony around the globe. Through ""charismatic revolutionary leadership,"" Lázaro Cárdenas and Fidel Castro were successful because there were institutional dynamics inherent in revolution that facilitated the nationalist implementation of natural resource sovereignty. Specifically, they both came into power on the heels of the institutionalization of radical constitutions, strong social movements, and effective political party formation. And finally, the Mexican and Cuban Revolutions birthed constitutions that created the legal precedent for implementing national sovereignty as a new goal for their reconstituted political structures. The contributions of this dissertation are significant because they link theories of world systems and social revolutions in the modern world to social movements and the dynamics of charismatic authority to what took place in Latin America during the 1930s and 1960s vis-à-vis the use of natural resource nationalization as a diplomatic weapon. It is my hope that these empirical and theoretical contributions can be used to explore the dynamics between the United States and other world powers throughout Latin America and the Caribbean and go on to inform research into other core and periphery country relationships.",1707355044,,Dissertations & Theses," Garcia, Joseph J.GarciaJ.JosephGarcia, Joseph J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3788647771 , 98604852 , 66569 , 9781321878622 , 3711568 , 3711568", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321878622, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707355044?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," Latin American history , Latin American Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cuba , Mexico , Nationalization , Petroleum , Revolution , Sovereignty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Natural+resource+revolutions%3A+Mexico+and+Cuba+within+the+sphere+of+U.S.+hegemony&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garcia%2C+Joseph+J.&amp;isbn=9781321878622&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"760,The transnational politics of democratization: Human rights in South Korea and US-Korean relations in the 1970,"This dissertation analyzes how South Korean domestic conflicts on democratization became internationalized in the 1970s within the framework of the global upsurge of interests in human rights. It argues that domestic disputes became part and parcel of the global politics of human rights; in this frame, a transnational coalition for social, political, and economic justice developed that challenged US Cold War security policy. The dissertation operates at two levels: it emphasizes the impact of local human rights issues for domestic and international affairs; it also highlights how human rights actions and counter-actions emerged on the international stage and assumed geopolitical significance, particularly in the context of US Cold War foreign policy. Over all, it highlights local democratic actors' constitutive roles in shaping global human rights talks and activism that involved the transnational politics of human rights in Korea. The dissertation shows three inter-related points. First, pro-democratic actors in Korea actively mobilized the language of human rights to garner international support. To fit local needs, they also pragmatically appropriated global human rights initiatives. Despite Amnesty International's pioneering roles, local democratic actors increasingly built up substantial connections with ecumenical groups for politically-oriented and comprehensive campaigns. Second, instead of the United Nations, Washington became the epicenter for transnational contestations as both protestors and repressors utilized human rights issues to maximize their respective agenda in international politics. In parallel with the US Congress' moralist campaigns, the Nixon, Ford, and even Carter administrations deployed Kissinger's counter-mobilization mechanism. Third, the US administrations' consistent practice for the Cold War security stability seriously backfired, culminating in the tragic May 1980 massacre at Kwangju.

There is an increasing recognition on the fact that civil society plays a significant role in conflict management and peace-building by participating, engaging and educating the grass roots. This thesis analyzes the role of the transnational Hizmet movement's initiatives in combatting radicalism and the establishment of peace in conflict-ridden societies through its case studies, which include Afghanistan, Bosnia, Northern Iraq, Southeast Turkey and the Philippines. Examined are the effectiveness and impact of the educational and dialogic models and activities practiced at the Hizmet movement schools in relation to the implementation of peace-building and counter-radicalization strategies. As a civic society, the Hizmet movement utilizes social capital in order to alleviate ethno-religious divisions in heterogeneous multi-ethnic communities around the world, and strives to provide the basic pre-conditions for a peace-oriented society to emerge from those communities. Within the disciplines of international relations, political science and peace studies, approaches including conflict prevention and conflict resolution examine the sources of conflict with the intention of understanding the roots of the problem as well as how to avoid, eradicate and prevent violence. As an effective theory of conflict studies, the Human Development approach involves public policy agenda and takes into account the social, political and economic aspects of the societies' requirements completely, notably, the progress towards betterment of quality of life. This approach can establish linkages and correlations between political and social failure, as well as success in dealing with problems like conflict and radicalism. In the light of the human development theory, the thesis argues that the Hizmet movement's educational and social activities in conflict zones have been helpful in minimizing ethno-religious conflicts in order to prevent violence in conflict-ridden zones of the globe. Best practices recommendations for implementing effective peacebuilding and counter-radicalization programs that aim to counter-radicalization and prevent violent extremism are based on findings derived from the research literature and the selected case studies.",1708646791,,Dissertations & Theses," Emir, HalimEmirHalimEmir, Halim",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3794077771 , 98725542 , 66569 , 9781339056630 , 1526647 , 1526647", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339056630, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1708646791?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Hizmet+movement%3A+Fostering+universal+values+and+negating+radicalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Emir%2C+Halim&amp;isbn=9781339056630&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"762,Children of glory: Orphan care and the cultural limits of evangelical activism,"This research extends our understanding of the ways culture not only facilitates social movement participation, but also constrains it. In particular, it provides empirical evidence of what I call the ""dilemma of evangelical activism."" In short, I show how the American evangelical subculture both compels evangelicals to engage their society, while simultaneously ensuring that those efforts at social engagement fail. As an empirical case, I focus on the contemporary American evangelical orphan care movement, and draw on theoretical insights from the sociology of culture and morality, religion, organizations, and social movements. I demonstrate how certain aspects of the American evangelical subculture, while precipitating collective flurries of social engagement among evangelicals, ensure that these attempts at social engagement will ultimately be self-limiting. That is to say, while evangelicals are compelled by their activistic orientation to address social issues in tangible ways, I argue that these attempts at social engagement will ultimately fall short of accomplishing long-term social change because of certain constraints inherent within evangelicalism itself. Data for this study are taken primarily from 157 in-depth interviews with movement elites and grassroots participants involved at some capacity in adoption, foster care, and global orphan care. I supplement this interview data with content analyses of movement literature; ethnographic material collected from over two and a half years of participant observation at movement events; and various quantitative data sources including national surveys, government data on adoption and fostering, and a database of orphan care movement organizations. My analyses demonstrate how the evangelical ""cultural schemas"" of idealism and Christian pietism, individualism/anti-structuralism, and relationalism, as well as the populist tendencies of evangelicalism, constrains evangelical attempts at mobilization in three important ways. First, because evangelicals tend to view individual ""heart-transformation"" as the only legitimate means through which social change is accomplished, evangelical leaders are limited in their mobilization repertoires to certain strategies that seek to shape individual beliefs and values (preaching, teaching, one-on-one conversations, writing) as opposed to changing social structures. I demonstrate this by drawing on a content analysis of evangelical orphan care ""mobilization literature"" and interviews with key movement leaders. Second, because evangelicals believe that ""right actions"" must be preceded by ""right motives"" and done in the ""right way,"" they are limited in their mobilization targets. That is, the only morally-appropriate persons to mobilize to social engagement are those who are motivated by the ""right reasons"" (e.g., the gospel, God's glory, obedience to calling) and in the exact way God has prescribed in the Bible. Consequently, evangelicals exclude an enormous number of potential allies and forfeit potential resources that could be mobilized to address their particular social cause. Lastly, I show how the cultural schemas of individualism/anti-structuralism and idealism/Christian pietism intersect with evangelical tendencies toward populism in ways that simultaneously compel grassroots families toward (rash) activism through shallow theological teaching and exhortation, while also limiting evangelical congregations' willingness to accommodate for such families in their day-to-day struggles. I argue that these evangelical subcultural tendencies conspire to ensure that evangelical attempts at social engagement are difficult to sustain, and, in the case of many adoptive of fostering families, ended with tragic consequences for the activists' families and the children themselves. I conclude the study by highlighting the implications of this research and hypothesizing extensions of the argument to other venues of evangelical social engagement including their recent efforts at addressing sex-trafficking, racial reconciliation, and poverty.",1708647446,,Dissertations & Theses," Perry, SamuelPerrySamuelPerry, Samuel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3794086031 , 98726202 , 66569 , 9781321882193 , 3711798 , 3711798", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321882193, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1708647446?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology",," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology"," Religion , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Adoption , Culture , Evangelical , Family , Religion , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Children+of+glory%3A+Orphan+care+and+the+cultural+limits+of+evangelical+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perry%2C+Samuel&amp;isbn=9781321882193&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"763,"Organic farmers, German vintners, and the atomic monster of Seabrook: A trans-Atlantic history of social activism and nuclear power from New England to West Germany","This study focuses on citizen intervention, direct action, and antinuclear activism from West Germany to New England in the twentieth century. Samuel Lovejoy's war against the nuke in Montague, the politicization of German vintners in Breisach, the site occupation in Wyhl, and the rise of the Clamshell Alliance in Seabrook provide the framework for a trans-Atlantic narrative on the development of the antinuclear movement in the Atlantic World during the 1970s. Using both oral histories and archival research on antinuclear protest in New England and the Rhine Valley in West Germany, what this paper ultimately demonstrates is that the model of direct action used by the nuclear opposition at Wyhl provided the inspiration behind the organization of the Clamshell Alliance in the fight against the atomic monster in Seabrook, New Hampshire. Along the way, the story explores how shared concerns over thermal pollution, low-level radiation, and the authoritative nuclear state politicized everyday people. Seemingly ordinary farmers, vintners, and fishermen rallied against nuclear power and joined what were essentially grassroots social movements in order to challenge the authority of the state. This project is significant because it questions traditional American and European historiography on environmental and social movements first by studying the relationship between nuclear technologies, political boundaries, and the traditional social order, and second by situating the antinuclear movement within a trans-Atlantic context. This study places two heretofore separate social and environmental histories into a single transnational narrative, and in the process, a new interpretation of the Cold War is presented based on nuclear power and social activism in the Atlantic World. Ultimately, the smaller story of the antinuclear movement from New England to West Germany is told on order to reframe and expand the larger story that becomes the Cold War.",1708647591,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, David C.SmithC.DavidSmith, David C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3794086711 , 98726282 , 66569 , 9781321883510 , 3711881 , 3711881", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321883510, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1708647591?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history"," 0337 American history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history"," 0337 American history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history",," 0337 American history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history"," American history , World History , Modern history"," Social sciences , Antinuclear movement , Clamshell Alliance , Cold War , Germany , New Hampshire , Nuclear power , Trans-Atlantic , Wyhl",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Organic+farmers%2C+German+vintners%2C+and+the+atomic+monster+of+Seabrook%3A+A+trans-Atlantic+history+of+social+activism+and+nuclear+power+from+New+England+to+West+Germany&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+David+C.&amp;isbn=9781321883510&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"764,Constructing a Counter-Discourse: Agroecological Formação At The MST's Milton Santos School,"The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement ( Movimento Sem Terra , MST) is one of the largest social movements in the world. Situated in a country with extremely unequal land distribution, the MST was originally concerned with obtaining land for agrarian reform settlements through the occupation of latifúndia (large estates of the landed elite). However, after realizing its struggle over land rights was rooted in deeper structural issues in Brazilian society, the MST broadened its goals to seeking wider societal change. Over the past thirty years, it has evolved into a movement that pursues social justice by challenging dominant capitalist discourses. This thesis focuses on one tactic in the pursuit of this goal: the movement’s incorporation of agroecology into its official discourse and the subsequent establishment of agroecological schools to disseminate agroecological knowledge across the movement. It argues that adoption of agroecology as both a set of scientific agricultural practices and a new way of life serves as a key strategy in the MST’s counter-hegemonic project. Drawing on Antonio Gramsci’s theory of hegemony, complemented by Michel Foucault’s understanding of discourse, this thesis traces the incorporation of agroecology as a strategy in the MST’s “war of position” to change the “common sense” in Brazilian and wider global discourses on agrarian reform. Through peasant pedagogy (“ formação ”) – both in the classroom and through daily activities – the MST’s agroecological project seeks to construct new understandings of people’s relationships with nature and each other.",1710514351,,Dissertations & Theses," Turniawan, Marian LiTurniawanLiMarianTurniawan, Marian Li",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3801578481 , 96225752 , 66569 , 9781321903560 , 1593905 , 1593905", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321903560, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1710514351?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0517 Agricultural education , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0366 Geography , 0517 Agricultural education , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0366 Geography , 0517 Agricultural education , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0366 Geography , 0517 Agricultural education , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Geography , Agricultural education , Latin American Studies , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Education , Agrarian reform , Agroecology , Brazil , Gramsci , Landless people movement , Popular education , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+a+Counter-Discourse%3A+Agroecological+Forma%C3%A7%C3%A3o%0AAt+The+MST%27s+Milton+Santos+School&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turniawan%2C+Marian+Li&amp;isbn=9781321903560&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"765,NGO Ties to INGOs and Human Rights Framing in the Global Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Social Movement,"Recently scholars have begun to investigate the factors that explain NGO ties to INGOs in global social movements, and NGO use of human rights framing. With originally collected data on the political and organizational contexts of 93 NGOs in the global sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) social movement, I use logistic regression to examine the effects that NGO political contexts related to state repression and organizational contexts related to NGO resources, goals, strategies, and human rights culture have on the existence of NGO ties to INGOs in the global SOGI movement. I also examine the effects that political contexts related to state repression and organizational contexts related to strategies, ties to INGOs, and human rights culture have on SOGI NGO use of human rights framing. I find that NGO ties to INGOs are not related to state repression of political rights, but that NGOs in states that are more repressive on SOGI legal issues are less likely to have ties to INGOs than NGOs in states with positive protections for SOGI. For NGO use of human rights framing, the results indicate that state repression does not affect SOGI NGO use of human rights framing, whether measured as repression of political rights or repression of SOGI rights. NGO strategies related to education are strongly associated with NGO use of human rights framing.

The following chapters locate the answer to this question in intertwining ideas on religion and realism. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw an upsurge of vernacular literature portraying contemporary life in China alongside deliberations on the meaning of a newly introduced term: “religion” ( zongjiao ). This process launched a long lasting perception of literature as effective—capable of turning a country in flux to a strong nation. The story of modern Chinese literature’s rise to such prominence forms part of a transnational history, linking national literatures and Christian modernity. Across the colonial world, Protestant missionaries introduced the idea that a true-to-life literary portrayal can mobilize readers into action by appealing to their natural sympathy towards human suffering. These theories found a seedbed in China, Japan, India and Africa, where various authors modified the Christian evangelical message into a thorough critique of imperialist thought. Chapter One begins with the global rise of “Life” in the 1910’s as a new epistemology for understanding the human. In China, deliberations over the meaning of life hinged upon interactions with social Darwinism, American Protestant ideas on religious experience, Bergsonian vitalism, critiques of materialism in German Lebensphilosophie, and Chinese Neo-Confucian ethical thought. “Life” became the main axis pivoting debates on how to save China from its plight: Could evolutionary biology account for the truth of life? Could religion explain aspects of life that biology cannot? The task of representing the truth of life was entrusted upon the fledgling modern Chinese fiction and poetry. Chapters Two and Three trace this conviction in the powers of literature to nineteen-century missionary essay contests. Held in sites of imperial encroachment around the world, these contests promoted fiction writing as a miraculous endeavor. Similar to the way that reading the scriptures was supposed to produce a sense of connection to the great beyond, so too was the spiritual message of literary texts believed to ignite a “sympathetic resonance” ( gongming ) between authors and readers that would propel the latter to social action. The religious concept of sympathy inspired Chinese authors to further explore the connections between man and the universe in search of the perfect representation of life. This search led to an important encounter with the Bengali Renaissance Movement, explored in Chapters Four and Five. Rabindranath Tagore’s visit in China (1924) serves as a point of departure to investigate how prominent Chinese authors experimented with concepts such as “Eastern Spirituality” “The Poet’s Religion” and “Folktales”. Such literary interactions added important dimensions to the formation of Chinese realism, by envisioning Pan-Asian literary sympathies, which redefined the meaning of religion, life, and the nation. By foregrounding the transnational collaborations and interactions of religion, realism, and Asian solidarity in shaping Chinese literature, this dissertation offers a multi-sited perspective on the unmatched significance of modern literature to China’s national revival and, in turn, delivers a new understanding of China’s role in a global deliberation over the meaning of human life.",1710812473,,Dissertations & Theses," Gvili, GalGviliGalGvili, Gal",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3803314391 , 94960662 , 66569 , 9781321941838 , 3715865 , 3715865", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321941838, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1710812473?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0422 Philosophy"," Comparative literature , Asian literature , Religion , Philosophy"," Language, literature and linguistics , Philosophy, religion and theology , China , Literature , Modern , Realism , Religion , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+Search+of+the+National+Soul%3A+Writing+Life+in+Chinese+Literature%0A1918%E2%80%931937&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gvili%2C+Gal&amp;isbn=9781321941838&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"767,"The transnational religious leader, regime change, and state sovereignty: The unlikely case comparison of Pope John Paul II and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam","The role of religion in shaping geopolitics and its associated norms is often overlooked by international relations scholars. This influence can be examined through the lives of transnational religious leaders (TRLs), particularly those who contribute to new definitions of state sovereignty through their involvement in regime change. Two seemingly incomparable figures center in this paper's case studies- Pope John Paul II and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam. Pope John Paul, through the roles of pastor to a transnational community and head of an international organization, lent international legitimacy to the Solidarity movement, which contributed to the fall of Communism in Poland. Abdullah Yusuf Azzam authored the theological concept of ""defensive jihad"", led the transnational Afghan Arabs in armed resistance against Soviet invasion in Afghanistan during the Soviet Afghan war, and contributed to the creation of a global jihadist movement. Traditionally, Westphalian sovereignty claims that the territorial state holds ultimate authority over the affairs within its borders and that it is the primary actor in the international system. This dissertation examines how the characteristics of a TRL and the characteristics of the associated transnational social movement (TSM) qualify regime change as an indicator of challenges to conceptions of Westphalian sovereignty and modern state sovereignty. Characteristics of TRL include leadership style, hard versus soft power, relationship to secularization, and relationship to modernity. Characteristics of TSM include political theology, mobilizing structures, political opportunity structures, and nature of transnational activism. In both case studies, a transnational leader used soft power, based in a transnational religious identity and civil society, to contribute to a transnational social movement that helped alter the domestic authority structures in Poland and Afghanistan. As individual actors determining the actions of nation states, these TRLs ultimately challenged state sovereignty.

Rather than being simply an overlooked element of the national folk revival movement, the Cajun-Creole music revival was a larger phenomenon with a broader social and political context, promoted by local, state, national and international actors. The French government conceived of the music revival as one aspect of a global French language movement. National folklorists used the music to prompt conversations on race relations and social justice. Local actors sought to reassert the value of traditional culture in an economically and demographically diversifying region. Ultimately, under the stresses of the ethnic revival movement, Cajun-Creole music, which had been developed by black and white musicians over centuries of collaboration, cohabitation, and sympathetic engagement, split into two genres as Creoles began to identify with urban African-American culture and Cajuns became caught up in the rhetoric of ethnic identity. Chapter 1 chronicles the role Cajun-Creole music played in Southwest Louisiana culture in the early twentieth century. Chapter 2 argues that the French-speaking Louisianans who served in World War II played an instrumental role in reviving old-time music. Chapter 3 examines the work of the nationally and state-funded folklorists and commercial label scouts who, while doing fieldwork in Southwest Louisiana, found their long-held conceptions about folk music, race, and culture challenged in a more integrated and ""foreign"" part of the American South. Chapter 4 illuminates the role of the avant-garde artist Harry Smith in creating the folk revival of the 1960s and introducing a national to Cajun-Creole music. Chapter 5 looks at the Newport Folk Festival and the ethnomusicology fieldwork that put Cajun-Creole musicians on a national stage. Chapter 6 chronicles the history of the French language movement in Louisiana, arguing that the language revival of the 1960s was largely initiated and funded by international entities. Chapter 7 argues that the civil rights and ethnic identity movements ultimately split Cajun and Creole music into distinct genres.",1712400237,,Dissertations & Theses," Peknik, Patricia JeanPeknikJeanPatriciaPeknik, Patricia Jean",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3807447551 , 99025752 , 66569 , 9781321988109 , 3718800 , 3718800", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321988109, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1712400237?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0413 Music"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0413 Music"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0413 Music",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0413 Music"," American studies , American history , Music"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Cajun music , Louisiana folklore",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exotic+folk%3A+Old-time+French+Louisiana+music+and+the+politics+of+culture%2C+1946%E2%80%931973&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peknik%2C+Patricia+Jean&amp;isbn=9781321988109&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"769,"The unknown lands: Nature, knowledge, and society in the Pantanal of Brazil and Bolivia","This dissertation examines the modern history of the Pantanal, a seasonally-flooded wetland in the upper Paraguay River watershed at the border between Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Scientists and environmentalists currently regard the Pantanal as a wildlife-rich and “pristine” ecosystem threatened by uncontrolled development. I seek to understand the historical roots of these perceptions through an analysis of the transnational set of social actors—naturalists, boundary officials, indigenous peoples, field scientists, merchants, ranchers, cowboys, and hunters—who made discursive and material claims upon the Pantanal from 1870 to 1967. During this period, the Pantanal experienced rapid integration into global flows of commerce and a network of ranchers, merchants, and government officials formed to profit from a growing trade in cattle products and other commodities, including ipecacuanha , quebracho , and wild animal products. To justify their efforts to control space and the movement of people and goods through the Pantanal, these groups perpetuated a myth of isolation with origins in the colonial period. While the myth of isolation persisted, this study also reveals how perceptions of the Pantanal changed over time and varied according to social position. While powerful stakeholders (officials, engineers, merchants) viewed the Pantanal ecology as a problem to be overcome, rural populations used cycles of flood and drought to their advantage, adopting mobile lives and subsistence strategies that drew upon the resources of the Pantanal and neighboring biomes. During the first half of the twentieth century, a critical shift occurred when field scientists identified the Pantanal as an ideal location for zoological specimen collection and Brazilian and international sportsmen rediscovered the region as a “paradise” for hunters. While development-minded stakeholders continued to search for ways to shape the Pantanal into the mold of progress, by the 1960s a growing number of social groups questioned this imperative and articulated a need to protect the region and its wildlife. In the process, they silenced the voices of local populations who continued to subsist upon the region and its resources. These competing perceptions of the Pantanal planted the seeds for a conflict over conservation and development that defines the region to this day.",1717848041,,Dissertations & Theses," Kauffman, Jason B.KauffmanB.JasonKauffman, Jason B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3822576121 , 99320962 , 66569 , 9781339003917 , 3719775 , 3719775", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339003917, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1717848041?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0336 Latin American history , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0336 Latin American history , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0336 Latin American history , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Latin American history , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Bolivia , Borderlands , Brazil , Commercial hunting , Field sciences , Frontier development , Pantanal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+unknown+lands%3A+Nature%2C+knowledge%2C+and+society+in+the+Pantanal+of+Brazil+and+Bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kauffman%2C+Jason+B.&amp;isbn=9781339003917&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"770,"Toward a fourth cinema?: 8-millimeter film and cultural politics in Mexico City, 1968-1974","In the early 1970s, young middle-class men in their early twenties from Mexico City experienced a sense of political ambivalence and identity dysphoria connected to the global transformations of the 1960s and their local manifestations. For a small group of them, eight-millimeter filmmaking became a tool of self-representation and fashioning and a means to demonstrate one’s capacity for expression. This was Mexico’s first experiment in democratic filmmaking and it had lofty goals to take cultural production out of the hands of the state and the industry. However, what started as an amateur cinema came to overlap with radical politics, the international counterculture, the co-optive policies of the state, and the broader film culture, evolving into a short-lived, yet vibrant and explosive eight-millimeter film movement that became increasingly polarizing. This dissertation examines the history of eight-millimeter cinema as both a social movement and as a tool linking cultural politics to the changing experience of everyday life and shifting subjectivities. This historical and ethnographic approach to the study of this type of filmmaking situates it more in the historical context of the “global 1960s,”—a moment that was about the battles associated with globalization and the cultural revolution felt at the local level, including perceptions of the self, family dynamics, urban living, gender and class identities, sexuality, and the mass media. Eight-millimeter was used to navigate, perform, and assuage these contradictions as it was a factor in exacerbating them. The dissertation is based on research in personal archives and on original oral histories. It focuses on the formative years of filmmaker Sergio García as a method to examine how the changes of the 1960s and 70s were felt a the level of the everyday and then transferred into the world of cinema. It then moves outward to examine eight-millimeter as a social movement, in which García played a major role. The dissertation also consists of a feature length-documentary film project directed and edited by the author called ""The Beginning of My End.""",1718150219,,Dissertations & Theses," Boles, JenniferBolesJenniferBoles, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3823691191 , 99341802 , 66569 , 9781321957952 , 3716672 , 3716672", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321957952, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718150219?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Latin American Studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , 1968 , Film studies , Global 1960s , La onda , Mexican counterculture , Super-8 millimeter cinema",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toward+a+fourth+cinema%3F%3A+8-millimeter+film+and+cultural+politics+in+Mexico+City%2C+1968-1974&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boles%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9781321957952&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"771,"Becoming Roma: Gypsy identity, civic engagement, and urban renewal in Turkey","This dissertation is a study of economic, political, and social reforms in contemporary Turkey and how they are experienced by the country’s Romani (“Gypsy”) population. By focusing on urban renewal projects, the pluralization of cultural identities, and the proliferation of civil society organizations, this dissertation analyzes these changes in urban Romani communities, examining how state and civil society initiatives impact identity and civic engagement. This research contributes broadly to work in anthropology studying the relationship between culture and power, specifically investigating how local cultural identities and practices intersect and interact with transnational political-economic processes. While the meaning and application of the concept of ‘culture’ has been much debated in the social sciences, this analysis is situated within studies that consider culture a site of governance. Many modern forms of governance work less through force than by subjecting culture to the political logic of empowerment and improvement. This study interrogates this process via ethnographic research with dislocated Roma and Romani rights civic actors in three Turkish cities, focusing in particular on one dislocated Romani community from a neighborhood in Istanbul known as Sulukule. The project is unique in that it addresses Romani identity, culture, and citizenship where they intersect with current politics around urban development in Turkey. While ‘urban renewal’ projects are incorporating the land of the urban poor into new plans for Istanbul as a global city, Romani residents find themselves increasingly dispossessed. More than interventions that aim to improve the conditions of Turkey’s Roma, urban development has renewed the politicization of urban Romani communities, particularly the youth, who have begun participating in social movements and Romani rights activism. The study finds that, while the changes resulting from liberalization and democratization in Turkey are typically posed by scholars, politicians, and civil society actors as either positive or negative, the advantages and disadvantages for marginalized populations like the Roma are actually simultaneously produced and mutually constituted. While Turkey’s Roma are being integrated into discourses, practices, and institutions of Turkish national belonging and transnational Romani rights solidarity, they are also facing the dissolution of their local communities, traditional occupations, and cultural life. This dissertation suggests broader repercussions for anthropological understandings of the impact of free-market liberalization and democratization in so-called ‘developing countries,’ and particularly interrogates the politics of ‘openness’, the relationship between civil society and ‘political society’, and the role of transnational networks in urban politics.",1719260549,,Dissertations & Theses," Schoon, Danielle V.SchoonV.DanielleSchoon, Danielle V.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3827888361 , 96178712 , 66569 , 9781339020846 , 3720937 , 3720937", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339020846, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1719260549?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0440 European Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Cultural anthropology , European Studies , Middle Eastern Studies"," Social sciences , Civil society , Identity , Reform , Roma , Turkey , Urban",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Becoming+Roma%3A+Gypsy+identity%2C+civic+engagement%2C+and+urban+renewal+in+Turkey&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schoon%2C+Danielle+V.&amp;isbn=9781339020846&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"772,Between Mao and Gandhi: Strategies of violence and nonviolence in revolutionary movements,"From Eastern Europe to South Africa to the Arab Spring, nonviolent action has proven capable of overthrowing autocratic regimes and bringing about revolutionary political change. In fact, recent research suggests that nonviolent movements are more than twice as effective in achieving their goals than violent ones. So why do some political movements nevertheless believe it necessary to take up arms? Can they be convinced otherwise? This dissertation examines why political movements that seek to overthrow the state come to embrace a strategy of either armed insurgency or civil resistance. I argue that characteristics of a movement's base of popular support—its size, organization, and networked structure—influence the movement's perceptions of the relative effectiveness of violent versus nonviolent tactics and consequently shape its strategic behavior. To test the theory, I employ a mixed-method research design. Statistical analysis of a cross-national dataset of revolutionary movements allows me to test competing theories and locate new empirical puzzles. Based on these quantitative findings, I select four cases of revolutionary campaigns from Nepal for a more fine-grained qualitative study. Drawing on six months of fieldwork in Nepal and India, including archival research as well as over 60 interviews with ex-combatants, movement leaders, and local experts, I use cross-case comparisons and within-case process-tracing tests to further elucidate the theoretical mechanisms, check for measurement error, and search for alternative explanations not previously considered. The study promises several important contributions both to the study of conflict dynamics as well as to the broader fields of international relations and comparative politics. The project highlights the role of nonviolent resistance as both an important geopolitical phenomenon in need of greater understanding in its own right, and as an alternative to armed conflict that influences when, where, and why we see violence occur. It thus challenges prevailing theories of civil war that presume armed force as the only means to achieve maximalist political goals. Furthermore, by analyzing the social institutions that underpin revolutionary movements, the study presents evidence that intergroup dynamics and organizational structures merit serious attention as key determinants of rebel strategy, contributing to an emerging literature on the institutional and organizational foundations of conflict processes. Finally, the findings have real-world implications for policymakers and global activists who have an interest in better predicting where conflicts are more likely to turn violent or in encouraging groups to embrace nonviolent methods.",1720325290,,Dissertations & Theses," Thurber, ChesThurberChesThurber, Ches",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3830670731 , 95553012 , 66569 , 9781339042367 , 3722248 , 3722248", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339042367, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1720325290?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," Social sciences , Conflicts , Nepal , Nonviolence , Political movements , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+Mao+and+Gandhi%3A+Strategies+of+violence+and+nonviolence+in+revolutionary+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thurber%2C+Ches&amp;isbn=9781339042367&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"773,"The common cause of all advanced and progressive mankind: Proletarian internationalism, Spain, and the American Communist Press, 1936 – 1937","In July 1936, units of the Spanish military, backed by a collection of domestic right-wing elements and by fascist governments elsewhere in Europe, staged a rebellion against the legally constituted national government that had been elected five months previously. The governing bloc, an ideologically broad coalition of liberal republicans, Marxists, and anarchists known as the People’s Front, embodied the strategy formulated by Stalin and the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow to stem the advance of international fascism and mitigate the danger it posed to the Soviet Union and, by extension, the communist movement and the global radical working class it represented. During the destructive and bloody civil war that ensued, the Comintern sponsored recruitment of anti-fascist volunteer fighters from around the world. Before the war ended, nearly 3,000 Americans had surreptitiously traveled to Spain to defend its republican government. This thesis addresses the question of how these volunteers came to develop an allegiance to their global political and social movement strong enough to motivate them to risk death in what they perceived to be its defense against fascism. Drawing on the theoretical formulations of political scientists Benedict Anderson and David Malet, this thesis will demonstrate that over the course of a century, radical proletarian internationalism developed into a community of working-class revolutionaries, mostly within or allied to communist parties, whose shared ideological formulations and sociopolitical aspirations bound them together, irrespective of nationality. American members of that global community – whose numbers and influence had recently expanded in the context of the Great Depression and the People’s Front strategy of liberal-left conciliation – had their perceptions and priorities about the Spanish crisis shaped by the American communist press. Examination and analysis of its coverage of the political, social, and military dimensions of the conflict there will demonstrate it to have been copious and persistent, imparting unmistakably to its readership the centrality of the Spanish people’s struggle against fascism in the defense of the global working class, whose political and social survival was at stake. The thesis will argue, in the context of the contentious historiography of American communism, that although the messages conveyed to American proletarian internationalists via the communist press reflected policies and priorities determined in Moscow and designed to serve the interests of the Soviet state, American anti-fascists were for the most part well informed ideologues whose decisions reflected both the concerted influences of their movement’s leadership as well as their own deep commitments to a more equitable world.",1721998200,,Dissertations & Theses," Waterman, G.

In general, however, those who have benefited most from climate-changing fossil-fueled development are also most insulated from its deleterious effects, while those who have contributed and benefited least suffer such effects first and most dramatically. Regulatory response frameworks are challenged by, and may exacerbate, these challenges to justice. This dissertation draws on interviews, participant observation and documentary sources in a relational analysis of social responses to climate change framed by law, governance and political mobilization. The methodological approach examines the socio-ecological, socio-spatial and governmental connections these initiatives acknowledge, construct, elide or erode. Part 1 demonstrates how institutionalized practices and epistemologies of dis connection have compromised the efficacy and justice of response efforts structured by international human rights law, multilateral treaty negotiations, and economistic modes of governance. Part 2 explores the construction of and tensions within what I call a politics of connection, as pursued by a subset of civil society actors engaged in advocacy and activism for climate justice. These politics consist in challenging separation and highlighting or constructing connection in each relational domain. The analysis suggests that response efforts are not likely to halt the progression of climate change or resolve its multi-dimensional justice issues without recognizing and accounting politically for the various facets of its embedding in socio-ecological processes and relations at scales and sites from the global to the local. The politics of connection, then, presents possibilities for transformation toward more effective and just responses to the climate crisis. The study contributes to theoretical development and political debate by addressing (1) the spatiality of transnational social movements, (2) the political relevance of the more-than-human, and (3) the role of “civil society” in constituting governance and contesting socio-ecological power. Linking (1) and (2), I argue that more-than-human assemblages constitute conditions for constructing transnational solidarities and, more importantly, for grounding a politics of socio-ecological justice that can socialize, historicize and politicize global change in the Anthropocene. I propose the term socio-ecological conjunctures to index the objects of activist analyses that articulate globally-extensive socio-ecological processes with the community- and place-based concerns of established and incipient political identities. Analyses of socio-ecological conjunctures can more broadly politicize climate change, both superseding the militant particularisms of place-based politics and grounding tenuous transnational alliances. Addressing (3), I argue that the urgency of imminent disparate impact incites multiplicity, pragmatism, and ongoing experimentation in the pursuit of protection from and redress for climate harms, which operate in tandem with the purer politics of radical political ecological critique. Civil society emerges therefore, in these ecological politics, as an indeterminate figure encompassing these and other engagements; its presence in both official and “outside” political spaces marking both as contested terrain.",1722049764,,Dissertations & Theses," Derman, BrandonDermanBrandonDerman, Brandon",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3835956581 , 99021332 , 66569 , 9781339071541 , 3723979 , 3723979", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339071541, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1722049764?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Geography , Climate Change , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Earth sciences , Climate justice , Law and society , Political ecology , Socio-ecological conjunctures , Socionature , The political",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+Climate+Justice%3A+Social+Natures+and+Political+Spaces+of+the+Anthropocene&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Derman%2C+Brandon&amp;isbn=9781339071541&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"775,The Danger of Recuperation and the Lure of Antipolitics: The Political Philosophy of Left Communism,"Marxist political theory has been characterized since its inception in Marx's early works by a tension between two different approaches to politics. On the one hand, the early Marx—echoing themes of Hegelian philosophy—championed the revolutionary transcendence of the capitalist status quo in a moment of apocalyptic revolutionary confrontation between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. On the other, Marx recognized the necessity to build a practical workers' movement within capitalist society to advance the communist program. In the Communist Manifesto, he formulated a series of practical political and socio-economic demands that might be implemented through the democratic state. These two conceptions of politics have defined a tension in Marxist political theory between a ""left communist"" and a ""state-centric"" vision ever since. In the nineteenth century, the state-centric side predominated in the form of social democracy. However, with the failure of the Second International to oppose World War One, the left communist side arose again in the context of the Russian and German Revolutions. A new Communist movement emerged that championed the cause of world revolution against social democratic reformism. However, as the German Revolution failed and the Russian Revolution was isolated, the international communist movement, on Lenin's recommendations, returned to the path of state-centric Marxism, as it sought to remain politically relevant in the post-World War One era by building a practical party movement with a base in the trade unions and in national parliaments. This trend was opposed by a new self-conscious left communist movement that resisted the return to state-centric policies by emphasizing the revolutionary power of working-class self-creativity as expressed by the emergence of new grassroots organs such as the workers' councils. This dissertation charts the evolution of left communist political theory, specifically in the forms developed by the Dutch and German communist left, through its confrontation with state-centric Marxism. It elucidates the main points of left communist theory, examining its strengths, as well as its problems and contradictions, as it evolved over the course of the twentieth century towards so-called ""council communism"". The dissertation concludes with an Epilogue that attempts to ascertain the relevance of left/council communist political theory for emancipatory social movements today.",1723378433,,Dissertations & Theses," Gretz, MichaelGretzMichaelGretz, Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3840670331 , 92776452 , 66569 , 9781339107462 , 3726154 , 3726154", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339107462, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1723378433?accountid=14496," 0578 History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science"," 0578 History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science"," 0578 History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science",," 0578 History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science"," History , Modern history , Political science"," Social sciences , Council communism , European history , Intellectual history , Left communism , Marxism , Political philosophy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Danger+of+Recuperation+and+the+Lure+of+Antipolitics%3A+The+Political+Philosophy+of+Left+Communism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gretz%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=9781339107462&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"776,"Constructing global womanhood: Women's international non-governmental organizations, women's ministries, and women's empowerment","Recent history has seen a large degree of worldwide activity surrounding the category of women and women’s incorporation into social institutions, such as education and government. International organizing around the category of women continues to flourish in the form of women’s international non-governmental organizations (WINGOs). Alongside this increasing international civil society activity, the period since 1960 has seen increasing foci on gender equality and empowerment as ideological goals informing mechanisms of national development around the world. In this dissertation, I bring together findings from research in social movements, political sociology, international relations, and cultural sociology in arguing a neo-institutional approach to the following questions: how has the structure and discourse of women’s global civil society evolved over time, what is the effect of women’s global civil society on the structural expansion of governments to include women globally, and what influence do women’s global civil society and structural expansion in government have on women’s institutional power outcomes cross-nationally? Based on world society theory, I argue that world society is a locus of messages regarding women which are diffused to nation-states through linkages to international organizations. Furthermore, both women’s empowerment and national institutional incorporation are cultural constructions from world culture that diffuse to nation-states through international organizations and have increasingly come to define legitimacy of nation-states, leading to expansion in social concerns of the state to include women. Chapter 1 traces WINGO structure and discourse across time as demonstrated in analyses on increases in WINGO foundation over the period since 1888, increases in national WINGO memberships since 1965, and an exploratory factor analysis of sixteen non-mutually exclusive WINGO categories (UIA 1960-2014). Chapter 2 analyzes expansion in state structure towards women, supporting a world society argument through empirical tests employing event history regression methods to explain rate of women’s ministry establishment as a function of linkage to WINGOs and United Nations-designated Least Developed Country status. Finally, Chapter 3 analyzes the effects of world society and national government structural expansion to include women on women’s institutional power outcomes cross-nationally since 1960, considering women’s labor force participation, women’s tertiary education enrollment, and women’s parliamentary representation.",1725140472,,Dissertations & Theses," Russell, Rachael JoyceRussellJoyceRachaelRussell, Rachael Joyce",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3844010161 , 96876332 , 66569 , 9781339124131 , 3727346 , 3727346", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339124131, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1725140472?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Civil society , Non-governmental organizations , Transnational , Women's empowerment , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+global+womanhood%3A+Women%27s+international+non-governmental+organizations%2C+women%27s+ministries%2C+and+women%27s+empowerment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Russell%2C+Rachael+Joyce&amp;isbn=9781339124131&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"777,"New Haitian social movements: Alternative modernities, (trans)local nationalisms, and solidarity economies","My dissertation is the first project on the Haitian Platform for Advocacy for an Alternative Development- PAPDA, a nation-building coalition founded by activists from varying sectors to coordinate one comprehensive nationalist movement against what they are calling an Occupation. My work not only provides information on this under-theorized popular movement but also situates it within the broader literature on the postcolonial nation-state as well as Latin American and Caribbean social movements. The dissertation analyzes the contentious relationship between local and global discourses and practices of citizenship. Furthermore, the research draws on transnational feminist theory to underline the scattered hegemonies that intersect to produce varied spaces and practices of sovereignty within the Haitian postcolonial nation-state. The dissertation highlights how race and class, gender and sexuality, education and language, and religion have been imagined and co-constituted by Haitian social movements in constructing ‘new’ collective identities that collapse the private and the public, the rural and the urban, the traditional and the modern. My project complements the scholarship on social movements and the postcolonial nation-state and pushes it forward by emphasizing its spatial dimensions. Moreover, the dissertation de-centers the state to underline the movement of capital, goods, resources, and populations that shape the postcolonial experience. I re-define the postcolonial nation-state as a network of local, regional, international, and transnational arrangements between different political agents, including social movement actors.

Not only was it demonstrated that the established material and ideational preferences of existing states have strong bearing on a movement’s ideological orientation and by consequence its chosen course of struggle, but hegemonic order configurations also define political cleavages and in so doing present movement leaders with both tactical and strategic opportunities by harnessing or exploiting those cleavages.

""Global Korea"" seeks to transcend the geographic boundaries of the Republic of Korea while simultaneously re-inscribing the limits of ethnonational identity by confusing the temporal distinctions of tradition and ethnic belonging to the geopolitical construct of ""Korea."" Globalization was introduced in Korea as a nationalist project that continued on the developmental trajectory that had been pursued by the preceding authoritarian regimes, but the movements of South Korean citizens, diaspora Koreans, and non-ethnic-Korean immigrants in and out of the country has created a transnational community of shared social and cultural practices that now constitute the global image of Korean culture. National culture had been a major site of conflict between authoritarian regimes, opposition groups, and the specter of North Korea over the representation of a unified culture and ethnic heritage. However, civil society and economic successes in the 1990s brought about a crisis of identification, while migration flows began to threaten the exclusive correspondence between citizenship and ethnic identity. Studies of contemporary Korea have recognized the nationalist appropriation of globalization, but I argue that the parallel development of national culture and information technology in South Korea has resulted in a deracinated signifier of ""Koreanness"" that can be performed through the consumption and practice of mediated ""Korean"" content. Through a study of cultural policies; international literary events; and literature, film, and popular culture texts, I trace the vicissitudes of intervention and opposition by state, institutional, and individual actors involved in the production and transmission of Korean culture. I begin with the imbrication of national culture and information technology in Chapter 1, from the establishment of the Ministry of Culture and Information in the 1960s, to the application of the country's well-developed research and technology sectors to the newly defined ""cultural industries"" in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In Chapter 2, I analyze the proceedings of international literary events held in Seoul from 2003-2011 that protested the instrumentalization of culture while decrying the persistence of a hierarchy of cultural distinction in ""World Literature."" These chapters draw out the productive tension between the state's conception of culture as content or commodity to be regulated, and the international artistic establishment's view of culture as a ""field of struggle."" In the following chapters I chart the intermedial discourse of identity and belonging to communities of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, national origin, and class through cultural texts from the early 2000s. In Chapters 3, 4, and 5, I analyze newly canonized literature and films about migrant laborers to South Korea (Ch. 3); popular TV dramas about Korean cuisine and the culinary industry (Ch. 4), and ""historical"" narratives that challenge generic boundaries through time travel, hybrid sonic registers, and alternate histories (Ch. 5). South Korea becomes the signifier of an ideal ""Korean"" space in these texts. It is at once a de-territorialized multi-ethnic space of excessive consumption; an idealistically cosmopolitan, yet ethnically homogeneous space of economic and class mobility; and a socially progressive atemporal space of pre- and post-modern aesthetes. ""From Tradition to Brand"" builds on critical discourses of multiculturalism, globalization, visual media, genre, narrative, and transnational cultural studies to conclude that South Korean global culture performs a temporal double-bind that erases its present-tense cultural identity in favor of a recuperative past in the utopian future.",1728319407,,Dissertations & Theses," Medina, Jenny WangMedinaWangJennyMedina, Jenny Wang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3851942461 , 99907232 , 66569 , 9781339187549 , 3732091 , 3732091", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339187549, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1728319407?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies",," 0305 Asian literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," Asian literature , Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Cultural policy , Film and television , Globalization , Multiculturalism , South Korea , Translation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Tradition+to+Brand%3A+The+Making+of+%27Global%27+Korean+Culture+in+Millennial+South+Korea&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Medina%2C+Jenny+Wang&amp;isbn=9781339187549&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"780,Chicana/o Indigenous Affirmation as Transformational Consciousness: Indigeneity and Transnational Human Rights Advocacy since the Chicana/o Movement,"Indigenous social movements in the Americas have multiple sources, but in regards to Mexican Americans, my focus considers Chicana/o Indigeneity of particular importance to decolonization efforts because of its density, scope, and breadth, as well as spatial location. My dissertation answers the following question: how are Chicana/o assertions of cultural Indigeneity, intrinsically parallel and related to Chicana/o participation in Indigenous transnational struggles? The underlying premises for my investigation of Chicana/o Indigeneity are the following subquestions: how do transnational these efforts enrich our understanding of the respect of human rights, and what are the bases of Chicana/o Indigeneity? I explicate how Chicana/o historic consciousness is influenced by the complex transnational activism with Indigenous Peoples to decolonize the Americas and contend that Chicana/o Indigenist activists, informed by trans-border interactions, cultural practices, and long oral traditions challenged hegemonic constraints of Indigeneity constructed by Mexican and U.S. pro-western domination premised assimilationist projects. These challenges have resulted in Chicana/o participation in broader challenges to the prominence of western cultural hegemony in the nation-states of the Americas. I depict groups and organizations comprising a specific activism that challenge assimilation and contribute to the prominence of contemporary Indigenismo or Indigenism as a cultural and political ideology. This activism, which seeds and stimulates Indigenism, instills calls for cultural assertion within international human rights advocacy. I focus on Chicana/o activists, activist organizations, and cultural groups that demanded the right to revive their Indigenous culture, and in doing so, aligned their cultural revival with the right to cultural survival that is integral to the demands of Indigenous Peoples. Since the late 1960s, the objective of Chicana/o statements on Indigeneity have provided the forum for a discussion regarding a culturally autonomous trajectory for Chicanas and Chicanos free of colonial logics, hegemonic cultures, and oppression. By no means has this road been straight forward and without equivocations. Nevertheless, by the 1980s and well into the twenty-first century, most Chicana/o and Indigenous activists stood generally unified by certain precepts and agreements despite national borders in their efforts to redress the violation of human rights in the Americas.",1728328401,,Dissertations & Theses," Serrano Najera, Jose LuisSerrano NajeraLuisJoseSerrano Najera, Jose Luis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3852003221 , 94836392 , 66569 , 9781339048512 , 3722638 , 3722638", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339048512, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1728328401?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0740 Native American studies"," American history , Hispanic American studies , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Chicana/o history , Human rights , Indigeneity , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Chicana%2Fo+Indigenous+Affirmation+as+Transformational+Consciousness%3A+Indigeneity+and+Transnational+Human+Rights+Advocacy+since+the+Chicana%2Fo+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Serrano+Najera%2C+Jose+Luis&amp;isbn=9781339048512&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"781,"Appropriate technology in the African oil palm belt: Diffusion, culture, and environment","The Appropriate Technology movement began in the 1970s as an alternative approach to international development. The movement inspired a generation of development planners and engineers to create a more just and sustainable world through technologies that contributed to radical deindustrialization, reduced energy consumption, and the conservation of natural resources. But did the movement achieve any of its goals before it lost popularity as a development model after only a decade? Were appropriate technologies successful, in what ways, and according to whom? What were the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the technologies, and were they sustainable? This dissertation responds to these questions through a case study of a small-scale palm oil expeller that was invented as an appropriate technology and promoted by development projects in Cameroon, Benin, and Liberia over a period of thirty years. The study brings together analytical insights from development studies, cultural and political ecology, and critical technology studies and is guided by a conceptual model that integrates the humanistic study of material culture with applied project evaluation. By following the trajectory of the technology as a physical manifestation of an ideology, the study provides empirical evidence of the localized impacts of one manifestation of the global appropriate technology movement. The sustainability of the technology is evaluated with regard to social, economic, and environmental dynamics contributing to its persistence over space and time. The palm oil expeller was successful in achieving compatibility with the existing work styles, preferred work practices, and social values of the users. Its economic performance is the main factor driving continued diffusion, but the technology may lead to greater social inequalities and diffused environmental pollution that could decrease its sustainability over the long term.

The movement quickly infiltrated online spaces, and splashed throughout social media where celebrities like First Lady Michelle Obama and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres held up signs with the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. Using semantic network analysis in following the “#BringBackOurGirls” hashtag after the one-year anniversary of the abduction, and in-depth interviews with activists and influencers in Nigeria and North America, this thesis explores how technology, expressly Twitter, can influence the progression of a new social movement like #BringBackOurGirls. It finds Twitter serves as a powerful public space for minorities and marginalized voices to circumvent traditional media; once there, these actors can express opinion and opposition in a succinct format, as well as unite and organize swiftly in their capacity as new social movements.

Many historians have described his dramatic race for mayor of New York on a Labor Party ticket in 1886. Few, however, have written about the relationship between George, who died in 1897, and his campaign manager, Tom Johnson, who as Mayor of Cleveland became the nation’s leading proponent of public ownership of utilities during the early 20 th century. Similarly absent from the literature is an appreciation of how Louis Post’s single-tax newspaper, The Public, modernized George’s policies for leading progressive reformers like Brand Whitlock, Newton Baker, William U’Ren, and Frederic C. Howe. Rather than fading after George’s death, the movement had by the 1910s developed a firm basis of power in American cities, where it expanded the Democratic Party’s reach and accrued the political capital to obtain high positions in the Wilson Administration. Its leading members worked to establish important reforms like the Australian ballot, direct legislation, and the income tax. I show that George’s ideas found their home in a cosmopolitan, urban, and transnational middle class. The historiography does not account for the importance of the single tax in British liberalism or the implementation of land value taxation in Australia, New Zealand, and Denmark. The single tax, I argue, was a response to exorbitant premiums charged for space in urban areas. George’s disciples hoped to redistribute the wealth levied in high urban rents. By attaching itself to this sort of universal factor of exchange, the movement garnered both global and cross-class appeal. Furthermore, I show that Georgism was part of the transnational ideology of liberalism. Because classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo had composed the canon of liberal thought with a view toward undermining the moral legitimacy of the landed aristocracy, George had ample precedent to argue that the success of modern capitalism was contingent upon the nationalization of land. George offered a powerful way to incorporate elements of socialism into classical liberalism.",1729568799,,Dissertations & Theses," England, Christopher WilliamEnglandWilliamChristopherEngland, Christopher William",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3856588011 , 95448712 , 66569 , 9781339206219 , 3732633 , 3732633", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339206219, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1729568799?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0536 Land Use Planning"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0536 Land Use Planning"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0536 Land Use Planning",," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0536 Land Use Planning"," American history , Economic history , Land Use Planning"," Social sciences , Henry george , Intellectual history , Land reform , Progressivism , Single tax , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Land+and+Liberty%3A+Henry+George%2C+the+Single+Tax+Movement%2C+and%0Athe+Origins+of+20th+Century+Liberalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=England%2C+Christopher+William&amp;isbn=9781339206219&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"784,Transnational Social Movement Activism in the New Urban World,"The world currently stands at a crossroads. Globalization has raised living standards all over the world, but globalization is also defined by rising inequality and extreme polarization (Sassen 2013). This disparity between rich and poor is most prominent in cities, now the primary lived experience for the majority of people. Grassroots social movement organizations (SMOs) represent an important avenue for advancing social justice in the globalized urban world, but there are significant gaps in the current understanding of this process. Most importantly, there is reason to believe that cities act as movement spaces (Nicholls 2009) that offer a better environment for SMOs as compared to less urban areas. However, it is not clear precisely how cities encourage social movement activism at both the organizational and individual level, how or if this process differs across national borders, or how much activism depends on contextual effects as opposed to individual factors. This dissertation advances previous research by studying urban social movement activism in a cross-national, multilevel framework. First, I examine whether the global economic competitiveness of a city encourages SMO persistence. Using a sample of 672 SMOs in 67 global cities drawn from the Transnational Social Movement Organization Dataset 1953-2003 (Smith and Wiest 2012), I test the organizational, urban and national determinants of two organizational outcomes: viability and age. Results indicate that global urban competitiveness, professionalization, alliances with intergovernmental organization actors and urban resources best predict SMO persistence in global cities. Next, I explore how urban status, relative deprivation and resource levels influence the likelihood of individual participation in six different forms of social and political activism in Europe's recent protest wave. Using the 5th wave of the European Social Survey, a series of multilevel logistic regressions indicate that European cities encourage citizen activism by connecting SMOs to the kinds of people most likely to participate. Finally, I further examine Europe's protest wave and study how successful grassroots actors were at achieving media standing as compared to institutionalized, bureaucratic actors during Europe's anti-austerity movement. A content analysis of 4,486 quotes published in the New York Times from January 2010-March 2013 indicates that institutionalized elites were better able to achieve media standing, but the overall sentiment was decidedly anti-austerity. Nevertheless, austerity became European policy, which indicates that the international media as measured here did not have a strong effect. The findings of this dissertation indicate that cities act as movement spaces by promoting a better match between the supply of and demand for human and material resources, creating international and local networks of activism and connecting organizations to important allies like nongovernmental organizations and media actors. Results also indicate that resources play a strong role in SMO formation and persistence. Taken together, these findings point to a type of social movement convergence, in which organizational form and activity looks somewhat homogenous across national borders. I conclude with a discussion of the implications for future transnational social movements.",1730390022,,Dissertations & Theses," Schoene, MatthewSchoeneMatthewSchoene, Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3857683781 , 98003012 , 66569 , 9781339162799 , 3730138 , 3730138", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339162799, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1730390022?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," International Relations , Political science , Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Globalization , Social movements , Urban social movements , Urban sociology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+Social+Movement+Activism+in+the+New+Urban+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schoene%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781339162799&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"785,The Literacy Learning Experiences of Egyptian Students at the American University in Cairo: At the Intersection of Transnational Dimensionality and Intranational Flow in Literacy Studies,"This study examines the experiences of five Egyptian undergraduate students at the American University in Cairo (AUC) from different educational, class and geographic backgrounds. This study finds that students from public schooling and lower socioeconomic backgrounds arrive at AUC with significant language, literacy and social deficits compared to counterparts from private schooling and high socioeconomic backgrounds. The study considers how participants, based on the backgrounds, become involved with transnational literacy practices in university writing assignments. The study draws upon scholarship in transnational literacy studies, to inflect how New Literacy Studies considers global and local literacies with concepts of capital and positionality drawn from Pierre Bourdieu. The study conceptualizes student educational and class backgrounds as forms of cultural and social capital which, when deployed at AUC, result in differing participant positionality along educational and class lines. Although this distribution creates challenges for students from public schooling backgrounds, the study also finds that a student from a public schooling background exhibited unusually adaptive qualities, resulting in novel approaches to completing a complex literacy task. The study concludes by arguing that transnational literacy studies be extended to account for intranational movements within uniquely configured embedded, hybrid and permeable transnational spaces that serve local interests.",1731045079,,Dissertations & Theses," Austin, James PaulAustinPaulJamesAustin, James Paul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858664631 , 95925392 , 66569 , 9781339218120 , 3733518 , 3733518", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339218120, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731045079?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education,, 0515 Education, Education," Education , American university in cairo , Composition studies , Egypt , Literacy studies , Transnational literacy studies , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Literacy+Learning+Experiences+of+Egyptian+Students+at+the+American+University+in+Cairo%3A+At+the+Intersection+of+Transnational+Dimensionality+and+Intranational+Flow+in+Literacy+Studies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Austin%2C+James+Paul&amp;isbn=9781339218120&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"786,West Bank Public Transportation: Movement as Politics,"West Bank Public Transportation: Movement as Politics is a study of mobility via public transportation as an important object of social struggle and the social mobilization that can result from creative engagements with transit. In Palestine, public transportation has and continues to be used as a way for Israeli occupation forces to impose social control on Palestinians. At the same time, Palestinians use transit in both intentionally political and quotidian ways to build connections and community despite the occupation's efforts to fragment Palestinian society. Against a shattered topography of walls, tunnels, gates, and checkpoints, transit becomes the stage on which battles for territorial sovereignty, social cohesion, dignity, and human rights play out. While scholars have written about the structural impediments to Palestinian movement and the social fractures that result, they have not focused specifically on transit as a strategic instrument for state imposition of separation and grassroots efforts to connect. I contribute such a focus on public transportation as both my direct object of study–I examine its characteristics, structures, and usages as a system–and as a lens through which to better understand the changing economic, political, and racial nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Focusing on key episodes in the history of Palestine in which public transportation has played a significant role, I draw on critical theory, political sociology and social movements scholarship with international legal studies, cultural geography, and critical race theory. Based on ten months of mixed-methods fieldwork in Palestine, I present an analysis of the political dimensions of public transportation control and usage in the late Ottoman period (1892-1918), the British Mandate (1920-1948), the first Palestinian intifada (1987-1993), the Oslo years (1993-2000), the second Palestinian intifada (2000-2008), and the present-day West Bank. This socio-historical approach to the study highlights the value of transit for the imposition but also the bridging of geographic fragmentation in Palestine. An examination of mobility through the specific lens of transit reveals a uniquely nuanced picture of the strengths of state power as well as the limits imposed on it by popular mobility. My findings indicate that transit has been a useful tool in furthering various colonial and national aspirations over the last 120 years, enabling some and undermining others based on who exerts or subverts control over transit and how they do so. I relate my findings to international law to illustrate the importance of the universal human right to freedom of movement for the functioning of everyday life, how that right is routinely violated, and the ways in which people register explicit and implicit demands for that right to be restored. Finally, I argue that any productive resolution to the colonial affliction of Palestinian life must prioritize the unfettered mobility of Palestinians across Palestine.",1731126875,,Dissertations & Theses," Griffin, Maryam SusanGriffinSusanMaryamGriffin, Maryam Susan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858701231 , 99808362 , 66569 , 9781339218212 , 3733526 , 3733526", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339218212, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731126875?accountid=14496," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0626 Sociology"," Middle Eastern Studies , Peace Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Freedom of movement , Mobility , Palestine , Public transportation , Statehood , West bank",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=West+Bank+Public+Transportation%3A+Movement+as+Politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Griffin%2C+Maryam+Susan&amp;isbn=9781339218212&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"787,Policing the Wretched: Transnational Apparatuses of Social Control in the Early 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called “war on drugs” in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call “transnational apparatuses of social control”. It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed “wars” on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance. The three different sites (Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador) exemplify the linkages of transnational methods of social control and opposition during the epoch of global capitalism.",1731126945,,Dissertations & Theses," Osuna, StevenOsunaStevenOsuna, Steven",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858701221 , 99808362 , 66569 , 9781339218205 , 3733525 , 3733525", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339218205, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731126945?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Sociology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Global capitalism , Hip hop , Moral panic , Racism , Social control , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Policing+the+Wretched%3A+Transnational+Apparatuses+of+Social%0AControl+in+the+Early+21st+Century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Osuna%2C+Steven&amp;isbn=9781339218205&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"788,Interdependence as a Lifeway: Decolonization and Resistance in Transnational Native American and Tibetan Communities,"Struggles for decolonization are not only national but also transnational and global. While decolonization projects are diverse, they generally call for both the undoing of colonization as a structure and the amelioration of its psychological and ideological effects. Native American communities have been waging resistance to settler societies in various ways for over 500 years. In the last 50 years, Tibetans in exile have mobilized a global project to resist Chinese occupation through the ‘Tibet movement’. Native American religious traditions are rooted in a sacred relationship to the land, one’s community and the spirit world. The spirit world consists of the dynamic ‘life force’ immanent in all natural phenomena. Native American peoples cite an interdependent relationship to all natural phenomena as the fundamental logic driving the protection of sacred sites, sustainable ways of living and nationhood. Tibetan Buddhism combines land-based conceptualizations of relatedness to Buddhist philosophical concepts of ‘dependent origination’ –meaning that all phenomena are inextricably ‘dependent’ on one another—to theorize a unique form of interdependence. Buddhist ethics rooted in interdependence encourage empathy and compassion for all others, since they are ultimately an extension of one’s self. This dissertation analyzes the role of religion in the decolonization movements of transnational Native Americans and Tibetan communities living in the U.S. A core focus of many decolonization movements is resisting culture erasure through religious revitalization—the logic being religion constitutes the core values and traditions of a given community. When cultural identity is strengthened these communities are better able to resist colonial advances as well as practices of extermination. I ask, how does interdependence as a ‘lived’ tradition resist colonization as both a structure and ideology? In addition, how are these religious traditions informing global movements for decolonization? I argue that cultural regeneration—centrally in the form of religion practice—is a driving factor in resistance, if not sometimes the very practice of resistance. This research demonstrates that religious praxis not only resists cultural erasure and assuages colonization’s psychic/psychological effects but also regenerates Tibetan and Native peoplehood, contributing to their projects of sovereignty. Religious praxis heals and strengthens these communities but is also understood to create the material conditions for liberation—in essence, spiritual phenomena re-configures the material world—for example, through the ritual purification of karma or the purification of one’s body in the sweat lodge. The dynamic intersection of religion and politics in these movements provides a new perspective on social justice and humanitarianism, illustrating that the just and humane treatment of others is necessitated in world in which others are an extension of one’s self.",1731134245,,Dissertations & Theses," Cisneros, Natalie AvalosCisnerosAvalosNatalieCisneros, Natalie Avalos",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858707641 , 95927442 , 66569 , 9781339218373 , 3733538 , 3733538", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339218373, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731134245?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0318 Religion , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0318 Religion , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0318 Religion , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," Religion , Asian American Studies , Native American studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Decolonization , Healing , Indigeneity , Native , Sovereignty , Tibetan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interdependence+as+a+Lifeway%3A+Decolonization+and+Resistance+in+Transnational+Native+American+and+Tibetan+Communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cisneros%2C+Natalie+Avalos&amp;isbn=9781339218373&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"789,Building bridges: Church women united and social reform work across the mid-twentieth century,"Church Women United incorporated in December 1941 as an interdenominational and interracial movement of liberal Protestant women committed to social reform. The one hundred organizers represented ten million Protestant women across the United States. They organized with the express purposes of helping to bring peace on Earth and to develop total equality within all humanity. Church Women United was the bridge between the First and Second Wave of Feminism and the bridge between the Social Gospel and Social Justice Movements. Additionally they connected laterally with numerous social and religious groups across American society. As such, they exemplify the continuity and matrix of reform in American history. Because they worked to promote international peace, develop positive race relations, and advance women’s rights, their campaigns give us a model for how to rectify the social problems of today. These women used communal prayer, politics, education, and hands-on labor to promote their ideas. They originated in collective prayer and continued this tool, but they added letter writing campaigns, public education forums, and lobbying politicians at all levels including the president to advance their goals. They held massive campaigns to collect needed items for war-torn countries and natural disaster areas as well as acting as counselors to the needy. They raised public awareness of issues facing migrant laborers, inner-city residents, Native Americans, Japanese internment detainees, and then worked hard to ameliorate the worst of these problems. They promoted literacy around the world, as well as new agricultural techniques to address human conditions that were known to lead to political and social unrest. This dissertation covers the mid-twentieth century while being predominately focused on the years 1941-1968. This study is built upon multiple archives across the United States and oral histories of movement leaders. It is one of the first interdenominational studies focused on the work of women in social reform work. This dissertation enlarges our knowledge of feminism and social reform work.",1731911821,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, Melinda MarieJohnsonMarieMelindaJohnson, Melinda Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3860786971 , 100088922 , 66569 , 9781339176604 , 3731274 , 3731274", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339176604, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731911821?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History",," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History"," Religious history , Womens studies , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Church women united , Feminism , Peace , Race relations , Social gospel , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+bridges%3A+Church+women+united+and+social+reform+work+across+the+mid-twentieth+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Melinda+Marie&amp;isbn=9781339176604&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"790,"Negotiating the place of Assyrians in modern Iraq, 1960–1988","This dissertation deals with the social, intellectual, cultural, and political history of the Assyrians under changing regimes from the 1960s to the 1980s. It examines the place of Assyrians in relation to a state that was increasing in strength and influence, and locates their interactions within socio-political movements that were generally associated with the Iraqi opposition. It analyzes the ways in which Assyrians contextualized themselves in their society and negotiated for social, cultural, and political rights both from the state and from the movements with which they were affiliated. Assyrians began migrating to urban Iraqi centers in the second half of the twentieth century, and in the process became more integrated into their societies. But their native towns and villages in northern Iraq continued to occupy an important place in their communal identity, while interactions between rural and urban Assyrians were ongoing. Although substantially integrated in Iraqi society, Assyrians continued to retain aspects of the transnational character of their community. Transnational interactions between Iraqi Assyrians and Assyrians in neighboring countries and the diaspora are therefore another important phenomenon examined in this dissertation. Finally, the role of Assyrian women in these movements, and their portrayal by intellectuals, will be evaluated using a gendered perspective.",1732684199,,Dissertations & Theses," Benjamen, AldaBenjamenAldaBenjamen, Alda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3864330561 , 99854062 , 66569 , 9781339097459 , 3725445 , 3725445", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339097459, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1732684199?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Middle Eastern history , Middle Eastern Studies"," Social sciences , Assyrians , Intellectual history , Iraq , Minorities , Transnationalism , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Negotiating+the+place+of+Assyrians+in+modern+Iraq%2C+1960%E2%80%931988&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Benjamen%2C+Alda&amp;isbn=9781339097459&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"791,Contesting Technologies in the Networked Society: A Case Study of Hydraulic Fracturing and Shale Development,"In this dissertation, I study the network structure and content of a transnational movement against hydraulic fracturing and shale development, Global Frackdown. I apply a relational perspective to the study of role of digital technologies in transnational political organizing. I examine the structure of the social movement through analysis of hyperlinking patterns and qualitative analysis of the content of the ties in one strand of the movement. I explicate three actor types: coordinator, broker, and hyper-local. This research intervenes in the paradigm that considers international actors as the key nodes to understanding transnational advocacy networks. I argue this focus on the international scale obscures the role of globally minded local groups in mediating global issues back to the hyper-local scale. While international NGOs play a coordinating role, local groups with a global worldview can connect transnational movements to the hyper-local scale by networking with groups that are too small to appear in a transnational network. I also examine the movement's messaging on the social media platform Twitter. Findings show that Global Frackdown tweeters engage in framing practices of: movement convergence and solidarity, declarative and targeted engagement, prefabricated messaging, and multilingual tweeting. The episodic, loosely-coordinated and often personalized, transnational framing practices of Global Frackdown tweeters support core organizers' goal of promoting the globalness of activism to ban fracking. Global Frackdown activists use Twitter as a tool to advance the movement and to bolster its moral authority, as well as to forge linkages between localized groups on a transnational scale. Lastly, I study the relative prominence of negative messaging about shale development in relation to pro-shale messaging on Twitter across five hashtags (#fracking, #globalfrackdown, #natgas, #shale, and #shalegas). I analyze the top actors tweeting using the #fracking hashtag and receiving @mentions with the hashtag. Results show statistically significant differences in the sentiment about shale development across the five hashtags. Results also indicate that the discourse on the main contested hashtag #fracking is dominated by activists, both individual activists and organizations.",1734038030,,Dissertations & Theses," Hopke, Jill E.HopkeE.JillHopke, Jill E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3869645961 , 96180842 , 66569 , 9781339234250 , 3734748 , 3734748", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339234250, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734038030?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0791 Energy"," 0459 Communication , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0791 Energy"," 0459 Communication , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0791 Energy",," 0459 Communication , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0791 Energy"," Communication , Environmental Studies , Web Studies , Mass communications , Energy"," Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Fracking , Global frackdown , Hydraulic fracturing , Social media , Social movements , Twitter",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+Technologies+in+the+Networked+Society%3A+A+Case+Study+of+Hydraulic+Fracturing+and+Shale+Development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hopke%2C+Jill+E.&amp;isbn=9781339234250&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"792,"Framing neoliberalism: The counter-hegemonic framing of the global justice, antiwar, and immigrant rights movements","This dissertation explores how three social movements deployed an anti-neoliberal master frame during the course of a multi-movement protest wave. Using ethnographic content analysis. I examine the Global Justice (GJM), Antiwar (AWM), and Immigrant Rights movements (IRM) of the 2000s to offer a theoretical synthesis of the framing perspective in social movements and Gramscian hegemony, which I call the counter-hegemonic framing approach. This approach links the contested discursive practices of social movements to historically specific political-economic contexts to offer a macro framework to make sense of this meso-level activity that illuminates the development of a counter-hegemonic master frame. I apply this approach in case studies of each movement and a culminating incorporated comparison. In the GJM chapter, I found that the GJM frames neoliberal institutions such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund as influenced by corporate power. Second, the GJM amplifies the symptoms of neoliberal globalization such as global inequality and environmental degradation. Third, there is a master frame specific to neoliberalism which defines neoliberal globalization as a corporate project that seeks to reduce environmental, human rights, and labor regulations by eroding sovereignty in order to open markets and increase profits. For the AWM, I found that the movement integrated the context of both rollback and rollout neoliberalism into their framing to build opposition to the Afghan and Iraq War. In addition, following the corporate power frame of the GJM, the AWM problematizes the involvement of corporations in foreign policy discussions. For the IRM, I found that one of the central goals of their framing was to deflect blame away from undocumented immigrants. There are two ways the IRM accomplished this. First, the IRM emphasized the economic contributions of immigrants. Second, the IRM emphasized the impact of neoliberal globalization as a cause of increased immigration and social problems for which migrants were blamed. Finally, in an incorporated comparison of these case studies I found a distinct anti-neoliberal “repertoire of interpretation,” which forms the basis of an anti-neoliberal master frame that emphasizes US hegemony, corporate power, economic inequality, and neoliberal rollout.",1734457409,,Dissertations & Theses," Hardnack, ChristopherHardnackChristopherHardnack, Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3870966721 , 98987112 , 66569 , 9781339171098 , 3730786 , 3730786", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339171098, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734457409?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Globalization , Hegemony , Immigrant rights , Neoliberalism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framing+neoliberalism%3A+The+counter-hegemonic+framing+of+the+global+justice%2C+antiwar%2C+and+immigrant+rights+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hardnack%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781339171098&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"793,"In search of a global, godly order: The ecumenical movement and the origins of the League of Nations, 1908-1918","This dissertation traces the origins of the League of Nations movement during the First World War to a coalescent international network of ecumenical figures and Protestant politicians. Its primary focus rests on the World Alliance for International Friendship Through the Churches, an organization that drew Protestant social activists and ecumenical leaders from Europe and North America. The World Alliance officially began on August 1, 1914 in southern Germany to the sounds of the first shots of the war. Within the next three months, World Alliance members began League of Nations societies in Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Great Britain and the United States. The World Alliance then enlisted other Christian institutions in its campaign, such as the International Missionary Council, the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., the Blue Cross and the Student Volunteer Movement. Key figures include John Mott, Charles Macfarland, Adolf Deissmann, W. H. Dickinson, James Allen Baker, Nathan Söderblom, Andrew Carnegie, Wilfred Monod, Prince Max von Baden and Lord Robert Cecil. This dissertation is the first to examine the multinational, religious origins of the League of Nations. It shifts the focus off of the League’s most famous advocate, Woodrow Wilson, and places the designs of the League within a broader Protestant movement that recruited politicians and transformed churches into avenues for pro- League propaganda. The first three chapters outline the movement’s international scope and worldview, whereas the final four chapters focus on the movement in the national contexts of the United States, Britain, neutral Europe and Germany. The World Alliance possessed two intertwined aims: firstly, a union of Christian churches that could complete the Christianization of the globe in their generation; and, secondarily, the establishment of a international federation of states, bound together by a free covenant before God, that would prevent Christendom from ever again descending into civil war. In the minds of the earliest advocates of the League of Nations, these two objectives were intertwined to the extent that many ecumenical organizations began to redefine themselves according to this new political orthodoxy, while the League movement became saturated in moral and pseudo-religious terms.",1734464934,,Dissertations & Theses," Donahue, James M.DonahueM.JamesDonahue, James M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3871046681 , 100297342 , 66569 , 9781339181646 , 3731721 , 3731721", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339181646, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734464934?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history"," 0320 Religious history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history"," 0320 Religious history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history",," 0320 Religious history , 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history"," Religious history , World History , Modern history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Ecumenical movement , League of Nations , Peace movement , Protestantism , Wilson, Woodrow , World War I",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+search+of+a+global%2C+godly+order%3A+The+ecumenical+movement+and+the+origins+of+the+League+of+Nations%2C+1908-1918&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Donahue%2C+James+M.&amp;isbn=9781339181646&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"794,"Women's work for women: Chinese Christian women and Western missionaries in Canton, South China, 1847–1938","The slogan, ""Woman's work for woman,"" represented the zeal of the American women's missionary movement from the mid-nineteenth to the First World War (1914-18). Influenced by evangelical Protestant religious revivals, American women committed to serve non-White women and children in their home country as well as in non-European areas of the world, including China. This dissertation challenges the dominant missionary notion underlying ""woman's work for woman,"" which presumes a binary understanding of women as either givers or takers and reinforces the essentialization of ""woman"" as a category. In actuality, both women missionaries and local women contributed to local women's work in the expansion of global Christianity at the turn of the century. Through a regional study of Christian women's work at the Canton Mission of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (later on merged into the Church of Christ in China) from 1847 to 1938, this dissertation demonstrates the dynamic intercultural cooperation and negotiations of ""women's work for women"" between and among Chinese Christian women and women missionaries. Significantly, it affirms that women missionaries and newly empowered Chinese Christian women formed a negotiable space for ""women's work for women,"" providing educational, social, and medical services, as well as evangelizing work for Chinese women in Canton, South China. This study demonstrates the multiple agencies in these two categories of women, in response to changing contexts in the US and in China. Adding to other biographical and institutional studies, this dissertation examines the network of the local Christian women's community, which expanded through denominational and interdenominational ties, social (between alma mater and alumna), and individual (both natal and marital families, and intergenerational connections), as well as national and transnational relationships.",1734684653,,Dissertations & Theses," Wong, Wai-Yin ChristinaWongChristinaWai-YinWong, Wai-Yin Christina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3871682971 , 100310052 , 66569 , 9781339233970 , 3664449 , 3664449", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339233970, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734684653?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies"," African Studies , Religious history , Womens studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Canton (Guangzhou) China , Chinese Christianity , Presbyterian Church in the USA Local Christian Women's Community , Women and Missions , Women's Work for Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women%27s+work+for+women%3A+Chinese+Christian+women+and+Western+missionaries+in+Canton%2C+South+China%2C+1847%E2%80%931938&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wong%2C+Wai-Yin+Christina&amp;isbn=9781339233970&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"795,The Social Life of Logistics on the Moroccan Mediterranean Coast,"If Morocco is the historic crossroads between Africa and Europe, then Tangier is the informal capital of crossing. To be urban denizens of this city includes the everyday experience of seeing Spain and Gibraltar on the horizon, and of navigating between the winds that blow from the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. This dissertation follows the Tangier Med Port, a new infrastructure opened in 2007 at this intersection between lands and seas in order to transform Morocco into a major actor in the global logistics of trade. Merely nine miles from Europe, this port was built at one of the busiest bottlenecks in world shipping to serve as a platform for global commodity circulation. To be Moroccan actors in the industries of this emerging global hub includes the shared experience of seeing this bottleneck translated into the materials of work. While mega-ports are planned as infrastructures of commodity circulation, port actors translate plans into the everyday logistics of circulating commodities. In the five chapters of this dissertation, I analyze both the aspirations of this global logistics hub as well as the everyday logistics of commodity circulation in the port region. In chapter one, I examine the global, national, and regional context of the Tangier Med Port through an analysis sensitive to the past, present and future. I show how the perspectives of Tangier inhabitants and port administrators reveal contrasting versions of global regionalism. In chapter two, I follow the regional social worlds of trailers and containers in order to illustrate how these objects of physical movement connect the Tangier Med Port to a larger region of socio-technical practice. In chapter three, I examine how the aspirational discourses at the port authority exclude concerns deemed too “Moroccan” in order to qualify the Tangier Med Port as a uniquely modern infrastructure. These discourses position the port as the ideal platform for transcending the perceived temporal incongruity between Morocco and the Global North. In chapter four, I propose the concept of “practical connectivity” to replace traditional metaphors of friction or flow for understanding how emerging port connections are mediated in particular projects of global logistics. In the final chapter, I contrast the shifting visibilities of labor and infrastructure during and after a major work stoppage at the port’s container terminals in 2011. Stoppages reveal how these terminals, designed primarily for moving transshipped goods between vessels, are reframed by dockworkers into innovative platforms of global solidarity. My ethnographic study of the Tangier Med Port and its actors reveals multiple, planned and unplanned ways through which commodity movement is assembled in a particular context. I intend this dissertation to advance the ethnography of logistics as a discrete field of inquiry into the maritime infrastructures changing the shores of the Global South, creating new supply-chain subjectivities, and altering how commodities move in the world.",1734894335,,Dissertations & Theses," Rothenberg, JanellRothenbergJanellRothenberg, Janell",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3872130441 , 94442222 , 66569 , 9781339206899 , 3732664 , 3732664", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339206899, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734894335?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0560 North African Studies , 0709 Transportation planning"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0560 North African Studies , 0709 Transportation planning"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0560 North African Studies , 0709 Transportation planning",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0560 North African Studies , 0709 Transportation planning"," Cultural anthropology , North African Studies , Transportation planning"," Social sciences , Circulation , Globalization , Infrastructure , North Africa , Transportation , Work",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Social+Life+of+Logistics+on+the+Moroccan+Mediterranean+Coast&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rothenberg%2C+Janell&amp;isbn=9781339206899&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"796,The Production and Consumption of Slow Food as an Aesthetic Response to Risk: Exploring the Embodied Realities of Subjecthood and Health Activism,"Through this study, I examined Integration Acres as a living example of Slow Food’s aesthetic response to global risk. Moreover, I explored Integration Acres as an illustration of a form of alternative organizing that attempted to (re)organize society and create a vibrant way of being in the modern world. It is important to remember that social movements are realized through specific individuals and specific bodies within specific contexts. The human body is inscribed by and vulnerable to ideological and discursive shifts (e.g., public dialogue about eating habits). I situate the disciplined and embodied consumption of food as a salient concern to organizational and health communication scholars. In order to understand contemporary social movements such as Slow Food, it is important to map how they move from an aesthetic orientation to instrumental goals. I propose an iterative phenomenological arch that moves from the sumptuous orientation to the present out into a shared world of contestation, communion and meaning. It maps roughly as follows: A single distilled moment is experienced emotively through the body (i.e., aesthetic presence) and then moves through into a world of proto-symbols (i.e., imagination). Once a moment is experienced in the imagination it takes on the outlines of language and discourse. To become meaningful for social change, movements such as Slow Food transform imagination into story. Stories are inherently relational and are sharable objects brought into a social world of communion and contestability. I assert that Slow Food is a contemporary social movements that can be best understood through pragmatic aesthetic principles. The current neoliberal discourse is based on a highly technical, individual, entrepreneurial and instrumental logic. If actionable, an aesthetic orientation to identity and social organizing serves as a powerful socio-political tool in the battle over what the landscape of our shared social world will look like in the present and future. A host of contemporary social movements, such as Slow Food and the local food movements, have risen up as, not only an alternative form of identity, but as an alternative form of knowledge beyond strictly instrumental rationalities that unites both intrinsic and instrumental goals. Slow Food is a direct response to the neo-liberal economy, globalization and the fast life, and its concept of slow living is an aesthetically grounded and imagined sense of community that is rooted in specific artistically created objects—food. This view of food, aesthetics, community, health, and the body are divergent to the current public health discourses that assigns responsibility to the individual while systematically ignoring the socio-economic and environmental aspects of health (Lupton, 2013).",1735448953,,Dissertations & Theses," Broderick, Michael L.BroderickL.MichaelBroderick, Michael L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3874232791 , 100365032 , 66569 , 9781339177601 , 3731377 , 3731377", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339177601, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1735448953?accountid=14496," 0359 Food Science , 0459 Communication , 0570 Nutrition"," 0359 Food Science , 0459 Communication , 0570 Nutrition"," 0359 Food Science , 0459 Communication , 0570 Nutrition",," 0359 Food Science , 0459 Communication , 0570 Nutrition"," Food Science , Communication , Nutrition"," Communication and the arts , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Aesthetics , Food , Health activism , Home , Loss , Narrative , Slow Food",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Production+and+Consumption+of+Slow+Food+as+an+Aesthetic+Response+to+Risk%3A+Exploring+the+Embodied+Realities+of+Subjecthood+and+Health+Activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Broderick%2C+Michael+L.&amp;isbn=9781339177601&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"797,The Practice of Food Sovereignty and &lt;i&gt;Buen Vivir&lt;/i&gt; in Ecuador's Sierra Region,"Ecuadorian member organizations of the transnational social movement La Vía Campesina won legal recognition of the state’s responsibility to guarantee one of their central demands, food sovereignty, or the people’s right to determine their agri-food systems and the extent to which this right can be exercised, in that country’s 2008 constitution and 2009 food sovereignty law. These victories came after decades of uprisings by rural and indigenous social movements resulted in the election in 2006 of Ecuador’s populist president, Rafael Correa, who denounced neoliberalism and made the alternative development paradigm of buen vivir (or “living well,” from the Kichwa sumak kawsay) a central part of his Citizen’s Revolution. Academic literature in the wake of these developments has focused on the ideas of plurinationality and ecologically sustainable development embodied in the concept of buen vivir (Davalos 2009, Escobar 2010, Cobey 2012, Oviedo 2014), analysis of state-social movement interaction in institutionalizing the food sovereignty policy regime (Peña 2013), and participation in this process by urban consumer movements (Van Ongeval 2012). Nevertheless, research into the praxis of food sovereignty and buen vivir by rural communities themselves remains limited. In order to address the dearth in academic literature on these topics and investigate the gap between food sovereignty in principle and in practice, this project takes an action research approach to investigate practices of food sovereignty in three communities of the Sierra region of Ecuador. Specifically, the questions of 1) how practices of food sovereignty mesh with or contradict state policy and social movement rhetoric, 2) how such practices inform the notion of buen vivir as an alternative development strategy, and 3) the extent to which an action researcher can contribute to the food sovereignty of the communities being studied are addressed. These are addressed via the researcher’s participant observation at the invitation of each community as a participant on a multicultural exchange program sponsored by the Quito-based NGO Huayra Causay, for whom the researcher interned for a period of six months. The study finds positive outcomes such as mobilization for grassroots land reform, collaboration with multinational NGOs for targeted investment in irrigation infrastructure and the creation of community governance for its oversight, and partnership with municipal governments to promote rural producer’s associations with direct marketing opportunities such as farmer’s markets. However, significant obstacles still remain, such as contradictory policy, high rate of return conditionality for state investment, and intransigence of the national assembly in the participatory legislative process for food sovereignty, making the notion of buen vivir a still-distant ideal for the communities studied.",1735802532,,Dissertations & Theses," Frederick, Clayton DavidFrederickDavidClaytonFrederick, Clayton David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3875330451 , 100389052 , 66569 , 9781339219257 , 1603389 , 1603389", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339219257, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1735802532?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0344 Social research , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Social research , Agricultural economics , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Action research , Buen vivir , Ecuador , Food sovereignty , Political economy , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Practice+of+Food+Sovereignty+and+Buen+Vivir%0Ain+Ecuador%27s+Sierra+Region&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Frederick%2C+Clayton+David&amp;isbn=9781339219257&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"798,The Bombay Radicals and the left in colonial India,"This dissertation explains how colonial Bombay’s industrial workers played an important role in shaping the city’s cosmopolitan culture, which in turn engendered a new kind of popular mobilization that enabled the final push towards Indian independence. By locating the city’s working-class politics within the larger context of migration and social reform in western India, this dissertation provides an alternate history of the origin of progressive politics and the left in colonial India, which it recognizes has been dominated by doctrinaire Communist Party historians. Scholarship which has attempted to overcome party and nationalist doctrine has focused almost exclusively on the nature of colonial workers’ subjectivity; in so doing it naturalizes the insurmountability of caste and religion. This dissertation documents the overlaps between the anti-colonial movement and the international working-class movement to assert that any historical elaboration on the nature of subjectivity in colonial India must account for the role of enfranchisement that was gained through working-class politics. Drawing upon Marathi, English, Hindi and Gujarati language sources, this dissertation argues that Bombay’s workers compelled nationalist leaders like Gandhi to acknowledge their political agency, irreversibly changing the direction of the independence movement. This working-class movement thrived under the leadership of the Bombay Radicals who were influenced by Marxism and socialism. As their efforts gained results, the Bombay Radicals found themselves threatened by the colonial state, and the dissertation shows how the working-class was systematically co-opted for the project of Indian independence. Finally, this dissertation argues that the quest for a new post-independence paradigm for leftism led the Bombay Radicals to nativism, and Marathi-language progressive literature became the basis for imagining a parochial socialist state for Marathi-speaking workers. This history of Bombay forces a re-examination of the debates over the origins of progressive politics in India. It challenges the scholarship that insists on any exceptionalist claim that the history of India is beholden to the insurmountable categories of a stratified society.",1746692718,,Dissertations & Theses," Pandit, NinadPanditNinadPandit, Ninad",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3888533931 , 100652882 , 66569 , 9781339267302 , 3737409 , 3737409", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339267302, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1746692718?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Asian literature , History , South Asian Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Bombay , Communism , India , Marathi literature , Socialism , Urban history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Bombay+Radicals+and+the+left+in+colonial+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pandit%2C+Ninad&amp;isbn=9781339267302&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"799,Sacral socio-ecological community: Theories of contemporary social Catholicism and engaged Buddhism in complementary practice,"This dissertation provides a substantive study of the faith-based Mondragón Cooperative Movement in Spain and the Indra’s Net Life Community in Korea, analyzing and critically comparing the ethical values of Catholic Social Teaching and Socially Engaged Asian Buddhism. By evaluating the extent of their success in dealing with socioecological concerns, the importance of religio-ethical values and principles to the disciplines of social and environmental ethics is stressed, offering a new, religiously sensitive approach to ecological wellbeing. As this dissertation argues, the thought and work of Mondragón and Indra’s Net offer important resources for conceptualizing ecological ethics and social justice in and among human communities. This comparison considers two questions: First, what alternative economic system might engage, in context, socioecological religious values and be implemented as an alternative to neoclassical economics? Second, what socioecological ethical principles provide effective intellectual resources to critically assess today’s global economic and ecological crises, and suggest a way to resolve them? These questions are addressed by a study of the ethical and social implications of modern economic systems, as compared to a worker-owned cooperative movement and a socially engaged Asian Buddhist liberation movement, both of which offer an alternative to current economic configurations. Inspired by the communitarian personalist thought of Mondragón’s priest-founder, José María Arizmendiarrieta, and the ecological thought of the Venerable Toboˇp, based on Huayan Buddhism’s philosophy of “interdependent co-arising” (pratītyasamupāda), these grassroots socio-ecological movements provide relevant, religion-based social and ecological teachings that present concrete proposals for economic and social practice. Social Catholicism and socially engaged Buddhism, as evidenced by these two movements, apply a dynamic social-spiritual ideology consonant with their traditions’ developing social-ecological consciousness, thereby striving to promote the wellbeing of Earth, humanity, and all life.",1747101897,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Hyung KyuLeeKyuHyungLee, Hyung Kyu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3889611011 , 94554922 , 66569 , 9781339250229 , 3736171 , 3736171", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339250229, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1747101897?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion,, 0318 Religion, Religion," Philosophy, religion and theology , Community , Ecological democracy , Ecological justice , Economic democracy , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sacral+socio-ecological+community%3A+Theories+of+contemporary+social+Catholicism+and+engaged+Buddhism+in+complementary+practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Hyung+Kyu&amp;isbn=9781339250229&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"800,"""Sisters of Men"": Syrian and Lebanese Women's Transnational Campaigns for Arab Independence and Women's Rights, 1910-1949","This transnational history of Syrian women’s activism argues that Syrian women’s identities were shaped by activism at home and abroad at the League of Nations. In the early twentieth century, women in Ottoman Syria—later divided by the French into Syria and Lebanon—forged regional as well as diasporic and activist connections to lobby for rights as Arabs and as women. Drawing from research in over twenty archives in Lebanon, Egypt, Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States, this project provides new historical evidence about how a pan-Arab women’s identity developed and how it was used in relation to domestic and international audiences. In the 1910s, Syrian women focused on providing basic social services to women and the poor. In the 1920s, when the League of Nations imposed the French Mandate for Syria and the British Mandates for Palestine and Iraq, a regional women’s network desirous of Arab independence was born. Women’s rights, which initially meant the right to citizenship, became an international issue during the League of Nations era, 1920-1945. Syrian women seized upon this transformation and channeled the regional Arab women’s network toward the League in the name of Arab independence and women’s rights in the 1930s. Arab women’s activism directed toward the League of Nations decentered the West as the only model for women’s rights. A gendered history of Syrian women’s pan-Arab activism problematizes the existing narrative that the UN Decade for Women, 1975-1985, was the moment when women’s rights first galvanized transnational activism in the global south. The existing history of the international women’s movement erases alternative definitions of women’s rights that circulated in the early twentieth century. In demonstrating the early global engagement of Syrian women on behalf of women’s rights and Arab independence, this history changes the narrative of the origins of transnational women’s activism and internationalizes the study of Arab women’s history. The project uses the lives and activism of Alice Kandaleft Cosma, Julia Tu’mi Dimashqiyya, ‘Afifa Karam, Anbara Salam Khalidi, Nour Hamada, and Ibtihaj Qaddura to challenge the pervasive stereotypes about Arab women’s passivity, which still have currency today.",1749005765,,Dissertations & Theses," Robinson, Nova E.RobinsonE.NovaRobinson, Nova E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3895392091 , 100802362 , 66569 , 9781339228303 , 3734258 , 3734258", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339228303, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1749005765?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science"," Middle Eastern history , Womens studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Arab nationalism , International governance , League of Nations , Lebanon , Syria , Women's rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Sisters+of+Men%22%3A+Syrian+and+Lebanese+Women%27s+Transnational+Campaigns+for+Arab+Independence+and+Women%27s+Rights%2C+1910-1949&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robinson%2C+Nova+E.&amp;isbn=9781339228303&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"801,Reimagining Development: Understanding the Alter-Globalization Movement from Ecovillages to Gross National Happiness,"Ever since the “Battle of Seattle” halted the World Trade Organization meeting in November of 1999, social movement scholars have debated whether the transnational activists who protested in Seattle and in subsequent international summits constitute a unified global movement with a shared identity, values and goals, or if they are an ad hoc, heterogeneous collection of people from separate movements. This study suggests that it may be useful to distinguish between a “negative” –or reactive –and a “positive” –or proactive –convergence. Studies that focus on the negative convergence see participants as protestors who are simply resisting market- driven forces. In contrast, in a positive convergence approach, participants are seen as sharing common values and working together to build an alternative future. This study focuses on the Alter-Globalization Movement to investigate whether there is an empirical basis for the positive convergence approach. Most of the research done on the Alter-Globalization Movement has focused on the participants at protest sites, which tends to overemphasize individual grievances at the expense of finding a shared common vision. I employ an alternative methodology by carrying out fieldwork across sixteen disparate communities in both the global North and South. Only by studying community practices in day to day life can we state whether a shared identity really exists. Following Karl Polanyi’s “double movement theory”, I look at how these communities are decommodifying man and nature by employing Standing’s formula of decomodification. Specifically, I analyze how Social Income increases by increasing Self Production and Community Benefits. I find that all the communities and organizations studied employ most of the following decomodification practices: subsistence farming, organic agriculture, composting, seed saving, Fair Trade, Community Supported Agriculture, sharing goods and services and community currencies. I argue that these decomodification practices produce a new lifestyle that removes the self from the artificiality of consumer culture, creating a new self. The ecological identity of the new self, centers on relationships rather than acquisition, constructing a new world of meaning and a social imaginary that may be more powerful than political movements in bringing about large scale social change.",1751296946,,Dissertations & Theses," Carpano, DanielaCarpanoDanielaCarpano, Daniela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3903378171 , 97445582 , 66569 , 9781339338934 , 3741558 , 3741558", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339338934, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751296946?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology"," Ecology , Environmental Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Antiglobalization movement , Decommodification , Ecological identity , Ecovillages , Gross national happiness , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reimagining+Development%3A+Understanding+the+Alter-Globalization+Movement+from+Ecovillages+to+Gross+National+Happiness&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carpano%2C+Daniela&amp;isbn=9781339338934&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"802,Intercultural Development: A Phenomenological Study of Post-Civil-Rights Black-Church Pastors,"Contemporary society is now a construct of vastly different multicultural experiences. The expansion of globalization and enculturation has presented individuals throughout the world the opportunity to engage in a heterogeneously global society. For individuals who lead in this multicultural environment, there are levels of engagement that were predicated first upon how individuals constructed their social identity and second how those individuals operate in an inclusive society. One of the earliest examples of multicultural engagement can be found in the establishment of the church. Church leaders for centuries have been encouraged to follow the mandate of multicultural and global engagement as found in the words of the Great Commission as described by the Apostle Matthew. For the church, the possibility of a racially inclusive church is extremely plausible. The quintessential example was found in the events described in the first chapter of the Book of Acts. Contemporary society still operates in a homogenously segregated construct that has forced the church to assume labels like the “Black Church”. For pastors, the inability to participate in a multicultural environment raises the question of whether or not pastors have the proper intercultural training necessary to cultivate a multicultural congregation. The Civil Rights Movement was a time of progressive thinking in the area of racial and social equality. Churches, which served as launching grounds for the movement, remained completely homogenous, with multicultural congregations being found less frequently than such historically defined churches as the black church or the white church.

It brings U.S. Latino/a and Latin American cultural production together in a hemispheric frame, examining art produced between 1998-2013 by artists in Argentina and Chicano/a and Mexican artists in the U.S. Through analyses of artworks and interviews with the artists, this dissertation posits a transnational generational formation of cultural producers aligned with leftist movements and ideologies -- specifically, those whose politics are anti-capitalist, anti-racist, anti-imperialist and/or decolonial. This generation and its artistic production is embedded in transformations brought about through neoliberalization, the influence of subaltern-popular movements organized in resistance to neoliberal and neocolonial forms of domination, as well as the decline of revolutionary nationalist paradigms that influenced the political formation of previous revolutionary generations. In addition to analyzing the myriad forms political art takes in the 21st century, this dissertation also uses politicized cultural production as a lens to consider aspects of counter-hegemonic struggles that easily fall outside representational frameworks within which these struggles are typically understood, including the way social movements participate in the production of subjectivity, these movements’ utopic dimensions, as well as the dissidence and dissent that attends popular struggles and their afterlives. The corpus of work examined in Art &amp; Politics Across the Americas includes activist street theater, counter-cartography, guerrilla interventions in public space, conceptual and site-specific art, counter-memorials, poetry, transmedia narrative and alternative reality gaming. This work is not only transdisciplinary; it is also extradisciplinary insofar as it passes beyond both the disciplinary limits and generic forms traditionally assigned to art and the aesthetic. This is seen in its integration of paradigms and methodologies from other fields (e.g. postcolonial historiography, direct action, solidarity economies), and in the ways that its means of production has led the art to function as an expressive element within broader social movements.

Chapters analyze Leslie Marmon Silko’s Almanac of the Dead, Helena Maria Viramontes’s Under the Feet of Jesus, and Thomas Pynchon’s Against the Day alongside worker-writers’ texts and testimonies, such as Fran Leeper Buss and María Elena Lucas’s Forged under the Sun / Forjada bajo el sol and The Heat: Steelworker Lives and Legends, a collection of United Steelworkers’ Institute for Career Development writings. In each of five chapters, this dissertation respectively discusses how literature can enact an inclusive definition of labor, amplify effaced labor voices, popularize workers’ counter-histories of labor conflict, provide an imaginative space for envisioning global social movements, and contribute to university students’ and union workers’ labor education. Each chapter in this dissertation grounds analyses of literary texts with discussion of parallel contemporary events and social movements. Specifically, thanatopolitical manipulations in Silko’s Almanac of the Dead are analyzed alongside the ongoing biopolitical expulsion and social rebellion occurring in Cananea, Mexico. Viramontes’s Under the Feet of Jesus and Buss and Lucas’s Forged under the Sun / Forjada bajo el sol are contextualized through community-based farmworkers’ organizations that combat injustice by promoting public awareness and fostering collective representation. Pynchon’s narrativization of the Colorado Coalfield War in Against the Day is related to workers’ and communities’ living memory of the Ludlow Massacre in present-day southern Colorado. Silko’s, Viramontes’s, and Pynchon’s literary visions of global counter-hegemonic social movements are analyzed in relation to contemporary United States labor organization and cross-border solidarity programs. Finally, considering multiple texts, including The Heat: Steelworker Lives and Legends, a collection of rank-and-file union member’s create writings, this dissertation provides examples of how to use literature to further university students’ and union workers’ labor education.",1758252283,,Dissertations & Theses," Wills, Ericka R.WillsR.ErickaWills, Ericka R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3926656131 , 101538852 , 66569 , 9781339413723 , 10001440 , 10001440", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339413723, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1758252283?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Biopower , Labor literature , Labor union , Pynchon , Silko , Viramontes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fan+the+flames+of+discontent%3A+Contemporary+labor+literature+and+social+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wills%2C+Ericka+R.&amp;isbn=9781339413723&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"805,The Power of Advocacy in Bridging the Ideological Divide: The Campaign for Human Rights and Corporate Responsibility in the Cocoa Industry 2001-2014,"A cornerstone of social work’s mission is to advocate for practices that create social justice. This study encourages social workers to broaden their advocacy efforts into the global arena and educate them about Transnational Advocacy Networks (TANs) that are fighting for equitable globalization policies. This longitudinal case study (2001-2014) explores the public debate surrounding human rights abuses in the cocoa industry. Qualitative framing analysis is employed to explore the stakeholders’ discourse surrounding both the causes of and solutions to the Worst Forms of Child Labor (WFCL). This study analyzes press releases from human rights activists, the cocoa industry, and the media in order to recount the debate’s history. Throughout the campaign, the TANs and cocoa companies conflicted over how to improve the Harkin-Engel Protocol and other policies designed to eradicate the WFCL. This study chronicles the TANs’ strategies and rhetoric used throughout the campaign against the WFCL. Findings include that intense early movement agitation, the practice of “naming and shaming,” mobilizing stockholder activists and strong resonant frames led to positive changes in the cocoa industry. This study recounts the cocoa industry’s reaction from denial of the problem to eventual acceptance of human rights as a corporate norm. Stakeholders ultimately transcended the conflict caused by contrasting ideological differences and created corporate social responsibility policies. It is essential for varied stakeholders to come together and bridge ideological divides in an effort to solve complex societal issues. This study encourages social workers to advocate for change in prevailing inequitable globalization policies. Social workers can play a vital role in envisioning a just world, and through partnering with advocacy networks, be architects of that world’s creation.",1759626289,,Dissertations & Theses," DeLuca-Acconi, Robin AnnDeLuca-AcconiAnnRobinDeLuca-Acconi, Robin Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3932223241 , 98125142 , 66569 , 9781339429878 , 10003928 , 10003928", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339429878, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1759626289?accountid=14496, 0452 Social work, 0452 Social work, 0452 Social work,, 0452 Social work, Social work," Social sciences , Adocacy , Child labor , Corporate social responsibility , Framing analysis , Human rights , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Power+of+Advocacy+in+Bridging+the+Ideological+Divide%3A+The+Campaign+for+Human+Rights+and+Corporate+Responsibility+in+the+Cocoa+Industry+2001-2014&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DeLuca-Acconi%2C+Robin+Ann&amp;isbn=9781339429878&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"806,Solidarity at Risk: The Politics of Attachment in Transnational Queer Palestine Solidarity and Anti-Pinkwashing Activism,"Solidarity is at risk. The provocation that frames the title of this project aims to intervene in the theorization of solidarity and the practices of transnational solidarity activism in the 21 st century. As a scholar embedded in the field, I take up the question of solidarity at risk to examine the practices of the transnational queer Palestine solidarity and anti-pinkwashing movement (the queer Palestine movement for short). In an era structured by the ideologies of neoliberalism, where free market globalization, privatization and individualism are reshaping the public sphere, the terms and practices of solidarity are shifting. Yet, theories of solidarity have remained embedded in older political frameworks, rooted in early social movement practices in the Marxist tradition or liberal democratic models of civic engagement. In a world changed by neoliberalism, we need new interpretive frameworks for analyzing and practicing solidarity today, not least because contemporary social movements require new ways of envisioning activist solidarity. Neoliberalism has also changed the geopolitical landscape of human rights. In what some queer theory scholars have called homonational times, we find the political stakes of queer solidarities embedded in the changing discourses of sexual rights. Looking at examples of solidarity at risk in the queer Palestine movement, this project maps the political stakes of homonationalism and neoliberalism in social movement practices. Examining cases of solidarity at risk in the queer Palestine movement, this project moves through various theories of solidarity: from transnational feminism, to political theory and philosophy, to queer and affect theories of social and political transformation. Across all these fields, I consider what binds us in solidarity, how our political attachments are important threads in theorizing solidarity, and how we might rethink our models of solidarity to sustain our political imaginings in neoliberal and homonational times.",1760593494,,Dissertations & Theses," Kouri-Towe, NatalieKouri-ToweNatalieKouri-Towe, Natalie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3934524821 , 101704302 , 66569 , 9781339413174 , 10001058 , 10001058", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339413174, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1760593494?accountid=14496," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," GLBT Studies , Middle Eastern Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Homonationalism , Pinkwashing , Queer theory , Social movements , Solidarity , Transnational feminism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solidarity+at+Risk%3A+The+Politics+of+Attachment+in+Transnational+Queer+Palestine+Solidarity+and+Anti-Pinkwashing+Activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kouri-Towe%2C+Natalie&amp;isbn=9781339413174&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"807,Formed by contact: Multi-local migration and contemporary narrative,"This dissertation examines how changes in migratory patterns under contemporary globalization have transformed late twentieth-century narratives of migration. This dissertation argues that post-1980s narratives radically depart from earlier forms of immigrant writing in that they attend to migratory journeys formed by dwelling across multiple nations. Traditionally, immigrant literature, in particular U.S. immigrant fiction, has been studied in light of the challenges of integration and permanent settlement. The tension arising from the immigrant subject’s ties to the country of origin and host country have been central to critical approaches to narratives of immigration. This dissertation argues that contemporary narratives complicate such binary logic by asking us to conceive border crossing movements in more global and multi-local terms. I argue that this newly emergent spatial logic is pronounced in two major ways. By focusing on the geographical orientation of contemporary migrant writing, this dissertation traces the changing place of the U.S. from a place of final destination and permanent settlement towards a node within a circuit of movements. I further argue that such expansion in geography is linked to the rise of transnational structures of intimacy within contemporary fiction for envisioning social and communal life. In order to examine multi-local migration as a global phenomenon affecting the lives of various diasporic populations, this dissertation employs a comparative frame for studying migrant writing. By illuminating inter-connections among a disparate body of ethnic writing rarely discussed together, it foregrounds the importance of a multi-ethnic approach for a nuanced understanding of migration in today’s globalized world.",1765199714,,Dissertations & Theses," Shin, Na MiShinMiNaShin, Na Mi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3953227711 , 100801702 , 66569 , 9781339464817 , 10010458 , 10010458", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339464817, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1765199714?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American literature , British and Irish literature , Ethnic studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , American literature , Emigration , Globalization , Immigrant writing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Formed+by+contact%3A+Multi-local+migration+and+contemporary+narrative&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shin%2C+Na+Mi&amp;isbn=9781339464817&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"808,Framing rights-claims: Collective identity groups in the Turkish public sphere,"This dissertation investigates how collective identity groups frame their rights claims in the public sphere by exploring what types of framing processes specific groups of activists adopt. My empirical focus is on how certain social movements in Turkey has framed their rights claims in the restrictive nature of the public sphere. What types of frames characterize these movements? This research explores three empirical case studies from Turkey - looking at an Islamic, a women’s rights and an LGBT organization. The main empirical finding of the dissertation is all three organizations endorse a liberal/universalistic frame to be accepted in the Turkish public sphere. The thesis of this dissertation is based on the analysis of the implications, consequences, and tensions that come out of this finding for democratic theory, theorizing Turkey, and social movements. In my analysis, I highlight a paradox in making rights-claims in Turkey. Collective identity groups demand group rights, but they frame these demands in terms of universal human rights language. The reason for the emergence of such paradox – I argue- is because groups want to fit in by adopting the universal language of rights used by the state in its Constitution and laws. Rights-based language could be necessary for certain groups as it is located “within the accepted discursive field resonating with the values of a secular society” (Barras 2009). Using macroframes, such as ‘human rights’, enable groups to appeal to international organizations, as well. This ‘postnational’ approach to rights-claiming can be part of the groups’ mandate to appeal to universal human rights beyond the borders of state sovereignty (Soysal 1998). The implication of this analysis is that social groups’ acts of citizenship conform to dominant frameworks of claims-making. This, in turn, limits their ways of claims-making. For instance, they do not make multicultural claims or challenge the universal citizenship of the liberal state. While each civil society organization under study challenges the secular, the patriachal and the homophobic nature of Turkish citizenship, they conform to the definition of Turkish citizenship which is liberal, universal and individualistic. The dissertation uses the qualitative case study method based on in-depth interviews with the members of the groups.",1766301004,,Dissertations & Theses," Tomen, BihterTomenBihterTomen, Bihter",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3957367441 , 98933482 , 66569 , 9781339477336 , 10012787 , 10012787", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339477336, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1766301004?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Activists , Collective identity , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framing+rights-claims%3A+Collective+identity+groups+in+the+Turkish+public+sphere&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tomen%2C+Bihter&amp;isbn=9781339477336&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"809,Building Counter-Power: A comparative study of student movements in Argentina and in Chile at the turn of the 21st century,"This project provides a comparative cross-national study of high school and university student power during the last decades in Argentina and Chile to assess the extent to which there is something specific about students vis-à-vis other social movements. The study analyzes contentious events to assess their main demands and repertoires of contention, their relations within a complex network of social and political organizations, generational continuities, and ruptures between student movements. Beginning with a critique of the individualistic and behavioral focus on social movement power, the study scrutinizes at the operation of social forces and institutional practices that eliminate overt conflict form the public agenda, and finds that students play distinctive roles in bringing previously unarticulated issues into explicit contention. Through a combined method approach, the study shows that; a) generational references and generational boundary-making are a paramount feature of student mobilization in the present; b) student´s identities have concrete effects on their selection of tactics and alliance-building; c) though students are impacted by process of global circulation of ideas, these are always mediated by the historical and contextual characteristics of conflicts; d) when students move outwards of the education system to make non-student demands, this process yields a thickening of social networks and social alliances. The comparison between Chile and Argentina shows that both the institutional arrangements of the existent educational systems and the nature of capitalism in both countries are fundamental elements for understanding the differences in terms of a) the perceived threat by authorizes, b) the degree of visibility and public support and c) the relative leverage exercised by student movements in both countries. Educational systems where the state plays a central role in regulation, management, delivery and financing have greater capacity to grant concessions and negotiate with students, avoiding ongoing escalation of conflicts.",1767658261,,Dissertations & Theses," Gonzalez Vaillant, GabrielaGonzalez VaillantGabrielaGonzalez Vaillant, Gabriela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3961130561 , 98745902 , 66569 , 9781339502632 , 10017534 , 10017534", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339502632, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767658261?accountid=14496," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," Education Policy , Latin American Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Education , Argentina , Chile , Countentious politics , Leverage , Students movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+Counter-Power%3A+A+comparative+study+of+student+movements+in+Argentina+and+in+Chile+at+the+turn+of+the+21st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gonzalez+Vaillant%2C+Gabriela&amp;isbn=9781339502632&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"810,Hactivism: Redefining what activists can do,"The importance of this project is to show that hacktivism has redefined the boundaries of what activists can do as well as the theoretical preconceptions of what is necessary to cause meaningful change and the creation of powerful social movements. The first chapter presents a literature review on social movement theory, that provides the theoretical context for the questions I explore in subsequent chapters. The following chapters are divided into three main research questions. Chapter Two addresses the first question: How does the non-territorial domain of cyberspace create new opportunities for activism? I argue that the Internet represents a unique location in which hacktivists engage each other and have bearing on the physical world and on the Internet itself. The research question I pose in Chapter Three is: How is power manifest differently in hacktivism compared to other forms of social movement strategy? This question follows the premise that social movements require large numbers of individuals to exercise greater impact. Hacktivists integrate individuals who are not technically adept at hacking into their activities. However, a single technically adept individual could cause as much if not more impact than a large group of individuals. The final research question I explore in Chapter Four is the following: Does hacktivism possess any distinct advantages over other forms of social movement protest, and if so, what are they? I show that the answer to this question has to do with the flexibility of hacktivism, which allows activists to use it effectively, on a global scale, against practically any target.",1771315924,,Dissertations & Theses," Weisz Argomedo, DanielWeisz ArgomedoDanielWeisz Argomedo, Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3974296941 , 94278812 , 66569 , 9781339513546 , 10020544 , 10020544", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339513546, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1771315924?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science"," International Relations , Political science"," Social sciences , Activism , Hacktivism , Social justice , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hactivism%3A+Redefining+what+activists+can+do&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weisz+Argomedo%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=9781339513546&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"811,Prosperity belief and liberal individualism: A study of economic and social attitudes in Guatemala,"Globalization has facilitated the growth of “market-friendly” religions throughout the world, but especially in developing societies in the global South. A popular belief among these movements is prosperity belief. Prosperity belief has several characteristics which make it compatible with liberal individualism, the dominant value in a globalized society. At the same time, its compatibility with this value may be limited, extending only to economic liberalism, but not to liberal attitudes on social issues. Data from the Pew Forum on Religious and Public Life’s 2006 survey Spirit and Power: Survey of Pentecostals in Guatemala is used to conduct a quantitative analysis regarding the economic and social attitudes of prosperity belief adherents in Guatemala in order to examine the potential, as well as the limits, of this belief’s compatibility with liberal individualism. Results suggest that support for liberal individualism is bifurcated. On one hand there is some support for the positive influence of prosperity belief on economic liberalism in regards to matters of free trade, but on the other hand, prosperity belief adherents continue to maintain conservative attitudes in regards to social issues.

The world-systemic analysis has attempted to understand the 1968 world revolution as a simultaneous mass uprising against the modern world-system. Instead of focusing solely on its simultaneity, this dissertation explores the transnational connections among the movements that emerged concurrently across the world, and argues that communication between the Japanese and foreign movements became a critical source of change in the political culture of Japanese civil society. Moreover, this dissertation claims that Japan’s transnational Sixties movement unintentionally and indirectly reinforced Japan’s position within the world-system rather than demolishing that system. To capture the role of transnational connections in the Japanese Sixties movement, this dissertation introduces the concept of “cosmopolitan publics,” defined as spaces where people and information from diverse national backgrounds come together and temporarily create stateless identities, leading to social change. By combining macro-structural analysis of transnational mobility with micro-analysis of transnational interactions, I first analyze the role of political magazines (Sogo-Zasshi), which engendered the image of “Global Revolt.” Then I examine how identities were transformed in the anti-Vietnam War movement (using Beheiren as a case study) as well as militant revolutionary activism (focusing on the Japanese Red Army) as a result of trust networks and communication with foreign movements in the First and Third Worlds. Consequently, the dissertation uncovers three essential effects of the cosmopolitan publics of the global 1960s. (1) They developed new ideas for promoting ethnic diversity and equality. (2) The Japanese movement became part of global networks of social movements that aimed to revise liberal democracy. (3) They led to the dissolution of undemocratic and militant tactics for rebelling against inequality. I conclude that Japan’s transnational Sixties movement contributed to reforming the liberal geoculture of the modern world system and as a result, strengthened Japan’s role in international society after the 1970s.",1775393541,,Dissertations & Theses," Takata, KeiTakataKeiTakata, Kei",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3993276481 , 97595432 , 66569 , 9781339546513 , 10036527 , 10036527", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339546513, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775393541?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0626 Sociology"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0626 Sociology"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0626 Sociology",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0626 Sociology"," Asian Studies , History , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cosmopolitan publics , Global sixties , Japanese new left , Politcal culture , Social change , Transnational networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cosmopolitan+publics+in+isolation%3A+The+Japanese+global+sixties+and+its+impact+on+social+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Takata%2C+Kei&amp;isbn=9781339546513&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"813,Transnational Islamism and political moderation: A comparative analysis of Egypt and Morocco,"This dissertation examines how transnationalism can affect Islamists’ moderation in both Egypt and Morocco. In this dissertation, I do an in-depth comparative case study analysis to assess the prospects of moderation of two Islamists political entities, the Muslim Brotherhood as a transnational social movement and the Morocco Party of Justice and Development (JDP), which has no transnational ties. Both the Muslim Brotherhood and PJD came to power after the Arab uprising in 2011 and were key players in the democratic transitions in both countries; however, the entities are not related. Further, the dissertation will explore the moderation level of the Muslim Brotherhood and PJD. Current literature on Islamists and moderation theory focuses on political inclusion, political learning and repression as factors that would affect the moderation of an Islamist group. Looking at Islamists as a transnational social movement is a new aspect in the study of Islamism. Recently, scholars have addressed the transnational aspect of Islamist social movements; however, these studies focused on radical Islamist groups such as Al Qaeda. To date, there has been no study to assess how transnationalism can affect the moderation level of Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. This dissertation attempts to fill that gap by assessing the moderation level of the transnational Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the Justice and Development Party in Morocco. Furthermore, extant studies have ignored transnational identity in conceptualizing “Trans national ism”. My dissertation corrects this gap by bringing this new element into consideration. In addition, most of the research conducted on the Muslim Brotherhood stops at 2012.

The dominant view at the global level favours prioritising financial performance and organizational self-reliance on the grounds that these are necessary if not sufficient for achieving sustained social impact over time. This has led to a focus in research on microfinance organizations (MFOs) that have sought transformation into registered financial institutions. In contrast, there has been less research into performance management of MFOs with strong NGO roots (referred to here as NGO-MFOs) who have prioritized social impact over growth and transformation. The thesis explores these issues for microfinance in India, starting with a systematic literature review of secondary evidence on its social impact. Two case studies of NGO-MFOs located in Tamil Nadu (ASSEFA and CRUSADE) then provide a more ethnographic perspective on social performance management and assessment. Case study data consists of participant observation, staff semi-structured interviews and organizational documents collected primarily during fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2013. These case studies document how NGO-MFOs view the ‘best practices’ of mainstream microfinance models (including financial performance) pragmatically while conceptualizing social performance according to their core values and social movement roots. They also illustrate how the mainstream view of social performance assessment (reflected by the review of impact evaluations) fails to capture the informal, flexible, and process-oriented approaches to social performance management pursued by some NGO-MFOs.",1780275214,,Dissertations & Theses," Humberstone, JulieHumberstoneJulieHumberstone, Julie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018939871 , 103733102 , 101309 , 10088732 , 10088732 , http://opus.bath.ac.uk/47041/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780275214?accountid=14496, 0508 Finance, 0508 Finance, 0508 Finance, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0508 Finance, Finance," http://opus.bath.ac.uk/47041/ , (UMI)AAI10088732 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Managing+for+organisational+self-reliance+and+social+impact+in+indian+microfinance%3A+alternatives+to+the+mainstream&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Humberstone%2C+Julie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"815,Gendered patriots and post-revolutionary ladies: Girl guiding and twentieth century Mexican girlhood,"Through the lens of the Guías de México (Girl Guides of Mexico), Gendered Patriots and Postrevolutionary Ladies examines Girl Guide efforts to advance international cooperation and peace by promoting international friendship among the world’s youth between 1919 and 1980. From its birth as a branch of the British Girl Guide Movement, Mexican Guides participated in the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scout’s (WAGGGS) international conferences, encampments, and global initiatives. During the first half of the twentieth century Western European and United States members established WAGGGS global agenda for social reform and the advancement of women and youth. At the same time Mexican women experienced the radical social and political transformations taking place in post-revolutionary Mexico, and evaluated the Guide Movement’s significance to their gender and culture. This dissertation serves as a case study to explore United States and British cultural imperialism across the twentieth century, and the ways in which Mexican women challenged imperialist assumptions while at the same time adapting and acculturating the fundamental principles of WAGGGS. The postrevolutionary reconstruction of gender in Mexico took place alongside first and second wave internationalist feminist movements through which women’s roles were contested and redefined. WAGGGS members viewed their association as feminist and egalitarian, and aimed to advance women’s rights and interests internationally. However, western leaders viewed themselves as guides who would teach their Latin American counterparts how to educate young women and girls, and saw United States and western European suffragist and feminist movements as a template for women’s progress abroad. Adolescence and womanhood were politicized, debated, and challenged in Mexico and internationally across the twentieth century. This study demonstrates how ordinary women who were Girl Guide members appropriated, challenged, and transformed global, national and local interpretations of women’s rights, roles, and biological and cultural representations, while at the same time supporting maternalist rhetoric with regards to their social position in society.",1780988691,,Dissertations & Theses," Kelly, MaryannKellyMaryannKelly, Maryann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4022311641 , 103962102 , 66569 , 9781339001289 , 3719595 , 3719595", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339001289, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780988691?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , European history , Latin American history , Womens studies , Political science , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Gendered patriots , Mexican girlhood , Post-revolutionary ladies , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendered+patriots+and+post-revolutionary+ladies%3A+Girl+guiding+and+twentieth+century+Mexican+girlhood&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kelly%2C+Maryann&amp;isbn=9781339001289&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"816,"The politics of international investment law: transnational corporations, social movements, and the struggle for the future","The aim of this thesis is to understand the political struggles that underpin international investment law. Social movements of various kinds have expressed alarm over an 'epidemic' of international legal challenges by transnational corporations against state measures designed to protect the environment, public health, or human rights. These state measures have often been introduced directly in response to hard-fought civil society campaigns (ranging from antimining protests in El Salvador to climate change campaigns in Germany), yet academic analysis of what is formally known as 'Investor-State Dispute Settlement' proceeds on the premise that these are simply disputes between 'investors' and 'states', as indeed the term implies. In turn, where the academic focus shifts towards wider questions of why this field of law emerged, and what role it plays in global politics today, even the investors disappear from view, and only states remain. The theoretical argument of this thesis is that the state is not an agent in political struggles, but a social structure that is both the 'congealment' of historic social struggles and a 'strategically selective' arena within which social struggles are fought today. This theoretical argument challenges the state-centric premises of the academic literature, and enables a different empirical explanation of the politics of international investment law, and of the 46 investment disputes arising out of environmental protection measures that have been selected for closer analysis. Drawing upon the work of scholars such as William Robinson, Stephen Gill, and David Schneiderman, the empirical argument of this thesis is that international investment law arose at the initiative of a transnational capitalist class, and it is designed to constrain the political agency of opposing social groups by 'locking in' policies that favour corporations. At stake in the struggle over international investment law is ultimately the very possibility for a different future.",1827511439,,Dissertations & Theses," Daniels, KatjaDanielsKatjaDaniels, Katja",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209716001 , 103733472 , 101309 , 10178534 , 10178534 , http://hdl.handle.net/2160/30061", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827511439?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/2160/30061 , (UMI)AAI10178534 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+international+investment+law%3A+transnational+corporations%2C+social+movements%2C+and+the+struggle+for+the+future&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Daniels%2C+Katja&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"817,The transformation of israeli peace activism since the second intifada,"This dissertation examines the transformation of Israeli peace activism since the second Intifada. Using a framework based in social movement theory it argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, not all parts of Israeli peace activism were paralysed in the period following the outbreak of the Intifada in 2000. By placing greater emphasis on the internal dynamics of social movement theory: collective action frames, tactical repertoires and mobilisation structures, and by building a three-fold typology of Israeli peace activism: a liberal Zionist component; a radical component; and a human rights component, it argues that it was only the liberal Zionist component that demobilised following the outbreak of violence in 2000. The radical and human rights component continued to mobilise, with new groups emerging, presenting alternative and innovative ways to challenge the prevailing situation. This study is based on interviews with activists in Israel, participant observation and primary data from the publications and websites of the activist groups, focusing on the period between 2000 and 2014. Through this, new empirical data to further the understanding of Israeli peace activism has been provided. This study further contributes to the literature on Israeli peace activism by unearthing new collective action frames, the evolution of tactical repertoires and a shift in the mobilising structures. Furthermore, by disaggregating the internal dynamics before analysing how they interact with the external environment, the political opportunity structures, this dissertation identifies different cycles of contention for the three components of Israeli peace activism. The empirical analysis has also led to contributions in the field of social movement theory. It shows that impact should be conceived of beyond the policy arena, with emphasis given to other areas of impact, such as mobilisation, cultural shifts and norm entrepreneurship. It also identifies a number of aspects of social movement theory that require refinement: the relationship between the government and a social movement; the connection between the international dimension and a domestic social movement; and the role of gender dynamics.",1827871255,,Dissertations & Theses," Fleischmann, LeonieFleischmannLeonieFleischmann, Leonie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4211387551 , 103716202 , 101309 , 10179394 , 10179394 , http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14051/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827871255?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14051/ , (UMI)AAI10179394 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+transformation+of+israeli+peace+activism+since+the+second+intifada&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fleischmann%2C+Leonie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"818,Les écovillages entre marginalité et droit à la ruralité: Un cas gaspésien,"Taking place between September 2013 and January 2015, this research is about social marginal initiatives in rural areas. Working for a local development, those initiatives promote the space appropriation by some themes like community, social movement and habitability. However, the marginality of those groups pushes us to questioning the impact for the rest of the territory. Our studies are based on Lefebvre (1974) theoretical thinking, the Right to the city, but, this time, applied to rural areas. In this sense, this research focuses on the space appropriation by the global community. Interested in ecovillages’ movement with the example of Hameau-18 (La Martre – Cap-au-Renard, Gaspésie-Îles-de-la- Madeleine), we think that the community of La Martre – Cap-au-Renard wants to be part of the Hameau-18 initiative ; that the Hameau-18’ projects push the local development ; and finally, that the Hameau-18 is able to mobilize the global community around the fight for the appropriation of the space. The methodologic aspects had been completed by twenty semi-structured interviews with three different groups: some ecovillage’ members; citizens of La Martre – Cap-au-Renard; and regional development experts. The conclusion of the research is that, in spite of the social, politic, and economic dynamism creating revendicative movement for the rigth to rural territories, Hameau-18 is still a marginal project. Nervertheless, the social links creating by this initiative are consolidating a collective expertise for social change.",1884809385,,Dissertations & Theses," Lemarier-Saulnier, GabrielleLemarier-SaulnierGabrielleLemarier-Saulnier, Gabrielle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321486047 , 111412652 , 66569 , 9781369671186 , 10586840 , 10586840", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781369671186, French, French,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1884809385?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Les+%C3%A9covillages+entre+marginalit%C3%A9+et+droit+%C3%A0+la+ruralit%C3%A9%3A+Un+cas+gasp%C3%A9sien&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lemarier-Saulnier%2C+Gabrielle&amp;isbn=9781369671186&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"819,"Immigrants in the sexual revolution: Perceptions, participation, and belonging, the Netherlands and Denmark, 1960s-80s","This is an historical study of first-generation immigrants in Denmark and the Netherlands in the 1960s-80s and their perceptions of the “Sexual Revolution.” Foreign workers and post-colonial immigrants arrived during the same decades when laws regarding women’s equality, contraception and abortion, homosexuality, pornography, adultery and divorce were challenged and reformed, in many cases in the context of intensive social movement activism. This research explores immigrants’ perceptions of the dramatic changes in sexual and gender relations transforming Europe in the 1960s-80s, and the instances of immigrant solidarity with, and participation in, networks for social justice, women’s equality, and sexual liberation. Part I of this dissertation focuses on foreign workers’ early impressions of gender equality and sexual liberality from 1965-1974. Part II centers on immigrant activism from 1975-1985; during this time, left-wing immigrant groups in the Netherlands gained strategic and rhetorical inspiration not only from anti-fascism, but also from the women’s movement. Immigrant women—both actively, and just by being present—challenged European feminists to consider seriously the roles of ethnicity, race, and cultural difference in the women’s movement. Part III focuses on immigrants and ethnic minorities in gay and lesbian “scenes” (e.g. bars, social circles) and formal organizations in the 1960s-80s. During these decades, contact advertisements in gay and lesbian journals facilitated new friendships, romances, housing connections, employment, and travel opportunities across both internal and external borders (e.g. inter-ethnic and international correspondence). Interviewees recount their experiences “coming out,” moving to cities, and being “one of the first” people of color in various gay and lesbian networks in these decades.

When international students graduate, they can transition from an international student to a skilled migrant. Yet their decision-making process to stay in the receiving country (the United States), to return to sending countries, or to move on to another country, at different stages of such transition period, is not presently understood. This dissertation examines the experiences of these “migrants in transition period” when they face the “to return or to stay” choices under structural and institutional forces from the sending and receiving countries. This research adopts the conceptual framework of human capital, social capital, and cultural capital, to investigate how social capital and cultural capital impact the economic outcomes of migrants’ human capital under different societal contexts, and how migrants in the transition period cope with such situations and develop their stay or return plans accordingly. It further analyzes their decision-making process for return during this transition period. The empirical study of this dissertation investigates contemporary Chinese student migrants and skilled migrants from People’s Republic of China to the United States, as well as Chinese returnees who returned to China after graduation with a US educational degree. Findings reveal the impact of social and cultural capitals in shaping career experiences of skilled Chinese migrants, and also explore their mobility and the decision-makings of such movement of talent.",1762244249,,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, WanYuWanYu, Wan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3941147621 , 101859222 , 66569 , 9781339443393 , 10006583 , 10006583", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339443393, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1762244249?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Chinese skilled migrants , Highly skilled migration , International students",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Chinese+Student+Migrants+in+the+Transition+Period+in+the+United+States%3A+From+Human+Capital+to+Social+and+Cultural+Capitals&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Wan&amp;isbn=9781339443393&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"821,"Frontier Internship in Mission, 1961-1974: Young Christians abroad in a post-colonial and Cold War world","Frontier Internship in Mission (FIM) was an experimental mission project conceived of and run by Presbyterian Student World Relations director Margaret Flory between 1961 and 1974. It was broadly ecumenical in concept and execution and closely tied to the World Student Christian Federation community. Recent college or seminary graduates were assigned to live and work with local people who were connected in some way to the global ecumenical network and who had invited them. They worked on projects mutually agreed upon, usually for two years. One hundred fourteen of the 140 Americans who originally participated and eight of the original 20 international participants were interviewed for this study. Their narratives about their life histories and experience during and after these international partnerships offer an intimate look at one group of largely mainline Protestant Americans born in the 1930s and 1940s, and the social and religious institutions that were their avenues to engagement with the wider world at a time of cataclysmic change. Over the thirteen years of FIM program operation considered here, conditions in the forty-eight different countries where Frontier Interns (FIs) served were transformed by movements for independence and by escalating covert and overt American intrusions. The core of this dissertation presents regionally-organized internship case studies highlighting the impact of those encounters on the FI’s Christian and American identities . It also analyzes the rejection of their witness when they returned home. Moving forward with their lives, Frontier Interns reaffirmed their commitment to “right relations” of mutual respect across difference and most often gravitated to social roles as bridge-builders and interpreters, domestically and internationally. The strong internal opposition to global ecumenism that had developed in some mainline Protestant churches changed the relationship of many FIs to those churches. It is argued here that the Frontier Interns’ experience highlights a societal shift from a moral order based on covenant or social contract to one that privileged the unrestrained exercise of power and interests. A covenantal commitment to mutual global partnerships is central to who the FIs are, their internships, and what they did with their lives subsequently.",1767228348,,Dissertations & Theses," Focer, Ada J.FocerJ.AdaFocer, Ada J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3960133561 , 102313302 , 66569 , 9781339491301 , 10015279 , 10015279", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339491301, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767228348?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology"," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology"," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology",," 0320 Religious history , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology"," Religious history , International Relations , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Cold War , Ecumenical protestant , Post-colonial mission , Student Christian Movement , World Student Christian Federation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Frontier+Internship+in+Mission%2C+1961-1974%3A+Young+Christians+abroad+in+a+post-colonial+and+Cold+War+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Focer%2C+Ada+J.&amp;isbn=9781339491301&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"822,"Uncertain citizenship: Race, empire, and the denationalization of Asian Americans in twentieth-century United States","While scholarship on immigration and Asian American history has frequently focused on the relationship between immigration and naturalization restrictions and the actions of people who were subjected to them, this body of work has generally assumed US citizenship to be a stable legal category once it is attained and has ignored the possibility of citizenship loss for Asian Americans. “Uncertain Citizenship” intervenes in this scholarship by providing a social, legal, and cultural history of cases where US citizens of Asian descent were legally divested of their US citizenship through administrative procedures of denaturalization and expatriation. Through an analysis of legal proceedings, government correspondence, and other archival materials uncovered in the archives of the Department of Justice and the Department of State, this project uncovers the as-yet untold stories of Indian Americans who were denaturalized in the early twentieth century for not being white, and Japanese Americans who were expatriated after World War II for voting in Japanese elections, serving in the Japanese armed forces, or taking up employment with the Japanese government. These cases, which comprise the most systematic and targeted instances of denationalization in US history, demonstrate how transnational constructions of race and empire were vital to the development of norms of US citizenship. In addition, this dissertation argues that the threat of citizenship loss also served as a disciplinary mechanism that policed certain citizen behaviors such as split national identities or participation in subversive or “deviant” acts. It served as a potent reminder to citizens that failure to adhere to citizenship norms could get them expelled from national membership and made it clear to Asian immigrants that their acceptance into the nation was precarious and conditional at best. By placing citizenship loss in a transnational context, this project makes significant contributions towards understanding the impact that the transnational movements of peoples and ideas has had on the development of the American nation, state, empire, and concept of citizenship.",1767459644,,Dissertations & Theses," Agarwal, KritikaAgarwalKritikaAgarwal, Kritika",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3961088781 , 102338542 , 66569 , 9781339480442 , 10013498 , 10013498", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339480442, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767459644?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American history , Asian American Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Asian-American , Citizenship , Denaturalization , Expatriation , Immigration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Uncertain+citizenship%3A++Race%2C+empire%2C+and+the+denationalization+of+Asian+Americans+in+twentieth-century+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Agarwal%2C+Kritika&amp;isbn=9781339480442&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"823,Sanctification as virtue and mission: The politics of holiness,"This dissertation considers the political implications of the doctrine of holiness. I proceed by demonstrating the neglect of holiness in political theology, the viability of the holiness movement as an embodied witness of the political implications of the doctrine of holiness, and a biblical trajectory in Leviticus that extends into the New Testament. I describe this scriptural holiness as vocation for all of God’s people through personal formation and outward societal action to extend God’s holiness. With attention to the approaches of political theology and formation, I demonstrate that the holiness movement of the nineteenth century offers an example of holiness in practice that addresses societal problems (e.g., urban housing crisis, intemperance, and slavery). I then propose three theological issues that undermined the political vision of the holiness movement in the twentieth century. First, the scope of sin narrowed resulting in a less hopeful expectation of sanctification’s power. Second, most of the holiness movement adopted premillennial eschatology, which altered the way it viewed social structures. Third, the holiness movement was marginalized by its theological rejection of the Third Great Awakening, which served to influence religious and civil approaches to social problems in the twentieth century (e.g., the New Deal and Social Gospel). Three case studies (race, global missions, and temperance) demonstrate the influence these respective theological shifts had on social action. I argue that a theological interpretation of Leviticus 17-26 guides the holiness movement to embody the vocation of holiness as an alternative vision to the formation of modern politics regarding social orderings. I extend Israel Knohl’s insight that Lev 17-26 responds to prophetic critiques of cultic practices and reconceives holiness to address social challenges. I argue that Jesus picks up this stream when he recites, “love your neighbor as yourself,” and that Christian embodiment of this Scriptural holiness sustains the political vocation of holiness in changing contexts (including the modern bifurcation of life into private and public spheres). I conclude that vocational holiness enables a Christian understanding of political community.",1785369696,,Dissertations & Theses," Willowby, NathanWillowbyNathanWillowby, Nathan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4039309081 , 103178742 , 66569 , 9781339648729 , 10101022 , 10101022", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339648729, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1785369696?accountid=14496," 0321 Biblical studies , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology"," 0321 Biblical studies , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology"," 0321 Biblical studies , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology",," 0321 Biblical studies , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology"," Biblical studies , Ethics , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Holiness , Holiness movement , Leviticus , Political theology , Prohibition , Sanctification",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sanctification+as+virtue+and+mission%3A+The+politics+of+holiness&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Willowby%2C+Nathan&amp;isbn=9781339648729&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"824,Consciousness and Resistance in Chicano Barrio Narratives,"Chicano barrios in the U.S. are commonly represented by mainstream media as sites of cultural difference, poverty and delinquency. Prior to the Chicano Movement, barrio communities were relatively invisible in dominant American society. The limited academic literature on barrio communities tended to focus on the social problem of delinquent youth and the barriers to successful cultural assimilation. Similarly, prior to the late 1960s there were very few published literary works that offered authentic self-representations of barrio communities. Nevertheless, when Chicanos seized the tools of representation and established presses that were committed to publishing literature about the Chicano experience written by Chicanos, a wave of literature emerged, including narratives that focused on life in the barrio. In comparison to mainstream representations of the barrio, Chicano barrio narratives offer a deeper understanding of the various forms of political, social and economic displacement that produce poverty and delinquency in barrio communities. In addition to complicating negative stereotypes about the barrio, these narratives demonstrate how Chicano communities resist cultural subordination and challenge social injustice. The recreation and affirmation of a mestizo cultural identity, despite its perceived inferiority by the dominant class and at times at the risk of social and legal repercussions, is one form of internal resistance. Other forms include the development of ideologies such as Chicanismo and Indigenismo, and the use of indigenous spirituality as organic Chicano epistemology. The strategies of resistance represented in barrio narratives are informed by a consciousness that is grounded in a Chicano, or mestizo, worldview. Chicano consciousness, in its various manifestations from creative cultural production and social activism to academic and theoretical investigations, is inherently oppositional. Accordingly, alongside a well established Chicano literary tradition, there exists a tradition of Chicano scholarly research that stands in opposition to ideologies that support a dominant hierarchical social order that subordinates people of color. Together, they represent a counter-discourse that parallels, and often converges with, other contemporary de-colonial and indigenous movements that are taking place on a global platform. In this study, historical, political, and theoretical studies produced by Chicano scholars are engaged in a discussion on the underlying consciousness and strategies of resistance that are represented in barrio narratives. It is my contention that the relative isolation of barrio communities speaks to its social marginalization at the same time that it allows for greater cultural autonomy. After providing a historical context for the emergence of Chicano barrio narratives in the first chapter, three key features in the barrio narratives written by Mario Suárez during the Pre-Chicano period are identified and analyzed in the second chapter. The third and fourth chapters show how nationalist ideologies fueled collective resistance in a selection of barrio poems, plays and essays of the Chicano Movement. Finally, in the fifth chapter, I examine spatial perceptions and oppositional consciousness in relation to the figurative boundary that isolates barrio communities in two coming-of-age barrio novels.",1787839542,,Dissertations & Theses," Nez, Ana ArellanoNezArellanoAnaNez, Ana Arellano",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4050676561 , 104604352 , 66569 , 9781339671390 , 10103573 , 10103573", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339671390, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1787839542?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Comparative literature , American literature , Hispanic American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Barrio narratives , Chicana/o literature , Consciousness , Indigenismo",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Consciousness+and+Resistance+in+Chicano+Barrio+Narratives&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nez%2C+Ana+Arellano&amp;isbn=9781339671390&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"825,"Binding Freedom: Cuba's Black Public Sphere, 1868-1912","My dissertation studies the cultural, social, and political associations linked to the civil rights movement in Cuba during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which witnessed the abolition of slavery, the crumbling of colonialism and the entrance of black intellectuals into formal politics. I trace the emergence of a black public sphere and analyze the networks of communication among people of color in Cuba and the wider Black Atlantic through sources that include antislavery narratives, the black press, court cases and secret police records. I argue that people of color in Cuba, enslaved and freed alike, engaged in political and intellectual activity throughout the nineteenth century and played a much more active role in shaping the way race relations, blackness and Cuban identity were formed than intellectual and political histories tend to show. A driving question of “Binding Freedom” is how collective consciousness is articulated through print culture and converted into social movements. Thus a major thrust of the study centers on the limitations of antislavery narratives as well as the social and economic hurdles the black press encountered and of the ways in which the consumers and producers of the papers negotiated these difficulties. The second half of the project focuses on the transition from colonialism to “colorblind republicanism” to map how the black press and civic organizations adapted their discourse and tactics to confront new forms of social and political oppression. As an analysis of a transnational public sphere forged by black people in Cuba, the Caribbean and the US, this dissertation contributes to our understanding of the social formation of diasporic communities, black political thought and Cuban social and intellectual history.",1789549611,,Dissertations & Theses," Sotelo Eastman, AlexanderSotelo EastmanAlexanderSotelo Eastman, Alexander0000-0001-5353-9470",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4059497041 , 104471082 , 66569 , 9781339670508 , 10103484 , 10103484", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339670508, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1789549611?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Latin American literature , Latin American history , Ethnic studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Abolitionism , Black press , Print culture , Public sphere , Racial harmony , Social history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Binding+Freedom%3A+Cuba%27s+Black+Public+Sphere%2C+1868-1912&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sotelo+Eastman%2C+Alexander&amp;isbn=9781339670508&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"826,"The crescent and the cross: Examining the connections among religious identity, national identity, and patterns of political action","In light of the steady increase in immigration to Scandinavian countries, transnational migration and its impact on European national identity is a growing focus of study. Are ideas of European secularism shifting as a result of diversifying populations, and if so how? In the context of religion, there has been analysis devoted to understanding how religion can be a central tool for immigrants gaining social capital, adapting into a new society, and mobilizing politically to assert rights. Conflicts between religious values and national identity have spurred political action; however, the majority of these studies focus solely on religious and ethnic minorities in the community. In contemporary Europe, many have looked at Muslims and how their participation in Islam affects their understandings of national identity. This literature often treats Muslims as a separate from the mainstream; little attention is paid to how their ideas are similar to or different from those of other faith based groups. In order to understand if participation in a religious community influences experiences with marginalization and political participation, both the perspectives of religious and ethnic minorities as well as the religious ethnic majority must be accounted for. This dissertation uses case material collected from a year-long doctoral research study of both Christians and Muslims in Norway to answer: how is political participation affected by religious participation among those who are in the margins of dominant discourses of national identity? By drawing fruitful comparisons between both Christians and Muslims who struggle to negotiate their religious ideas with Norwegian dominant discourses of religious history, ethnicity, and secularism, this research reveals how cultivating a sense of belonging to a greater national narrative is a pivotal factor in motivating people to become active in social and political movements for change. In conclusion, individuals who successfully navigated between both their religious and secular social circles to develop a privatized idea of faith were more likely to be engaged in political movements beyond their respective houses of worship and ethnic enclaves. In comparison, those who possessed more closed social circles and cultivated less investment in national identity narratives were less active in political movements for change even if they experienced injustice first hand.",1789611272,,Dissertations & Theses," McKown, LaurenMcKownLaurenMcKown, Lauren0000-0003-4325-7079",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4059673501 , 104526012 , 66569 , 9781339679891 , 10104455 , 10104455", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339679891, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1789611272?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Connections , Crescent , Cross , Identity , National , Political , Religious",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+crescent+and+the+cross%3A+Examining+the+connections+among+religious+identity%2C+national+identity%2C+and+patterns+of+political+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKown%2C+Lauren&amp;isbn=9781339679891&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"827,Government policy and initiatives on maternal mortality reduction in Nigeria,"This research is a case study of the decline in Nigeria’s maternal mortality ratio from 1990 to 2013. The goal was to examine the reasons behind the decline. Using a combination of ideas from Eager (2004) and Nathanson (1996) as the theoretical framework, this study explained the factors that resulted in the decline. Both theorists focus on the processes of normative change relative to public health outcomes at a societal or international level. Available secondary or documentary data were used for this study. Data sources include: Nigerian government reports on maternal health interventions; non-governmental reports on maternal health interventions; reports from other government and international agencies; and information on social activists groups. Data were analyzed using key indicators developed from theoretical framework. These indicators relative to maternal health included: interventions or actions by the government; the role of active social movements; influence of international agencies; and statements by “transformative actors” which fit with the process of the social construction of maternal mortality as a societal concern. Key findings show that even though social movements and other transformational actors contributed to the decline, the maternal health interventions by the Nigerian government had the most continuous impact on the 2013 maternal mortality decline. Also the decline was largely due to the active collaboration between transformational actors as well as alliances between local and international social movements and actors.",1796035021,,Dissertations & Theses," Eto, Enifome U.EtoU.EnifomeEto, Enifome U.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4087237061 , 105708472 , 66569 , 9781339726724 , 10109386 , 10109386", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339726724, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796035021?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0293 African Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0293 African Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0293 African Studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," African Studies , Womens studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Decline , Government policies and initiatives , Maternal health , Maternal mortality , Nigeria , Reduction",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Government+policy+and+initiatives+on+maternal+mortality+reduction+in+Nigeria&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Eto%2C+Enifome+U.&amp;isbn=9781339726724&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"828,"The Arab Spring Abroad: Mobilization among Syrian, Libyan, and Yemeni Diasporas in the U.S. and Great Britain","In 2011, the Arab Spring revolutionary movements that erupted across the Middle East galvanized supporters in the diaspora to work collectively for regime change and relief at home. Existing theories argue that diasporas residing in democratic states possess the requisite political opportunities and resources to mobilize on behalf of their home-countries and intervene in significant ways. However, this explanation cannot account for why diaspora movements only emerge and play a role in home-country crises under certain conditions. This dissertation therefore investigates 1) how members of the Libyan, Syrian, and Yemeni diasporas in the US and Great Britain mobilized to support the 2011 uprisings, and asks 2) why the pace of their public emergence as regime opponents, their degree of intra-movement solidarity, the strength of their roles in the revolutions, and the short-term outcomes of their efforts varied significantly by national group. In order to explain this variation, this study analyzes three sets of data using grounded and process-tracing methods: 240 original interviews; ethnographic participant observations of Syrian-American pro-revolution events; and secondary sources on the diasporas and the revolutions. The findings demonstrate that diaspora mobilization dynamics are shaped by multi-level and relational factors that not only include political opportunities in the host-country, but also conditions in and diasporas’ relations with relevant actors in the home-country —including sending-state regimes and opposition movements—and relevant third-parties, such as journalists and international institutions. I find that quotidian disruptions to any one of these conditions and relations produce corresponding changes in the strength and longevity of diasporas’ collective actions. This study also demonstrates that activists overcome obstacles to transnational mobilization posed by hostile external conditions when they divert resources to establish full-time formal advocacy organizations. Though this strategic adaptation constrains their tactics, movements that do not make this adaptation are likely to die off. The establishment of a transnational organizational field also improves the capacity of diasporas to pursue rights and recognition in both the home- and host-countries over time. I conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings for the study of social movements, diasporas, and conflict.",1796357366,,Dissertations & Theses," Moss, Dana M.MossM.DanaMoss, Dana M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4088448961 , 102844432 , 66569 , 9781339829029 , 10124805 , 10124805", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339829029, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796357366?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Arab Spring , Collective action , Diasporas , Social conflict , Social movements , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Arab+Spring+Abroad%3A+Mobilization+among+Syrian%2C+Libyan%2C+and+Yemeni+Diasporas+in+the+U.S.+and+Great+Britain&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moss%2C+Dana+M.&amp;isbn=9781339829029&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"829,"Media, globalization and nationalism: The case of separate Telangana","Theorists of globalization tend to presume the declining centrality of nationalism as an explanatory focus for understanding global power relations. This dissertation argues that far from declining in significance, nationalism encompasses both hegemonic and counter-hegemonic, mediatized processes of power struggle, processes that draw increasingly from resources that are both internal and external to geographic domains of conflict, and in a manner that re-patterns power relations at the local, national, regional and global levels. This project examines the relationship between media, nationalism and globalization in Telangana and its relationship with marginalized groups in the region, with a particular focus on the media practices of Telangana activists such as production of pamphlets, use of online forums and access to mainstream television, radio, print media and social communication. This dissertation argues that despite not having a media of its own, and in spite of hostility of established Telugu media, the Telangana movement furthered its goals to strategic use of one-to-one and one-to-many media that operated in an oral culture. The success of the movement can be credited as much if not more, to bringing sections of Telangana society disaffected by globalization through nationalist mobilization since the mid-1990s as it could be the politically opportune moment in 2013 when the Telangana Bill was passed by the parliament. The movement is noted for being largely peaceful and employed non-violent strategies, although it can be argued that the suicides by young people were instances of self-inflicted violence.",1796914162,,Dissertations & Theses," Inukonda, SumanthInukondaSumanthInukonda, Sumanth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4089704241 , 105839612 , 66569 , 9781339724638 , 10109166 , 10109166", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339724638, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796914162?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass communications",," 0459 Communication , 0700 Social structure , 0708 Mass communications"," Communication , Social structure , Mass communications"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Globalization , India , Media , Mediatization , Nation-state , Nationalism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Media%2C+globalization+and+nationalism%3A+The+case+of+separate+Telangana&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Inukonda%2C+Sumanth&amp;isbn=9781339724638&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"830,"Catacombs christianity and sympathetic democracy: An analysis, criticism, and application of Jane Addams' democratic theory","Many people know Jane Addams as a Progressive Era leader, pioneering the Settlement House movement with Hull House in Chicago, and later leading an international women’s peace movement during World War I that ultimately led to a Nobel Prize. Addams was one of the most famous American women at the time of her death, celebrated as a moral exemplar and a trailblazing social thinker and advocate. She continued to be acknowledged for her social advocacy work, but her constructive contributions to academic fields such as sociology, philosophy, and religious studies have only begun to be recovered in the past few decades. This dissertation analyzes Addams’ theory and praxis as a source for religious ethics in the context of a pluralistic democracy. Addams published most of her work on democracy before women were able to vote in the United States, and her marginal social position informs a conception of democracy that exceeds the mechanics of elections.

In its initial manifestation, the Bill threatened to penalize “aggravated homosexuality” with the death penalty. The media attention earned by the proposed legislation opened avenues for transnational cooperation and communication between US-based Human and LGBTI Rights organizations and Ugandan kuchus – a Ugandan identity that encapsulates various identities of same gender loving or gender nonconforming peoples. This project focuses on this transnational relationship as it interacts with the dynamic of organizing in the midst of a national project of sexual repression. This dissertation asks how kuchu organizing functions from a position dually marginalized by homonationalism, the process through which dominant, Western nations deploy a normativized, nationalist homosexuality for global legitimacy, and homophobic nationalism, the domestic process of making a state ‘straight.’” This question divides into three constituent questions: 1) Is the human rights regime a vehicle of homonationalism? 2) How does homonationalism interact with homophobic nationalism in Uganda? 3) How does this intersection affect local organizing strategies and alliance building? I detail how the structure of transnational advocacy, which aims to empower global human rights activism, restructures and, in some cases, limits local movements. Specifically, I find that and explore how the funding practices and strategies of US organizations and foundations can create economic and political inequalities in Uganda. This analysis complicates and contributes to theories of sexual and gendered citizenship, nationalisms and transnational social movements.

This dissertation reconstructs the intellectual origins of the movement and its principal institutions, showing how ecumenical ideas and practices were transformed in response to geopolitical cataclysms, such as World War I, the collapse of European order in the 1930s, the Cold War, and decolonization, that divided international Protestant and Orthodox elites in the North Atlantic and Asia. Focusing on church leaders and lay intellectuals like John Mott, Joseph Oldham, Emil Brunner, Karl Barth, Willem A. Visser’t Hooft, John Foster Dulles, and M. M. Thomas, the project shows how a new relation between Christian faith and politics emerged from Protestant-led efforts to internationalize religious authority. Seeking to manifest world unity through common faith, ecumenists successively redefined the meaning of Christianity in their efforts to secure international consensus on the public role of the church among a politically polyglot constituency that included liberals, conservatives, communists, and fascists. This dissertation argues that the ecumenical movement went through three stages between 1900 and 1952: the first oriented around building the Kingdom of God on earth (1900-1925), the second seeking the realize the worldwide church as the basis of universal community (1930-1950), and the third mobilizing Christians for political revolution (1946-1952). The focus of the dissertation – chapters 2 through 5 – concerns the rise and decline of the ecumenical project to realize the church, which I argue was the first systematic and internationally successfully effort to articulate “ecumenicity” as a form of Christian pluralism. I show how this project was grounded in a missionary theology of anti-secularism that attributed a breakdown of social and international order to modern civilization’s repudiation of God. First defined at a conference of the International Missionary Conference in 1928 as a new “system of life and thought” that had displaced other religions as Christianity’s chief global rival, “secularism” identified an enemy that Allied and German Protestants, estranged since World War I, could unite in opposing. Mobilizing dialectical theology against the “totalitarian” claims of the state and the cogito alike, ecumenical anti-secularists jettisoned the historicist theological liberalism on which earlier forms of Protestant internationalism was based. In the 1930s, organizations like the Universal Christian Council of Life and Work and the World Council of Churches institutionalized theological dialogue as a mode of submission to God’s sovereignty; for the architects of these bodies, Christian faith was the only possible basis of community life in an age of global fracture. A strategy of international consolidation that ascribed political polarization to spiritual alienation, the ascendant anti-secularism of the 1930s did not anathematize the Nazi-sympathizing Reich church but sought to incorporate it into a world Christian community prioritizing the subordination of “political” to religious loyalties. After 1948, however, the ecumenical program to realize the church collapsed as its leaders struggled to surmount the ideological divisions of the Cold War. While Eastern European church leaders attacked the World Council as a mask for Western imperialism, critics in the West attacked the Council as an agent or stooge of world Communism. To escape the ideological impasse of East and West, the movement turned to the Third World in search of a new basis of global Christian unity. Reinventing the ecumenical project in the postwar world, a younger generation of theologians from the global South argued that the universal fellowship of the church would be actualized not by overcoming politics, but by specifying political commitments in solidarity with the liberation struggles of the poor, the non-white, and the colonized. In this paradoxical denouement, those struggling to surmount internal political divisions embraced political action as the essential expression of religious faith, and Christianity, long declared to be the basis of social order, came to be seen as its revolutionary solvent. By locating the ecumenical movement within a history of the ideas that made its institutional functioning possible, this project breaks from common narratives that lodge the movement within trajectories of secularization that rely on problematic attempts to adjudicate the boundaries between theological and non-theological thought and practice.",1802907651,,Dissertations & Theses," Reynolds, JustinReynoldsJustinReynolds, Justin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4113492981 , 106381482 , 66569 , 9781339926384 , 10134136 , 10134136", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339926384, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1802907651?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0615 Political science",," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0615 Political science"," Religion , Religious history , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Ecumenism , Intellectual history , Internationalism , Modern european history , Protestantism , Secularization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Against+the+World%3A+International+Protestantism+and+the+Ecumenical+Movement+between+Secularization+and+Politics%2C+1900-1952&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reynolds%2C+Justin&amp;isbn=9781339926384&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"833,"Food Sovereignty on the Ground: Export Agriculture, Peasant Communities, and the Indigenous Movement in Ecuador","Food sovereignty is an alternative development model that values local, sustainable food systems. The national and international social movements that promote food sovereignty do so on behalf of small peasant farmers, whom they claim practice sustainable production for local consumption. Scholarly and activist discourse associates peasant and indigenous groups with environmental protection and resistance to globalization. Yet, doing so creates an essentialist image of this historically marginalized ethno-class that obscures contemporary market integration. Drawing on six months of field research with indigenous peasants in the highlands of Ecuador, this dissertation argues that the environmentalist goals of the food sovereignty movement do not reflect the lived realities of small farmers. Comparing quinoa, broccoli and dairy farmers with heterogeneous production practices and market links, this study finds that indigenous peasants want to supply the global market. Based on their negative experiences with local market intermediaries and positive experiences with export organizations, feeding fellow Ecuadorians is not a widespread ideal. In addition, respondents defend their reliance on agro-chemicals and imported inputs as necessary for their livelihood. Those who practice sustainable production methods do so in order to access a certified organic and Fair Trade export market that offers a better price. For these indigenous peasant farmers, on the ground, livelihood security is more important than environmental ideals. The food sovereignty tenets that resonate most with community members are the redistribution of resources and government investment in the small farm sector. As a continuation of the classic struggle for agrarian reform with a new environmentalist cloak, the food sovereignty movement must not lose sight of its economic justice roots. Initiatives to improve the global industrial food system through local, sustainable agriculture must also create viable livelihood options for poor communities of color.",1807959763,,Dissertations & Theses," Soper, Rachel StarflowerSoperStarflowerRachelSoper, Rachel Starflower",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4134294761 , 106422832 , 66569 , 9781339833750 , 10125282 , 10125282", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339833750, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1807959763?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Agriculture , Communities , Ecuador , Export , Food , Ground , Indigenous , Movement , Peasant , Sovereignty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Food+Sovereignty+on+the+Ground%3A+Export+Agriculture%2C+Peasant+Communities%2C+and+the+Indigenous+Movement+in+Ecuador&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soper%2C+Rachel+Starflower&amp;isbn=9781339833750&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"834,"""If there wasn’t farming, somebody wouldn’t eat"": Small scale agriculture, community autonomy, and food sovereignty in Mississippi","This thesis examines the historical context of small scale farming and grassroots social movements in Mississippi’s history, and investigates the ways small farmers and community advocates are drawing upon their land-based heritage and local knowledge systems to create community-controlled food systems in dialogue with broader national and global conversations about sustainable agriculture and food sovereignty. Employing a multi-scalar method of analysis, the research studies issues from the perspective of individuals, communities, institutions, as well as national and transnational systems. The work draws from previous scholarship in environmental studies, agroecology, critical race studies, rural sociology, critical historiography, agrifood studies, and regional studies to further a person-centered critique of industrial agriculture. It uses the scalar model to connect Mississippi’s history of small scale farming, black land loss, and grassroots social movements to global human rights struggles and the food sovereignty movement. The original research suggests that individuals with strong senses of place and commitments to community are integral to sustainability in local food systems.

I examine the Project Meshnet community’s endeavor to create a decentralized alternative to the current, global Internet infrastructure as residing both in the context of decentralized but still institutionally-guided technology production and in the context of recent social movements characterized by de- centralized, non-hierarchical power structures, mutual aid, and other features. I conducted this research using the participant-observation method along with in-depth, one-on-one interviews. I present most of my findings in the tradition of “thick description’, detailing Project Meshnet and its broader, technical and social contexts. While Project Meshnet’s official focus remains on the scientific pursuit of building a more secure and stable computer network, participants often provide a political impetus for their participation in terms of rectifying uneven political and economic power distributions. This appears as participants seek to use their technology to subvert centralized control over network access (i.e., by Internet Service Providers) and as they frame their model of decentralized, non-hierarchical participation as a possible template for other kinds of political action, in the vein of prefigurative strategies employed by social movements. As a kind of free software project mixed with overtly political ideals of technological and social decentralization, Project Meshnet embodies its politics within its scientific practice while that practice enables a means for subtle, decentralizing political action, even as participants reflexively shape their public image, broaden their scientific aims, and work",1809823651,,Dissertations & Theses," Gardner, Garreth BlakeGardnerBlakeGarrethGardner, Garreth Blake",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4141052301 , 106955422 , 66569 , 9781339855370 , 10127500 , 10127500", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339855370, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1809823651?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Decentralization , Network infrastructure , Scientific/intellectual movement , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Project+meshnet+and+the+politics+of+scientific+practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gardner%2C+Garreth+Blake&amp;isbn=9781339855370&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"836,"&lt;i&gt;Feminicidio,&lt;/i&gt; Transnational Legal Activism and State Responsibility in Mexico","This dissertation uses the concept of transnational legal activism to analyze the mobilization of international human rights law as a multi-scalar process that produces and is shaped by gendered political and discursive opportunities. I apply this framework to examine how feminist grassroots activists engaged with supranational human rights institutions, especially the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, to hold the Mexican state responsible for the murders of three young women in Ciudad Juárez, an industrial city that borders the United States, in the case of González and Others “Cotton Field.” The Court declared that Mexico had failed to act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, and punish these crimes. These murders epitomize what activists identified as feminicidio, the systematic killing of women in a context of institutionalized gender discrimination sanctioned by the state; this phenomenon has prevailed in the northern state of Chihuahua where Ciudad Juárez is located since the 1990s. The dissertation also investigates how federal and local state actors responded to grassroots activists’ claims and the judgment of the IACtHR, including the criminalization of feminicidio. Through interviews with Mexican activists and frame analysis of the IACtHR judgment and of federal and local parliamentary debates, I argue that grassroots activists’ involvement in transnational legal activism contributed to expanding and rearticulating the meaning of women’s human rights and state responsibility at the domestic and supranational levels. Throughout, I highlight activists’ agency in this process and in their interactions with transnational organizations specialized in human rights advocacy and supranational litigation. Thus, I challenge assumptions in the literature on human rights and social movements that imply that grassroots actors have a limited access to international law and avenues to participate in transnational advocacy. Last, I suggest that the actions of Mexican grassroots activists extend a Latin American approach to international human rights law.",1811427771,,Dissertations & Theses," Garcia Del Moral, PaulinaGarcia Del MoralPaulinaGarcia Del Moral, Paulina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4147509541 , 103396572 , 66569 , 9781339927596 , 10134265 , 10134265", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339927596, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811427771?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0626 Sociology"," Law , Womens studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Femicide , Feminicidio , Inter-American human rights system , International human rights law , Mexico , Transnational legal activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Feminicidio%2C+Transnational+Legal+Activism%0Aand+State+Responsibility+in+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garcia+Del+Moral%2C+Paulina&amp;isbn=9781339927596&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"837,"Selling Mexico: Race, gender, and American influence in Cancun, 1970-2000","Selling Mexico highlights the importance of Cancûn, Mexico's top international tourism resort, in modern Mexican history. It promotes a deeper understanding of Mexico's social, economic, and cultural history in the late twentieth century. In particular, this study focuses on the rise of mass middle-class tourism American tourism to Mexico between 1970 and 2000. It closely examines Cancún's central role in buttressing Mexico to its status as a regional tourism pioneer in the latter half of the twentieth century. More broadly, it also illuminates Mexico's leadership in tourism among countries in the Global South. First, it focuses on early tourism projects in Mexico in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It also highlights the changes in relations between Americans and Mexicans, in part as a result of the Good Neighbor Policy, during this period. The increased friendliness between Americans and Mexicans was important in Mexico's ability to garner more tourism from the U.S. during this period. As a result, Mexico became more dependent than before on American tourism and tailored its hospitality holdings to American tourists' market demands. This study also examines the role of ideologies in Mexico's state-led tourism development, including Pan Americanism, internationalism and nationalism. It studies Pan Americanism and internationalism in tourism promotions abroad and at home. It also looks at the state's attempts to foster pride in national patrimony in order to promote a unified national identity and encourage more Mexican nationals to travel throughout their nation. This coincided with the government's development of the ""social tourism"" sector in the 1970s. In this way, Selling Mexico expands the historical record on the state's post-revolutionary nation-building projects and promotes a re-examination of tourism in relation to nationalism and Mexico's cultural history in the latter half of the twentieth century. In addition, this study analyzes state-led tourism planning and its historical relationship to the development of Cancan. In that same vein, it illuminates the state's motivations for tourism development, interpreting it as a strategy to promote economic development as well as a method to quell leftist resistance movements which were surging in the Mexican countryside during the 1960s and 1970s. It also contextualizes mass tourism during the Jet Age. In addition, Selling Mexico analyzes the intersecting relationship between capitalism, race, class, and gender in tourism. It promotes a critical analysis of these connections by examining the impact of indigenous communal ejido land expropriations, city planning, beach privatization, hiring practices, and tourism promotions on the development of Cancún. Selling Mexico interprets Cancún as a cultural borderland. It closely studies the convergence of foreign and domestic people, culture, and capital in Cancún. It looks at Cancún's identity as a transnational ""no-place,"" where culture and ""authenticity"" take on new meanings in the age of globalization and free trade. It also interrogates the tensions between Mexican ownership and international enterprise, arguing that in the era of neoliberalism, they are often unified due to the growing presence of large and ever-expanding international partnerships and conglomerates. Finally, it examines the state's control of its international image abroad. In an industry susceptible to perceptions of public safety, image was considered to be essential to expanding tourism. Therefore, it carefully examines how the state dealt with international reports of drug trafficking, natural disasters, violence, and kidnapping in Mexico. As an in-depth study of Cancún, Selling Mexico uses tourism to more closely examine the intersections between race, class, gender, capitalism, culture, and international relations.",1813312421,,Dissertations & Theses," Butler, Tracy A.ButlerA.TracyButler, Tracy A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4156110491 , 107279722 , 66569 , 9781369042962 , 10149171 , 10149171", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369042962, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1813312421?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations",," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," Latin American history , Latin American Studies , International Relations"," Social sciences , Cancun , Gender , Mexico , Nationalism , Race , Tourism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Selling+Mexico%3A+Race%2C+gender%2C+and+American+influence+in%0ACancun%2C+1970-2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Butler%2C+Tracy+A.&amp;isbn=9781369042962&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"838,"""Homophobia is a crime!"": An ethnography of a political demand","""Homophobia is a Crime!"" is an ethnography of political experience that accompanies LGBT activists across sites critical to contemporary Brazilian governance. Activists with whom I worked declared this time as both a ""watershed era"" for gay and transgender recognition and a time when ""homophobia [had come] out of the closet."" Diverse readings of current events reflected activists' uncertainties about the increasing attention elected politicians and media commentators placed on LGBT politics. Since political democratization in the 1980s, sexual politics were often treated as secondary to economic development, and LGBT activists could accrue incremental victories with little organized opposition. LGBT advocacy had become central to Brazilian statecraft in areas ranging from municipal urban planning to international diplomacy. But growing visibility combined with the consolidation of conservative evangelicalism created a new source of antagonism. Contrary to activists' political expectations, the more visibility LGBT people gained in the public sphere, the more public opposition to their political agenda increased. International observers called these events a 'culture wars' turn in Brazilian politics, but many of my interlocutors approached the new political terrain with confusion. Established solidarities on the left and common vocabularies around modernity, citizenship, and human rights no longer seemed to resonate. Working with activists who advocated for hate crime legislation, I observed activists struggle to make political claims while the rhetorical and material grounds for those claims were shifting. I describe this experience as one of political disorientation. The concept responds to a set of empirical questions initiated by the intensifications of social mobility, political realignment, and public attention to LGBT people in Brazil. Political disorientation is also a broader theoretical description of a structure of feeling that attaches itself to the indeterminacy of modern democracy. A first dissertation section on activist cultures begins with Chapter 1, ""Disorganized Civil Society,"" which examines a cohort of gay and lesbian activist younger activists who resisted the NGO structure of mainstream LGBT organizing and used social media to craft an alternative political commons. 'Disorganized' activists demonstrated the limits of that commons when they attempted to establish solidarity with black and trans activist groups, with limited success. Chapter 2, ""Participants and Partners, But Not Partisans,"" recounts LGBT summit meetings where civil society organizations and state actors jointly reviewed and amended LGBT public policies. The chapter outlines contemporary grammars of Brazilian social movements, which mix participatory democratic initiatives with transnational civil society partnerships. The second section narrates campaigns to combat homophobia. Chapter 3, ""Homophobia Out of the Closet,"" shows the panorama of anti-homophobia discourse as it emerged in journalist accounts of violence, speeches of elected officials, and social movement demands. The chapter inquires as to the ethical and epistemic challenges to creating and enfleshing the category of homophobia. Chapter 4, ""A Sense of Violence, The Feel of Statistics,"" analyzes the process by which an LGBT counterpublic sense of violence became materially remediated into statistics that could transmit public affect. Activists demanding more robust statistics focused on material production of statistics on anti-LGBT violence--reporting mechanisms, bureaucratic flows of data. Rather than scientific accuracy, activists demanded democratic participation in making statistics. A final section examines protest aesthetics and affect. Chapter 5, ""I'll Put My Mouth Where I Please,"" examines the role of protest aesthetics and affect in suturing political claims from distinct identity groups. The protest chant for which the chapter is named emerged as a broad demand for a politics of sexual liberation, free speech and drug recreation at a series of São Paulo 'Freedom Marches' in 2011. In an analysis of the Portuguese syntax of the eponymous protest chant that combines the present indicative with the future subjunctive, I demonstrate how activists rhetorically employed the emptiness of democratic claim to form broad solidarity.",1813732875,,Dissertations & Theses," Sosa, Joseph JaySosaJayJosephSosa, Joseph Jay0000-0002-2923-1588",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4157460031 , 107307522 , 66569 , 9781339874395 , 10129548 , 10129548", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339874395, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1813732875?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies"," Cultural anthropology , GLBT Studies"," Social sciences , Activism , Affect , Brazil , Lgbtq , Public culture , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Homophobia+is+a+crime%21%22%3A+An+ethnography+of+a+political+demand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sosa%2C+Joseph+Jay&amp;isbn=9781339874395&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"839,"The Religious Origins of Transnational Relief: Calvinism, Humanitarianism, and the Genesis of Social Fields","There has been a growing interest in the origins and nature of the long-distance humanitarian NGO sector in recent years. Some scholars have seen humanitarian activism as a relatively new phenomenon, which can be ascribed to a post-World War II commitment to global justice and welfare. Conversely, other scholars have highlighted the long-standing historical origins of humanitarian activity and sentiments, and have traced them back to the eighteenth-century and beyond. In this, it remains unclear why the most dominant markers of the contemporary humanitarian community—the Red Cross, the Geneva Convention, and the professional humanitarian worker—emerged in the nineteenth-century, and how they accrued the symbolic and political sway they currently hold. In this dissertation, I trace the emergence of the humanitarian sector by examining the late-nineteenth-century establishment of the Red Cross, as well as its expansion and lasting effects on the humanitarian community. I draw on archival research in the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Library of Geneva, and news archives, as well as books and pamphlets published by Red Cross societies and other humanitarian organizations. I draw equally on cultural sociology and social field analysis, in order to analyze the transformation of humanitarianism from an ad-hoc charitable activity into an international professional sector, and to understand its symbolic prominence in the global civil sphere. The case of the Red Cross also provides an excellent opportunity to reexamine the assumptions of Bourdieusian field analysis, which typically obscures field origins by bracketing them from any rigorous analysis, and to offer a cultural framework for studying social fields. The first chapter examines the processes that led to the establishment of the Red Cross movement in the 1860s. It focuses on the religious context that gave rise to the calls to establish a network of impartial aid societies. The chapter shows that the founding members of the movement drew on Calvinist convictions specific to the Réveil movement of the mid-nineteenthcentury in order to conceptualize humanitarianism as an impartial and neutral endeavor. Theoretically, the chapter approaches the emergence of new fields as a cultural process, which is driven by values and belief rather than economic or political interests. The second chapter shifts focus to the late-nineteenth-century and traces the mass expansion of the Red Cross Movement and its contribution to the specific logics, rules, and ethos of the transnational humanitarian field. It demonstrates that the movement enjoyed transnational success because it was adaptable to local and national belief systems. At the same time, it shows that the movement permeated internationally an ethical framework defining the nature of humanitarianism and prescribing types of roles and positions that make it possible. In this, the chapter shows that the expansion of fields across national boundaries relies on narratives and symbols being recast in multiple nations so as to fit local cultural and social structures. The third chapter evaluates the effects of this expansion on the adjacent fields of international law, journalism, and nursing. Here, I demonstrate that each field developed symbiotic relations with the nascent humanitarian field, which in turn reinforced and institutionalized humanitarian organizations. In the analysis, I show how the Red Cross provided multiple parties with cultural categories by which to articulate and advance processes within their own fields. The fourth chapter assesses the continuity of this nineteenth-century framework by analyzing the emergence of Doctors without Borders in the 1970s. Although the latter movement has been one of the sharpest critics of the Red Cross, this chapter shows that this criticism was waged within the preexisting logics of their field. I show that while Doctors without Borders introduced new ways of acting in the humanitarian field, it remained oriented toward a conception of humanitarianism that was established more than a century earlier. Across these chapters, I argue that the humanitarian field accrued its symbolic power through the interaction of the religious imprint the nineteenth-century ICRC bore with the concerns and cultural schemas of multiple parties across national contexts and professional communities. By examining how the humanitarian sector evolved, this research sheds light on the genesis of new social fields, and specifically highlights the role of culture therein. In this, it demonstrates how religious belief contributed to contemporary civil society institutions by identifying how Calvinist convictions gave rise to the infrastructure of the world of humanitarian NGOs.",1816149436,,Dissertations & Theses," Dromi, Shai MordechaiDromiMordechaiShaiDromi, Shai Mordechai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4168357991 , 107526132 , 66569 , 9781369088809 , 10153759 , 10153759", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369088809, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1816149436?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Calvinism , Humanitarianism , Red Cross",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Religious+Origins+of+Transnational+Relief%3A+Calvinism%2C+Humanitarianism%2C+and+the+Genesis+of+Social+Fields&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dromi%2C+Shai+Mordechai&amp;isbn=9781369088809&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"840,Un arte social y revolucionario (A Social and Revolutionary Art): Marcelo Pogolotti and the International Avant-Garde,"Un arte social y revolucionario: Marcelo Pogolotti and the International Avant-Garde, examines the work of Marcelo Pogolotti (b. 1902, Havana – d. 1988, Havana), a key figure in the Cuban vanguardia , through his participation in a number of transnational art movements and artists’ groups. Although he is today little recognized outside of Cuba, Pogolotti spent the majority of his career in Europe in the 1930s, where he was fully integrated into the international avant-garde, first as an associate of the Turin Futurist group in Italy, and then as a member of the Paris-based Association des Artistes et Écrivains Révolutionnaires (AEAR). This latter collective of politically engaged artists and writers profoundly influenced Pogolotti, and led to the development of his mature artistic production. Characterized by an abstracted figurative style, Pogolotti’s mature works reveal his engagement with the political and social upheaval of inter-war Europe and reflect his efforts to create what he termed, “a social and revolutionary art.” As the first extended study about the artist written in English, this dissertation offers a greater understanding of the contribution of this important painter to the development of figurative art with a political inflection in Cuba as well as in France and Italy, the two countries where he spent the majority of his creative years. Chapter one introduces the historical and cultural context that shaped Pogolotti’s life and early career. Critical to this chapter is a discussion of Pogolotti’s participation in the exhibitions that defined Cuba’s vanguardia generation and his relationship to his Cuban artist peers. The second chapter addresses Pogolotti’s early years abroad, opening with a comparison to other Cuban artists who nostalgically referenced Cuba while in Paris. In contrast, Pogolotti’s interest in a more universal aesthetic, based “more in the time than the place,” led him to incorporate mechanomorphic imagery. This approach coincided with the interests of the Turin Futurist group with whom Pogolotti became involved. Strongly opposed to fascism, how Pogolotti navigated his position amongst the Futurists will be considered through an analysis of the manifestos and exhibitions in which the Cuban artist participated. Pogolotti’s 1930-31 drawing series, Nuestro Tiempo ( Our Time ), is the focus of the third chapter. Composed of thirty-five works, this series depicts explicit political and social commentaries about contemporary issues such as capitalism and corruption, and merits focused study as the major aesthetic and political turning point in Pogolotti’s career. Chapter four addresses Pogolotti’s involvement with the AEAR, whose political and intellectual milieu informed the development of Pogolotti’s mature phase paintings. Of particular focus will be his 1933 Cuban Landscape (Figure 4), Pogolotti’s most recognized canvas. Traditionally interpreted in terms of cubanidad , by reinscribing this work within the context of Pogolotti’s participation in the AEAR, this chapter presents a new interpretation of this canonical painting based on Pogolotti’s political commitments and the particular historical moment. The final chapter considers how the exhibition history and critical reception of Pogolotti’s art impacted his subsequent historiography. Beginning with an analysis of Pogolotti’s first and only solo exhibition in Paris, the chapter then turns to the reception of Pogolotti’s work upon his return to Cuba in 1939, considering how it differed from that of his contemporaries. The dissertation concludes with a consideration of how recent reevaluations by Cuban scholars may reflect a reclamation of Pogolotti’s radical political perspectives in terms of Cuban Revolutionary ideology, as well as a renewed interest in promoting the international nature of Cuban culture.",1820910684,,Dissertations & Theses," Temkin, Susanna V.TemkinV.SusannaTemkin, Susanna V.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4186814471 , 102533392 , 66569 , 9781339950648 , 10139579 , 10139579", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339950648, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1820910684?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Art history , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Association des ecrivains et artistes revolutionnaires , Cuba , Futurism , Pogolotti, Marcelo , Realism , Vanguardia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Un+arte+social+y+revolucionario+%28A+Social+and+Revolutionary+Art%29%3A+Marcelo+Pogolotti+and+the+International+Avant-Garde&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Temkin%2C+Susanna+V.&amp;isbn=9781339950648&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"841,"From Africa to Europe, youth and transnational migration: Examining the lived experiences of Nigerian migrant youth in Malta","Innovations in communication and transportation industries have improved and increased the potential for the movement of individuals, commodities, and capitals across international borders as they respond to global environmental and socio-economic stimuli. Extant studies have focused on adult transnational migrants, and youth migration is highlighted only in relation to the adult experiences. However, movement of young adults as independent transnational migrants is an emerging trend in international migration. There is a general lack of awareness on the working and living conditions of youth migrants. This research was therefore informed by the urgent need to understand the migration experiences of youth with the view of protecting young migrants and ensuring that migration leads to their development and those of their home and host countries. The thesis employs data collected with interpretative phenomenological analysis, IPA in a qualitative field study conducted in 2013 in the Republic of Malta to examine the lived experiences of Europe-bound migrant Nigerian youth. By resisting the banal Push and Pull explanations for transnational migration, which literally blames migrants and the countries of origin for current trends in global migration, the thesis advances the understanding of global youth migration from the perspectives of Indigenous world views, anti-colonial, and antiracist theories. It disturbs, and by so doing, unpacks as colonial project, the existing dominant imaginaries around immigrants from the developing world. These imagined mindsets have informed immigration policies and praxis that have continued to generate and sustain the migrant other. The study uncovered the enormous transit and settlement challenges that transnational migrant youth contend with as they are polarized into social and demographic opposites (male and female migrants, legal and illegal, citizen and alien) by the advanced border-surveillance technologies and authorities of receiving states.

This dissertation examines international migration as both a source and consequence of social forces in an increasingly globalized world. It focuses on migration to the universalist welfare states of Nordic Europe, which have transformed from largely homogenous societies to ones that are ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse. At question is how migration is shaped by Nordic destinations and immigrant origins and whether universalism can endure the sociocultural transformations that accompany new immigrant populations. This dissertation contributes to the international migration literature by identifying factors that go beyond the economic, demographic, and geographic influences known to shape migration. I use a unique bilateral migration dataset to test the welfare magnet hypothesis, which suggests that generous welfare attracts migrants, for the most robust welfare states in the world and representatives of other welfare types. I find virtually no evidence for a welfare magnet hypothesis and instead find that institutionalized commitments to equality and international human rights shape Nordic migration. In addition to destination characteristics, I fill a gap in current knowledge on migration flows by examining factors specific to immigrants' origin countries. I conduct a series of novel analyses, first globally, by World-Systems regions, and finally for Nordic migration with a focus on the origin. I find that South-North migration is driven by World-Systemic influence like capital penetration, whereas South-South migration is more strongly associated with connectedness factors like socially-transmitted remittances. Nordic-bound migration is distinct from typical South-North migration as it is not significantly tied to capital movement and is instead influenced more by destination characteristics. Across all types, origin conflict is a significant predictor of international mobility. Finally, I analyze what migration-led diversity means for the bases of universalism by examining individual-level social trust and welfare support across 17 European societies. I draw from theories of ethnic boundary making, citizenship, and nationalism to show that while ethnic diversity often impacts social cohesion directly, particularly welfare support, much of its effects are shaped by histories of conquest and conflict.",1824673803,,Dissertations & Theses," Ponce, AaronPonceAaronPonce, Aaron",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4199712891 , 106169882 , 66569 , 9781339988283 , 10143617 , 10143617", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339988283, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824673803?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Global south , Migration , Nordic , Social trust , Welfare state , World-systems",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migration+and+universalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ponce%2C+Aaron&amp;isbn=9781339988283&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"843,Constraints on Diplomacy: &lt;i&gt;The Rise of Right-Wing Political Cultures in Israel&lt;/i&gt;,"In recent years, extreme right parties have received considerable electoral support and mounting influence in Israeli politics.

For Indigenous people, the systemic violence against them works to erase all Indigenous identities from dominant non-Indigenous societies. Even as Indigenous identities in general are targets of systemic violence, there are two subgroups within a larger Indigenous community that are targeted for violence more often than the overall Indigenous community –Indigenous women and those individuals who identify in ways that deviate from the dominant society’s preferred heteronormative and gender-binary identities. Queer Indigenous people and Indigenous women represent the minority of a minority who are hunted in an effort to erase their divergent identities entirely. Through the examination of prose, film, poetry and social movements, I will address the question of how these Indigenous peoples can begin to recover from this systematic violence against two of their subpopulations through the creation of memorials to the victims. Through memorialization, Indigenous populations return power and agency to these victims and continue a quest for justice that will offer psychological healing for victims, their families, and a larger Indigenous population. Through the process of memorializing the divergent and individual identities of these victims of sexuality, gender, and gender expression driven violence, art and social media begin the process of obtaining justice through rediscovering and revalidating these identities. Chapter One explores questions of jurisdiction in crimes against Native women as presented in Louise Erdrich’s novel The Round House . The jurisdictional challenges faced by Geraldine Coutts and her family following her sexual assault and attempted murder prevent justice from being served against her attacker. Without justice, Geraldine and her family are not able to heal fully from the trauma of the crime. Chapter Two discusses the documentary Finding Dawn and Canada’s Indigenous women. Christine Welsh, the film’s director, tells personal stories of some of the victims of violence against Indigenous women in Canada in an effort to begin a larger conversation about the systemic attacks against Indigenous women and the lack of attention these victims receive from the Canadian government. Welsh’s documentary gives faces to a few of the names on Canada’s list of missing and murdered Indigenous women and memorializes the victims in very personal ways so that their families may begin to heal. Chapter Three addresses the poetry of Qwo-Li Driskill, and explores hir use of memorial to heal psychological wounds in “Love Poems for Billy Jack,” “Chantway for FC,” and “Gay Nigger Number One.” Driskill’s representation of queer Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and the systemic violence against them re-humanizes the victims in an effort to return power to the powerless. Chapter Four explores the ongoing social movements guided by the hashtag #MMIW (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women) on social media and by public protests in the United States and Canada as global attention is drawn to the violence against Indigenous women and communities. Social media, protests, and ongoing conversations with governments show that the violence against queer Indigenous people and women is not isolated to the pages of literature or the frames of a screen – it is a situation that must be addressed in order to begin to change the settler colonial system that seeks to erase Indigenous identities by violently attacking populations. Like the works of Erdrich, Welsh, and Driskill, the social movements seek to bring wider attention to the violence against Indigenous women and queer Indigenous people. The combined efforts of literature, film, and social movements draw attention to the injustice these people face and demand social change.",1825302922,,Dissertations & Theses," Frederico, AmandaFredericoAmandaFrederico, Amanda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4202279771 , 108144962 , 66569 , 9781339986623 , 10143447 , 10143447", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339986623, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1825302922?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0627 Criminology , 0740 Native American studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0627 Criminology , 0740 Native American studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0627 Criminology , 0740 Native American studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0627 Criminology , 0740 Native American studies"," Womens studies , American literature , Criminology , Native American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Driskill , Erdrich , Finding Dawn , Indigenous , MMIW , Round House",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Memorializing+Individuals%2C+Seeking+Justice+for+Communities%3A+The+Epidemic+of+Systemic+Violence+Against+Indigenous+Peoples+and+the+Role+of+Art+and+Public+Response+in+Bringing+About+Social+Change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Frederico%2C+Amanda&amp;isbn=9781339986623&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"845,"Communicative Care Across Borders: Language, Materiality, and Affect in Transnational Family Life","In recent years, scholars of language and social life have grappled with the implications of increasing global connection for the field’s foundational concepts. Addressing lacunae in such research, this dissertation takes a bottom-up approach to the study of language and mobility, starting with the linguistic practices of everyday life to demonstrate how such communication produces and reproduces the forms of social organization through which human movement is experienced and understood. Inspired by foundational work and emerging theories within linguistic anthropology that argue separately for the importance of materiality and affect, the dissertation suggests that incorporating the linguistic, the affective, and the material into a single analytical framework productively elucidates the implications of cross-border ties. The dissertation illustrates the analytical purchase of this unified approach through an examination of everyday communication in transnational families living stretched between El Salvador and the United States. Utilizing a multisited methodology that analyzes the complete circuit of transnational life, the dissertation studies how such mundane cross-border conversations sustain family belonging. The analysis draws on interdisciplinary feminist research on care to suggest that these interactions instantiate communicative care, a novel concept developed through the dissertation’s examination of three specific communicative practices. The first analytical chapter explores transnational greetings, demonstrating how this everyday ritual constructs and maintains affective kin ties in ways that ultimately support the material well-being of family members who are economically dependent on migrant remittances. The subsequent chapter analyzes these material negotiations in greater detail, elucidating the deft linguistic practices through which the families protect their ongoing relationships while managing the profound economic inequalities that characterize their cross-border lives. The final analytical chapter explores how families remember together in transnational conversations, building scenarios of idealized family life that link memories of the past with imagined togetherness, thus interweaving the materiality of embodied personas as well as their affective orientations. Through this analysis, the dissertation contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of language and mobility, shedding light on the fundamental imbrication of materiality, affect, and language in such experiences.",1825633670,,Dissertations & Theses," Arnold, LynnetteArnoldLynnetteArnold, Lynnette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4203210611 , 104603862 , 66569 , 9781369146493 , 10159721 , 10159721", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369146493, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1825633670?accountid=14496," 0290 Linguistics , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication"," 0290 Linguistics , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication"," 0290 Linguistics , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication",," 0290 Linguistics , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication"," Linguistics , Cultural anthropology , Communication"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Care , Communication , Family , Language , Migration , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communicative+Care+Across+Borders%3A+Language%2C+Materiality%2C+and+Affect+in+Transnational+Family+Life&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arnold%2C+Lynnette&amp;isbn=9781369146493&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"846,Via Vietnam: Racial Coalition and Social Collapse in Transnational Protest Art (1965-1975),"During the height of the American led wars in Southeast Asia, roughly 1965–75, a global anti-war movement produced hundreds of posters, short films, illustrated print publications, and other quickly reproducible and widely distributable objects of protest art. While eclectic in form, style, content, and national provenance, these works comprise what I assert constitutes a global genre of twentieth century art and visual culture, formed around a shared strategy of linking local politics with the issue of Vietnamese solidarity. Whether they functioned as active documents of protest against state policies during the war, or were conscripted into later state-authored projects of post-war historicization and reconciliation, these anti-war art works drew broad historical and thematic connections between Vietnam and other political episodes not necessarily or intrinsically understood as belonging together. With the decision to represent ‘oneself,’ or the constituency to which one belongs, alongside and in comparison with an image of ‘Vietnameseness,’ works such as these constructed a version of Vietnam able to service a wide range of political claims. In this way, which is to say via Vietnam, locally specific struggles were joined to larger geopolitical contexts to forge a pan-revolutionary sensibility that was as tenuous and circumstantial to the war itself as it was potentially paradigm-shattering to the greater social realities exceeding it. Written in four chapters each dedicated to a specific body of archives in the US, Vietnam, Jordan, and Australia, “Via Vietnam: Racial Coalition and Social Collapse in Transnational Protest Art, 1965–1975,” is an analysis of the Vietnam-centric iconography and aesthetic programs of the transnational anti-war left. The first half of the dissertation argues that the widespread visual conflation of Vietnamese subjects with other local, revolutionary identities had unintended consequences, and that these aesthetic constructions meant to demonstrate cross-movement solidarity had the effect of reinforcing some of the very social categories they had attempted to dismantle. The second half of the dissertation analyzes subsequent iterations of the anti-war movement’s visual tactics in later state-sponsored visual productions, such as archives, museums, and memorials. I examine the influence of the global anti-war aesthetic and ethos on sites of official and national historicization of the war, in order to more broadly articulate the political and aesthetic gestures that animated artistic efforts to isolate, cultivate, and circulate a nation-specific image and subject in the service of multiple other transnational projects.",1826358027,,Dissertations & Theses," Hatton, BrynnHattonBrynnHatton, Brynn0000-0001-9308-874X",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4206334901 , 105227972 , 66569 , 9781369155679 , 10160660 , 10160660", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369155679, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826358027?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Protest art , Vietnam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Via+Vietnam%3A+Racial+Coalition+and+Social+Collapse+in+Transnational+Protest+Art+%281965-1975%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hatton%2C+Brynn&amp;isbn=9781369155679&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"847,"A critical perspective on social ecology and urban crises: learning about, with and from urban social movements in rio de janeiro","We are currently facing incredible challenges due to environmental and social crises on a global scale and cities are at the forefront of these challenges.

It does so by critically engaging with social ecology, a theory continuously developed by Murray Bookchin from the 1960s onward, which, while critiquing current social and ecological crises, provides a vision and theory of action needed to achieve a free and ecological society. Specifically, the thesis, using participatory research approaches, focuses on the role of urban social movements in addressing the urban crises which acutely affect Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where intense social mobilizations emerged in 2013-2014. It examines the complex understanding of urban crises by urban social movements, and their tactics and organizational strategies, tracing points of contact between urban social movement practices and the social ecology perspective.

This movement has been argued to represent a ‘new type of politics’ with an unprecedented ideological and organisational character based on new fragmented power relationships that have undermined traditional class and national relationships and consequently have undermined the relevance of classical socialist theory. In place of nation state-based socialist strategies for delivering social justice, the GMSJ has been established on the principles of autonomy and an absence of representative structures of any kind. Often, these movements are described as (transnational) New Social Movements. This thesis challenges these concepts and argues they fall within a post-socialist orthodox approach to social science. It compares socialist concepts relating to power, class, nations and political organisation with post-socialist concepts, and in so doing, argues that post-socialist ideas have gained an orthodox status in a period when Stalinist models of (national) state planning have collapsed and social democratic parties have capitulated to the demands of globalised neo-liberal capitalism. Under such conditions, it has been possible for post-socialist theory to reflect observed failures of socialist movements and the thesis argues that underlying post-socialist theories of power, globalisation and a fragmentation of material power relations are often excessively abstract and unconvincing. These arguments are developed through the presentation of research into GMSJ activist organisations, part of the movements that affiliated to the London round of the ESF in 2004. In presenting analysis of in-depth interviews with participants and key organizational leaders, the thesis examines how the contemporary GMSJ remains sceptical that class based socialist theory can mobilise contemporary mass movements. However, it also develops a better understanding of how activists in this new global social movement reflect socialist theories relating to power, property relations and class in their conceptualisation of patterns of social injustice. Overall, the research suggests post-socialist theories have failed to provide a programme or strategy for building a mass movement for social justice. It argues that, contrary to often stated claims about its Marxist foundations, post-socialist ideology has not been able to outline the systemic foundations for another world. However, the research suggests that the central concepts of Marxist theory relating to power, property relations, class and political organisation nevertheless remain relevant to the GMSJ and that democratic socialist planning is the only coherent systemic alternative to capitalism that has been placed before the GMSJ. The thesis will argue that the GMSJ could help to develop an ideological alternative to global capitalism by engaging with a rich history of socialist theory.",1827523178,,Dissertations & Theses," Wood, JaredWoodJaredWood, Jared",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209477001 , 105317482 , 101309 , 10173313 , 10173313 , http://bbktheses.da.ulcc.ac.uk/184/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827523178?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://bbktheses.da.ulcc.ac.uk/184/ , (UMI)AAI10173313 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+defence+of+marxism%3A+marxist+theories+of+globalisation+and+social+injustice+and+the+evolution+of+post-socialist+ideology+within+contemporary+movements+for+global+social+justice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wood%2C+Jared&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"849,"Low emissions, high concern: How climate communicators grapple with a transnational issue in the Philippines","Climate change is one of the most pressing scientific and social issues of the 21 st century. Communication about climate change has been the subject of intense interest by social scientists for the last two decades. However, the vast majority of scholarly studies about climate communication have focused on the wealthy nations that are major carbon polluters. Little is known about how climate change is communicated in the poorer nations that produce few emissions and are the first to experience the effects of climate change. This study addresses that gap in scholarship by focusing on climate communication in the Philippines, a developing nation where climate change has been on the national agenda since increasingly devastating typhoons struck the country in the last five years. The study uses a mixed-methods design that includes semi-structured interviews and a quantitative social media analysis. Climate activists and journalists were interviewed in Manila to understand three aspects of climate communication in the developing world: journalists’ climate reporting, and activists’ social movement frame-building as well as social media strategies. A quantitative analysis of social media strategies was conducted on activist messages on Twitter targeting the U.N. climate negotiations in Paris in December 2015. This mixed-methods study of three aspects of climate communication in the developing world is informed by theories from mass communication and social movement scholarship. In particular, the study is concerned with public sphere theory and its applicability to a transnational issue – climate change – and the advent of borderless digital media systems. In general, the study finds that climate communicators in the developing world continue to be disempowered in the global debate about emissions despite the rise of global forms of journalism and open-access digital media networks. Climate journalism is still nascent and reporters struggle to connect local effects of climate change to the global issue due to organizational and cultural constraints. Activists are better-positioned to engage with climate on a transnational scale; they do this through the climate justice frame and in their social media strategies. However, developing nation voices still struggle to be heard as they compete with a multitude of other actors even in the supposedly democratic networked media space.",1828128668,,Dissertations & Theses," Evans, SuzannahEvansSuzannahEvans, Suzannah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4212452991 , 106569342 , 66569 , 9781369013290 , 10145899 , 10145899", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369013290, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828128668?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0404 Climate Change , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0404 Climate Change , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0404 Climate Change , 0708 Mass communications",," 0391 Journalism , 0404 Climate Change , 0708 Mass communications"," Journalism , Climate Change , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Earth sciences , Climate change advocacy , Climate journalism , Mixed methods , Philippines , Social media , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Low+emissions%2C+high+concern%3A+How+climate+communicators+grapple+with+a+transnational+issue+in+the+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Evans%2C+Suzannah&amp;isbn=9781369013290&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"850,"Youth…Power…Egypt: The Development of Youth as a Sociopolitical Concept and Force in Egypt, 1805-1923","This study focuses on youth as a symbol, metaphor, and subject involved in processes related to Egypt’s modernization, colonization, and liberation from the beginning of the nineteenth century through the 1919 Egyptian Revolution. It demonstrates that youth was not simply an unchanging stage of development between childhood and adulthood, but a construct reflecting the political, social, and cultural interests of specific eras and perspectives. I critically analyze the local and global discourses on Egypt’s modernization, colonialism, and nationalist movement to understand how changing power relations within and outside the country affected conceptions of youth and youthfulness. Additionally, I suggest by the time of the 1919 Revolution, representations of an ideal youth transferred into a real political and social force. This dissertation argues that the transformation of self-identity, embodied in a growing pride in the youthful spirit of a deep-rooted, old civilization helped drive Egypt’s modern “awakening.” While this project focuses its attention specifically on Egypt, I situate all these developments within a global context in order to showcase the paradoxical connections of youth culture formation between the colonized and colonizer, as well as between generations within this era of modernization and dramatic social transformation.",1828341816,,Dissertations & Theses," Parnell, Matthew B.ParnellB.MatthewParnell, Matthew B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4213789621 , 108373972 , 66569 , 9781369015201 , 10146091 , 10146091", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369015201, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828341816?accountid=14496," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0560 North African Studies , 0578 History"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0560 North African Studies , 0578 History"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0560 North African Studies , 0578 History",," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0560 North African Studies , 0578 History"," Middle Eastern Studies , North African Studies , History"," Social sciences , Egypt , Egyptian Revolution , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Youth%E2%80%A6Power%E2%80%A6Egypt%3A+The+Development+of+Youth+as+a+Sociopolitical+Concept+and+Force+in+Egypt%2C+1805-1923&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Parnell%2C+Matthew+B.&amp;isbn=9781369015201&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"851,"""Lost my Job, Found an Occupation:"" Space, Networks, and Organization in Occupy Wall Street","While scholars have separately analyzed the role of both networks and space in social movements, little attention has been drawn to their relationship. This dissertation draws from in-depth qualitative research on the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement in New York City in order to provide an insight into this relationship. The findings discussed in the dissertation suggest, in particular, that social movements’ internal networks and various uses of space have a mutually constitutive and interactive relationship—that different uses of space create, reflect, and reproduce social movement networks. The findings of the research are presented in three substantive chapters. The first set of findings introduces the connection between social movement networks and uses of space by highlighting how the Occupy Wall Street movement’s sustained occupation of Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan carried out four organizational functions: messaging, recruitment, building commitment, and connecting participants to each other. The findings discussed in the following chapter additionally illustrate this connection by showing how the Occupy Wall Street movement’s decentralized structure and tactic of occupation served as mutually beneficial elements of a distinctive global repertoire. The final substantive chapter then discusses two factors that contributed to the engagement of OWS participants—a perceived ability to contribute to or shape the direction of a movement, and dense ties among participants—and in particular highlights the role of the occupation in strengthening the movement’s internal networks. Together, these findings illustrate the interactive and mutually constitutive relationship between social movement networks and uses of space. Ultimately, both social movement scholars and practitioners stand to benefit from a more sophisticated understanding of the specific ways in which social movements’ internal networks and uses of space affect one another.",1828415519,,Dissertations & Theses," Savio, GianmarcoSavioGianmarcoSavio, Gianmarco",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4213889081 , 106119232 , 66569 , 9781369168143 , 10161952 , 10161952", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369168143, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828415519?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0635 Organization Theory"," 0626 Sociology , 0635 Organization Theory"," 0626 Sociology , 0635 Organization Theory",," 0626 Sociology , 0635 Organization Theory"," Sociology , Organization Theory"," Social sciences , Networks , Occupation , Organization , Social movements , Space",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Lost+my+Job%2C+Found+an+Occupation%3A%22+Space%2C+Networks%2C+and+Organization+in+Occupy+Wall+Street&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Savio%2C+Gianmarco&amp;isbn=9781369168143&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"852,"""We're Going Too!"" The Children of the Birmingham Civil Rights Movement","In 1963, the Birmingham, Alabama civil rights movement brought both national and international attention to the plight of southern African Americans. The Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR), in partnership with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), utilized nonviolent direct action, marches, sit- ins, jail-ins, and boycotts- to challenge Birmingham discriminatory laws and practices. The success of the Birmingham campaign was due in large part to the participation and personal sacrifice of black schoolchildren. This dissertation examines the local Birmingham movement from the perspective of its most indispensible participants, black youth. It explores what it meant to be a black child coming of age under Jim Crow. It analyzes the recruitment, participation, and impact of Birmingham black youth in the Children March, a weeklong protest from May 2 to May 7, 1963, during which over 2,000 children between ages six and eighteen marched through Birmingham streets in nonviolent protest against racial inequality. It also looks anew at the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church on September 15, 1963, which led to the deaths of four black school-aged girls, and the subsequent killing of two black boys. Studying these events offers fresh insight into the lived experiences of black youth under Jim Crow, and the national and international media attention that these events garnered, which helped compel the federal government to support new civil rights legislation. Despite the invaluable contributions of children to the Birmingham movement, their personal stories and contributions remain largely overlooked. The marginalization of black youth is attributable in part to the usual approach to studying the civil rights movement. Over the past four decades, the conventional narrative of the civil rights movement has expanded as it relates to gender, class, space, and time, but much less in terms of age. To more fully incorporate age as a prism through which to better understand the civil rights movement, this project draws on primary and secondary sources related to black children growing up in the era of Jim Crow, as well as oral histories chronicling the experiences of African Americans leading up to and during the height of the civil rights movement. We Are Going Too! The Children of the Birmingham Civil Rights Movement asks: what did it mean to come of age as an African American child in Birmingham, Alabama at the height of the civil rights movement? In order to answer this question effectively, this dissertation investigates the lived conditions, family dynamics, and the long lasting socio-economic impact of Jim Crow on black children in the American South. Set against a backdrop of Cold War domestic race politics, this dissertation examines the history of black childhood during the Jim Crow era as a way to better understand how black boys and girls came to be active participants in the most important social movement of the twentieth century. It draws heavily on oral histories of men and women who grew up in Birmingham in the civil rights era, which shines much needed light on how black people experienced racial discrimination, including racial violence, and social protest. The narratives of their experiences and observations provide a unique perspective on black childhood as it relates to the civil rights movement, both locally and nationally. This research will contribute significantly to an already rich collection of scholarship on the modern civil rights movement by creating a fuller, more complete picture of black life during the Jim Crow era and the struggle for freedom during the civil rights era.",1828874636,,Dissertations & Theses," Jeter-Bennett, GisellJeter-BennettGisellJeter-Bennett, Gisell",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4214800901 , 108393672 , 66569 , 9781369006032 , 10145044 , 10145044", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369006032, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828874636?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Alabama , Black schoolchildren , Civil rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22We%27re+Going+Too%21%22+The+Children+of+the+Birmingham+Civil+Rights+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jeter-Bennett%2C+Gisell&amp;isbn=9781369006032&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"853,"Contracting Freedom: Race, Empire, and U.S. Labor Importation Programs, 1942-1964","This dissertation reviews the historical interpretations of “guestworkers” that emerged with the creation of the labor importation agreements between the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean during and after World War II, to expose “guestworker” programs as a pivotal axis in the U.S. imperial framework of the twentieth century. Cast as facilitating individual salvation and international reciprocity, U.S. migrant labor importation policies with Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, Honduras, Barbados, and Puerto Rico emphasized the labor contract, bilateral agreements between nation-states, and equal rights, all of which appeared as advances from older labor arrangements forged under colonialism and slavery. Through various debates between and among U.S. government officials, leftist labor leaders, civil rights activists, and agribusiness employers, this dissertation examines how they all, in contradictory ways, celebrated and projected these labor programs as marking a new global age of freedom. This emergent rhetoric of freedom surrounding labor migrations to the United States facilitated, obscured, legitimated, and extended global racial and colonial dynamics in the post-World War II era. To expose how empire and race drove the programs, each chapter places the labor programs within the context of their formative moments: U.S imperial interventions in Latin America in the nineteenth century, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, slavery and indentured servitude in the British Caribbean colonies, the U.S. labor and civil rights movements, and the movements for independence in the British West Indies. In viewing the co-constitutive logic of “guestworker” labor programs within these formative contexts, it reveals that the “break” from empire that the labor programs seemed to signify in the 1940s was hardly a break at all. It then addresses how “guestworkers” and their advocates struggled to compel the state to fulfill the “freedom” of the labor programs during the long civil rights movement. Within the daily struggles of migrant workers and anticolonial activists, we can begin to find glimpses of wider visions of social justice that challenged the mandates of the U.S. liberal state, beyond universal “freedom” as it is framed by “rights” under nation. “Contracting Freedom” demonstrates that the racial formation of the U.S. “guestworker” was much more than a minor footnote to U.S. race relations, usually assumed to matter only along the West Coast with the advent of the Bracero Program. Instead, the “guestworker” proved central to the reconstruction of race, class, and nation during the mid-twentieth century, by upsetting and then recreating social and cultural dualisms that lay at the heart of American identities and imperial subjectivities: foreign and domestic, freedom and slavery, citizen and noncitizen, guest and alien.",1830451587,,Dissertations & Theses," Quintana, MariaQuintanaMariaQuintana, Maria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4218698621 , 108486742 , 66569 , 9781369169867 , 10162186 , 10162186", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369169867, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830451587?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0501 Economics , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0501 Economics , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0501 Economics , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0501 Economics , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , American history , Economics , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Contracting , Empire , Freedom , Importation , Labor , Race , U.S",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contracting+Freedom%3A+Race%2C+Empire%2C+and+U.S.+Labor+Importation+Programs%2C+1942-1964&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Quintana%2C+Maria&amp;isbn=9781369169867&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"854,Not Your Business: Pedagogical Lessons of Activist Resistance to Neoliberalism in Canadian Higher Education,"The growing power and permeation of neoliberal ideology across all facets of social life has been instrumental in promoting and orchestrating a shift among Canadian post-secondary institutions towards a reductive view of schooling at the expense of a more liberatory vision of education. The aim of this study was to examine the connections between power, education, and democracy in relation to the neoliberal restructuring of higher education in Canada, while simultaneously exploring discourses of resistance to neoliberal hegemony. Using critical discourse analysis, this study begins by establishing the promotion and naturalization of neoliberal ideology within the policy landscape of Canadian higher education via four discursive manifestations: the reduction of education to a market function by emphasizing job training and curricular compatibility with labor market needs; the construction of students as economic entities or customers who are in the business of purchasing an education for their own personal, material gain; the commercialization of knowledge and research achieved via the establishment of formal linkages between post-secondary education and the private sector; and the trend to compensate for decreased public funding for post-secondary education by promoting “internationalization” which positions international students as a source of revenue generation and human capital. This study then documented the successes, challenges, and teachings of the largest and most recent student-led, grassroots-based movement in Canadian history--the Maple Spring of 2012--which launched a powerful counter-story to the prevailing doctrine of neoliberalism in Canadian educational and social policy. In unprecedented collective action--and despite vilification by the state and media who variably pathologized student protesters as disengaged and lazy or violent and extreme--students used a local policy proposal to illuminate a global ideological shift threatening to transform and obliterate public spaces and services, while interrupting the dominant neoliberal discourse. By presenting a vision for education as a form of cultural politics and vehicle for social justice, this student movement defended institutions of higher education as public resources that serve the common good as opposed to profit-driven entities subservient to the market economy. Considered together, the findings from this study aim to contribute to the ongoing conversation regarding the role of higher education in democratic life and the link, however fractured and tenuous it currently may be, between activism and social policy.",1830773384,,Dissertations & Theses," Thordarson, Jorunn V.ThordarsonV.JorunnThordarson, Jorunn V.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4222730981 , 105815662 , 66569 , 9781369183351 , 10163644 , 10163644", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369183351, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830773384?accountid=14496, 0340 Educational sociology, 0340 Educational sociology, 0340 Educational sociology,, 0340 Educational sociology, Educational sociology," Education , Activist , Business , Lessons , Neoliberalism , Pedagogical , Resistance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Not+Your+Business%3A+Pedagogical+Lessons+of+Activist+Resistance+to+Neoliberalism+in+Canadian+Higher+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thordarson%2C+Jorunn+V.&amp;isbn=9781369183351&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"855,"Media of Resistance: A Communication History of the Communist Movement in the Dutch East Indies, 1920-1926","This dissertation is a communication history of the early communist anti-colonial movement in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in 1920-1926. While for three centuries struggles against Dutch imperialism had been sporadic, local, and traditional in character, in this period people organized themselves for the first time in a radical, national, and global revolutionary movement. Rather than resort to weapons and warfare, the resistance movement developed collective actions around new emerging communicative technologies and practices—“media of resistance”—that included schools, public debates, popular journalism, arts, and literature. The dissertation examines the processes by which ordinary people produced these media of resistance as a new way of organizing and mobilizing. The aim is twofold: first, to reveal the centrality of communicative sociotechnical systems (practices, processes, and technologies) in the emergence, development, success, and demise of a social movement; and, second, to highlight the roles of ordinary people in that process, a focus hidden in the previous historiography due to leader-, party-, and formal event-centered narratives. I utilize underexplored concepts of mobility and sociability to analyze shipping and railway lines, openbare vergaderingen (public meetings), People’s Schools, the revolutionary newspaper Sinar Hindia, as well as government legal interventions into these communicative practices. This research suggests two main findings. First, while the aforementioned media of communication were intended to expand colonial power, the ordinary people in the movement creatively repurposed and brought them together to become the “media of resistance,” revealing the centrality of media of communication in the making of a social movement. These creative repurposing practices point to the nature of communicative sociotechnical systems as projects and sites of struggle. Second, through historical GIS method, I also find that the movement was mobilized for the first time across widespread geographical areas, as well as across different cultural borders and identity markers. This widespread solidarity gave voice to anti-colonial sentiments, Islamic modernism, national liberation, women’s emancipation, and human rights, appealing to universal concerns. The dissertation concludes by arguing for the broader significance of this research for global media studies, its treatment of non-western experiences, and studies of enlightenment and social movements.",1834498698,,Dissertations & Theses," Subijanto, Rianne KartikasariSubijantoKartikasariRianneSubijanto, Rianne Kartikasari",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4235117141 , 105132982 , 66569 , 9781369057881 , 10151024 , 10151024", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369057881, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1834498698?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0459 Communication"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0459 Communication"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0459 Communication",," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0459 Communication"," History , Asian Studies , Communication"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Communism , Critical theory , Global media studies , Indonesia , Social movements , Technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Media+of+Resistance%3A+A+Communication+History+of+the+Communist+Movement+in+the+Dutch+East+Indies%2C+1920-1926&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Subijanto%2C+Rianne+Kartikasari&amp;isbn=9781369057881&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"856,"Seeking ekobio: Cultural exchange and the African diasporic imagination of the Americas, 1940-2000","This dissertation traces twentieth-century cultural and intellectual exchange within black consciousness movements of the US and Latin America through the lives of influential activists, artists, and authors who built transnational networks of support and collaboration. I argue that these networks fostered the construction of a distinct African diasporic imagination of the Americas. This imagination projected an alternative and necessary space where African descendants (and it was eventually argued all Americans) could re-engage with and rewrite historical memory. Within this space African heritage was celebrated for its inherent value and deep and rich contribution to the hemisphere in all areas: culturally, politically, socially, and economically. From this imagined familial diasporic space, the tensions between difference and commonality were reconciled for greater purpose. The family of ekobio, who collectively addressed the pain of the past, became a source from which many could draw the great resilience that allowed the fight against racism and toward social justice to continue in so many spheres and throughout the adult lives of the activists and artists discussed here. This imagination was composed of several unique factors. It differed from, yet was in conversation with, movements such as Pan-Africanism and international anti-colonial movements. The continent(s) of the Americas was an essential geographic, spiritual, and conceptual framework within which this understanding of the diasporic experience was situated, and while Pan-Americanism existed long before the twentieth century, certain postwar historical moments created shifts and changes in the diasporic imagination in innovative ways between 1940 and 2000.

A number of them faced human rights abuses such as deportation back to Tunisia, suffered violence and oppression at the hands of the Italian police and Italian society at large, and were stigmatized as “potential criminals” and “hidden terrorists” by both state and non-state actors, i.e., employers, media and the larger public. Using narratives and oral histories from the study population, this research explores 1) the processes of criminalizing and dehumanizing the migrant “Other” such that violence perpetrated against him is permitted and rationalized; 2) the irregular migrants’ experience, discussion, negotiation of, and resistance to, their socially constructed “illegality” and “criminality”; and 3) the trends in anti-migrant violence and oppression and their consequences for the migrants’ identities, survival strategies, and daily struggles. Transnational migration scholarship and its idea of the “permeability” of national “borders” as shifting political spaces provided a theoretical foundation for this multi-sited research. The project transcends geographical boundaries to reach a macro-level understanding of the study population and to demonstrate the processes through which transnational movements are produced, forged, and maintained. The relevance of this research cannot be overstated as political turmoil in the Middle East continues, and irregular migrants and refugees pour into Europe. Thus, although the number of Tunisian migrants to Italy has significantly dropped since the 2011 uprising, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been landing on Italian southern shores since 2015 when Syria entered into a civil war.",1836766367,,Dissertations & Theses," Khedher, RayedKhedherRayedKhedher, Rayed",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4241205941 , 105866142 , 66569 , 9781369305388 , 10182128 , 10182128", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369305388, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1836766367?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Irregular migration , Islamophobia , Italy , Popular uprising , Tunisia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Dreams+to+Deportations%3A+The+Case+of+Tunisian+Irregular+Migrants+in+Italy+After+2011&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khedher%2C+Rayed&amp;isbn=9781369305388&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"858,"Social mobility and aspirations: young colombians in cartagena: navigating opportunities, spaces and futures","The role of young people’s aspirations to achieve upward social mobility, social mobility being defined as people’s upward or downward movement in relation to others within the same society with respect to status or social class (Gough, 2008, Azevedo and Bouiilon, 2010), has been of increasing interest in international development. Especially for young people of disadvantaged social backgrounds, high aspirations are perceived as the main driver for future enhanced social conditions (Appadurai, 2004). With a particular focus on educational and occupational aspirations, young people are encouraged to aim for higher education and higher occupational outcomes to achieve upward social mobility (Kintrea et al., 2015). However this discourse shifts the responsibility of achieving upward social mobility and for being successful adults in the future, on to young people themselves, promoting social mobility as an individualised obligation (Brown, 2011, Spohrer, 2011). Yet social mobility and corresponding aspirations are not attained independently of young people’s social context. In order to enhance their social mobility they need to acquire the necessary social and cultural capitals and have access to adequate opportunities within their social and physical environment to navigate themselves towards their aspirations. Informed by ethnographic and participatory fieldwork, this thesis explores young Colombians’ (age 15-22) aspirations for social mobility in Cartagena and adds to the critique of the increasingly powerful discourse about the need to enhance disadvantaged young people’s aspirations in order to achieve upward social mobility (cf. Kintrea et al., 2015). Cartagena is described as a city of many realities, made up of ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ neighbourhoods, offering unequal opportunities to its residents. This stratification is one legacy of a long history of slavery and colonialism. I present young Cartagenians’ aspirations and what they perceive as drivers and constraints of social mobility. Drawing upon the concepts of habitus, and social and cultural capital, I analyse the importance of how young Cartagenians’ sense of belonging to poorer neighbourhoods influences their opportunities to achieve upward social mobility. This research contributes to the knowledge of young people’s attempts to formulate aspirations and navigate their way towards these within a post-colonial setting in the global South from a qualitative research II perspective. It explores the intersecting relationships between aspirations, belonging, spatial and social mobility, and opportunity structures accessible to young Cartageneros.",1837035424,,Dissertations & Theses," Marzi, SonjaMarziSonjaMarzi, Sonja",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4242268181 , 106702882 , 101309 , 10293205 , 10293205 , https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/59462/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837035424?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/59462/ , (UMI)AAI10293205 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+mobility+and+aspirations%3A+young+colombians+in+cartagena%3A+navigating+opportunities%2C+spaces+and+futures&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marzi%2C+Sonja&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"859,Corporate social responsibility policies and labour practices in ghana: a case study of anglogold ashanti and the international framework agreement,"This case study was on one of the major areas in industrial relations (IR), union-employer relations. Specifically it dealt with the global mining giant, AngloGold Ashanti, the only mining signatory to an International Framework Agreement (IFA) in Africa. The study also examined the management practices transfer, the two IFA/GFA agreements (2002 and 2009) and the company’s corporate code of conduct (CCC) and its CSR practices. The methodology for this study was qualitative through the interpretive method, entailing desk research, internet searches and interviews of 46 persons among select mining stakeholder groups. There were national and local unions, AngloGold staff, government agencies, academics/researchers, other professionals and NGOs. The results showed that there was little or no awareness/knowledge of IFAs, AngloGold as an IFA signatory, her CCC, management practices transfer, unions and global union federations (GUF). The respondents were however aware of the company’s corporate philanthropy projects. The findings also revealed that the power of the unions has not been able to match up to the powers of AngloGold in all respects. Whatever “meaning” there was, had been socially constructed by AngloGold in their activities and CSR, their recourse to a management initiated CCC, rather than their two global agreements. The Ghana unions were more of the “pluralist” tradition, within a “neo-institutionalist” type of worker representation as opposed to their South African counterparts who were “radical” and “militant” within the “social movement” stock. The Ghana unions were spineless despite the successes achieved in other jurisdictions and continents, in “union coalition”, “transnational solidarity”, “social movement unionism”, and “community unions”. The unions should also strive to reconstruct the AngloGold determined “meanings”. These unions with the assistance of sister unions and GUFs need to counter the management practices in union-employer relations like outsourcing, discrimination in remuneration and the poor corporate governance practices of AngloGold.",1837040095,,Dissertations & Theses," Rockson, KwekuRocksonKwekuRockson, Kweku",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4242263481 , 103854232 , 101309 , 10292831 , 10292831 , http://hdl.handle.net/2381/37785", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837040095?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/2381/37785 , (UMI)AAI10292831 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Corporate+social+responsibility+policies+and+labour+practices+in+ghana%3A+a+case+study+of+anglogold+ashanti+and+the+international+framework+agreement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rockson%2C+Kweku&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"860,"""Wolves guarding sheep"": How women police in London and Cape Town brokered a deal to protect and control women, 1914-1918","At the outbreak of World War I, women in Britain and South Africa formed groups of volunteer police women who patrolled the streets for indecent behavior, found homes for runaway children, and encouraged moral behavior of young women and girls. Despite their success at penetrating one of the most male-dominated professions, historians almost unanimously regard the movement as a betrayal of feminist values and goals. A careful reading of contemporary sources, however, reveals that the women police were attempting to work within the system to better the lives of females. With the movement headed by social purity feminists, a group now largely decried as antifeminist for their conservative and protectionist agendas, the approach was rather to protect women from the full impact of sexist laws, as opposed to actually changing those laws. These women saw the prevention of immoral behavior as not simply an imposition of conservative middle class values, but an expedient measure to protect females from a justice system whose very structure was designed to find them guilty. Feminists tend to discount social purists’ impact on the modern feminist movement, but the transnational presence of the women police, as shown by this thesis’ study of the Cape Town group, reminds scholars that the feminist movement has always been riddled with ambivalence and dilemmas. This thesis demonstrates that the social purity movement was a force to be reckoned with, and succeeded where suffragists had failed in opening the door to women in law enforcement.",1839283815,,Dissertations & Theses," Laird, KatieLairdKatieLaird, Katie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4249716981 , 109062722 , 66569 , 9781369136012 , 10158593 , 10158593", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369136012, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1839283815?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies"," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies"," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies",," 0335 European history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies"," European history , Law , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Britain , Police , Policewomen , Social purists , Suffrage , Women police , Women's movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Wolves+guarding+sheep%22%3A+How+women+police+in+London+and+Cape+Town+brokered+a+deal+to+protect+and+control+women%2C+1914-1918&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Laird%2C+Katie&amp;isbn=9781369136012&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"861,"St. Luke’s College of Nursing, Tokyo, Japan: The intersections of an Episcopal Church mission project, Rockefeller Foundation philanthropy, and the development of nursing in Japan, 1918-1941.","The leadership at St. Luke’s International Hospital and its nurse training program were very vocal about being a state of the art medical facility that sought through its nurse training program to raise the quality of nursing education and practice in Japan. They very clearly sought to reproduce American styled nursing education at St. Luke’s. To achieve this they brought nurses from the United States to teach and manage the nurse training program and brought Japanese nurses from Japan to the United States for post graduate studies and observation experiences. This study examines the tensions that exist at the intersections of a foreign Episcopal Church mission project, Rockefeller Foundation philanthropy, and the development of nursing in Japan. This study uses historical methodology and is a transnational study. A theory of Critical Transnational Feminism (CTF) is used to consider issues of race, class, and gender at St. Luke’s International Hospital and School of Nursing in Tokyo, Japan in the early twentieth century. The collaboration between Japanese nurses, physicians, and board members with American missionary nurses and doctors to lead and develop a world class medical center and school of nursing provides an opportunity to probe issues of power based on gender, race, and class. The CTF lens calls attention to the tendency of transnational history to often be Western-centric and has provided a framework to go deeper into an equitable representation of transnational studies. This study has found that lay medical missionaries prioritized their professional goals over the Christianizing goals of the church. The study reveals that power in the transnational space was a shifting and contested quality. Although Japanese and American actors at St. Luke’s talked about cultural diplomacy the relationships that they had were still hierarchical across race, gender and professional boundaries. Nursing at St. Luke’s represented progressive professionalization movements for women for both Japanese and American nurses. Nurses who traveled had elite social opportunities because of the associations that they had in their international work. Finally, St. Luke’s was uniquely positioned to develop public health nursing in Japan and they had significant impact in that area.",1840802768,,Dissertations & Theses," Nishida, Kathleen M.NishidaM.KathleenNishida, Kathleen M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4252565661 , 105804432 , 66569 , 9781369340334 , 10191916 , 10191916", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369340334, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1840802768?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0569 Nursing"," 0332 History , 0569 Nursing"," 0332 History , 0569 Nursing",," 0332 History , 0569 Nursing"," History , Nursing"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Diplomacy , Gender studies , Japan , Missionaries , Rockefeller Foundation , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=St.+Luke%E2%80%99s+College+of+Nursing%2C+Tokyo%2C+Japan%3A+The+intersections+of+an+Episcopal+Church+mission+project%2C+Rockefeller+Foundation+philanthropy%2C+and+the+development+of+nursing+in+Japan%2C+1918-1941.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nishida%2C+Kathleen+M.&amp;isbn=9781369340334&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"862,Unmaking Identity: Male-to-Female Transgenderism in Southwest China,"China has long been regarded as an authoritarian Party-state where economic growth has been accompanied by stringent control of civil society, including LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) human rights. Intriguingly, in my field research in the southwestern city of Kunming from November 2011 to July 2013, a thriving business of transgendered sex work and performance coexisted with transgendered individuals’ non-recognition of and/or nonchalance towards a transgender identity. My dissertation thus looks into the space of (un)becoming with regard to the constitution of a Chinese transgender identity and community from the perspective of a diverse array of social processes in mainland China, including international and national HIV/AIDS intervention projects, the emergence of transnational LGBT identity-based human rights movements, the neoliberal turn to cultural economy that embraces desires, and the trajectory that state-individual relationships have gone through. I argue that the indifference (or non-recognition) I discerned from many of my transgendered informants with regard to their gender/sexual identities is contingent upon an assemblage of social processes that have given rise to the confusing and even contradictory condition of life with which transgendered individuals have struggled. Through traversing the different domains of life where transgendered practices appear and are submerged, I aim to achieve two conceptual goals. First, rather than present the constitution of a transgender identity in China, my project demonstrates the dispersion of it via ongoing ethnographic encounters that constantly sidestep, if not disregard, seemingly apparent practices of transgenderism. This problematization of identity as a valid analytic category leads to the second conceptual goal of my dissertation, i.e. the use of queer perspective that can better capture the ways in which lived experience overflows analytic categories. While queer studies have made as almost paradigmatic the analytic and political commitment to antinormativity (or typically anti-heteronormativity), my ethnographic encounters suggest that queerness can be more fruitfully deployed to problematize heteronormativity from within rather than carve out an alternative space to it. Theorizing through ethnography, this project brings into conversation cross-disciplinary concerns that include international public health intervention, neoliberal globalization, China studies, and feminist and queer studies.",1841897114,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, ShunyuanZhangShunyuanZhang, Shunyuan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4256968381 , 108835682 , 66569 , 9781369299502 , 10181336 , 10181336", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369299502, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1841897114?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , GLBT Studies"," Social sciences , China studies , Identity , Queer anthropology , Transgendered practices",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unmaking+Identity%3A+Male-to-Female+Transgenderism+in+Southwest+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Shunyuan&amp;isbn=9781369299502&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"863,"He was a camera: Christopher Isherwood, Weimar Germany, and transationalism in the American gay rights movement","Christopher Isherwood was a novelist perhaps best known in America for writing the stories later immortalized in the Broadway musical Cabaret. He lived in Germany during the Weimar Republic (1919-33) and drew upon his experiences in the gay community to write the “Berlin Stories” and others depicting homosexual culture in Berlin. Germany after WWI saw a liberalizing period of social freedom, including relaxed sexual norms that allowed the homosexual community to “come out” from the invisible underground. It is that community with which Isherwood interacted and experienced ideas he brought out of Germany. Coming to America in 1939, Isherwood existed as a transnational figure within the American gay rights movement, who aided the homosexual cause by incorporating his Berlin experiences into novels dealing openly with homosexuality as early as the 1930s and 40s. It was the freedom of his Weimar experience that led Isherwood to carve out his identity both as “an outsider minority” within the dominant heterosexual society, and as an activist openly declaring and discussing his homosexuality as a public figure. Isherwood’s United States was a society dominated by heterosexual culture norms, and he rebelled against it. He perpetuated his Weimar identification with an “outsider minority” that should exist in peace within a dominant heterosexual society, used his writing as a boost to the homosexual rights movement to help create a gay literature base, and became a transnational bridge between the permissive culture of Weimar Germany and the United States in the 1960s and 70s.",1841911962,,Dissertations & Theses," Nelson, Kristof R.NelsonR.KristofNelson, Kristof R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4257037231 , 106446452 , 66569 , 9781369151213 , 10160213 , 10160213", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369151213, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1841911962?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," American history , GLBT Studies , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Civil rights , Gay literature , Gay rights movement , Germany , Isherwood, Christopher",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=He+was+a+camera%3A+Christopher+Isherwood%2C+Weimar+Germany%2C+and+transationalism+in+the+American+gay+rights+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nelson%2C+Kristof+R.&amp;isbn=9781369151213&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"864,Emerging Infectious Diseases: Sierra Leone's 2014 Ebola as a Case Study of Modern-Day Epidemic Plagues,"As the world entered the twenty-first century, many nation states were engulfed in economic and political crises, losing sight of the emerging threats of infectious diseases that were tearing societies apart and creating new forms of global insecurities. These emerging plagues challenge not just individual nations but also global public health, and deplete the productive population that might be best equipped to champion economic, political, and social development of countries in Africa. Sierra Leone is just one example of a country that is burdened by poverty and disease, as its citizens grapple with malaria, cholera, tuberculosis, typhoid, yellow fever, Lassa fever, and recently Ebola. The 2014 Ebola crisis is unprecedented in its challenge to the country's ailing healthcare system and struggling economy both of which require urgent attention. The research examines the epidemiological basis of infectious disease outbreaks in Sierra Leone, and the role of globalization and socio-cultural factors in the occurrence, spread, and impact of the 2014 plague. Specifically, the study looks at (1) the theoretical foundation of disease outbreak, origin, and rapid spread in the epidemiological tradition; (2) the connectedness of the 2014 Ebola outbreak and spread to the process of globalization and socio-cultural variables; (3) the responses of major factors in combating the disease; and (4) the way forward in addressing the question: ""What went wrong""? The methodology employed is based on the mixed-method research design that involves the use of both quantitative and qualitative approaches in integrating facts, figures, and ideas in the study. The data was analyzed using the software package NVivo for qualitative data and the t test for quantitative data. The findings show that the movement of people, local and global politics, societal factors, systemic and institutional failures in public health delivery, and NGO involvement impacted Sierra Leone’s 2014 Ebola outbreak in diverse ways. The data from communities, public servants, NGOs, and official documents all show that Sierra Leone’s weak political and societal structures prior to and after the country’s 11-year-old civil war, which took place in the 1990s, played a major role in weakening its public health system. The ravages of war left the country incapable of responding to the outbreak in a timely manner. The study unveiled that the legacies of war and displacement, aspects of globalization, and the policy responses of a detached international system at sub-regional, regional, and global levels, all combined in creating the difficulties that impeded the timely response to the 2014 Ebola crisis. The conclusion is that modern-day plagues like Sierra Leone’s 2014 Ebola crisis transcend national boundaries into the global arena due to increase globalization; and that the advent and spread of these infectious diseases are due to an interaction of biological, economic, social, political, and environmental causes. The findings and conclusion support the recommendation that Sierra Leone’s post-Ebola public health strategy must focus on improving: (1) the country’s health resource status; (2) the state of its health institutions, educational system, information infrastructure; and (3) its overall development and public health level. It is recommended that the governance challenges impeding effective coordination, partnership, and synergy among local and international stakeholders in Sierra Leone’s public health delivery must be addressed by appropriate policy responses. Finally, the recommendations call for Sierra Leone’s public health policies to be situated in the country's overall development and contextualized in local needs. The results of this study can inform policymakers, partners, scholars, civic organizations, and communities, and the recommendations offer viable courses of action that would lead to better responses in confronting future disease outbreak and spread.",1842428728,,Dissertations & Theses," Max-Kyne, Sao-Kpato Hannah IsattaMax-KyneHannah IsattaSao-KpatoMax-Kyne, Sao-Kpato Hannah Isatta",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4258897111 , 109216142 , 66569 , 9781369156423 , 10160737 , 10160737", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369156423, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1842428728?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy"," 0293 African Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy"," 0293 African Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy",," 0293 African Studies , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy"," African Studies , Public health , Public policy"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Ebola , Poverty reduction , Sierra Leone , Social research , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emerging+Infectious+Diseases%3A+Sierra+Leone%27s+2014+Ebola+as+a+Case+Study+of+Modern-Day+Epidemic+Plagues&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Max-Kyne%2C+Sao-Kpato+Hannah+Isatta&amp;isbn=9781369156423&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"865,From fish schools to primate societies: The dynamics of collective movement in animal groups,"Animals that live in groups face a dual challenge of effectively exploiting their environment while at the same time maintaining cohesion with other group members. Maintaining cohesion requires group members to come to consensus about when and where to move, despite the fact that they may not always agree. In this thesis, I investigate how individuals in groups make movement decisions, and how these individual decisions scale up to group-level properties. Using a laboratory experiment with golden shiners ( Notemigonus crysoleucas ), I first investigate the interaction network over which information spreads, finding that decisions are better predicted by whom individuals can see rather than whom they are close to, with potential consequences for the global spread of information (Chapter 2). I then investigate collective movement behavior in the wild using high-resolution GPS data from members of a troop of olive baboons ( Papio anubis ). I first show that baboons are consistent in the spatial positions they occupy within the group, and that the observed patterns may be understood based on a very simple mechanism by which individuals maintain cohesion with different numbers of their neighbors (Chapter 3). By quantifying how group members move relative to one another, I then show that baboon movement decisions are consistent with a shared decision-making process, rather than despotic leadership by dominant individuals, and that the patterns of decision-making are consistent with simple models of collective motion (Chapter 4). Finally, by incorporating a fine-scale, three-dimensional reconstruction of the habitat through which the baboons move, I show that habitat structure, in addition to social factors, also exerts an important influence on individual movement decisions, resulting in changes in the emergent structure and movement of the group (Chapter 5). Taken together, these results highlight that by combining high-resolution animal tracking, remote sensing, and analytical methods, we can begin to extend our understanding of collective animal movement from laboratory studies to complex animal societies living in the wild.",1844987467,,Dissertations & Theses," Strandburg-Peshkin, ArianaStrandburg-PeshkinArianaStrandburg-Peshkin, Ariana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4265621741 , 109354932 , 66569 , 9781369377651 , 10194675 , 10194675", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369377651, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1844987467?accountid=14496," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology"," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology"," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology",," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology"," Biology , Ecology , Zoology"," Biological sciences , Animal behavior , Collective behavior , Decision-making , Leadership , Movement , Self-organization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+fish+schools+to+primate+societies%3A+The+dynamics+of+collective+movement+in+animal+groups&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Strandburg-Peshkin%2C+Ariana&amp;isbn=9781369377651&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"866,Climate of framing: Beyond environmental racism and environmental justice in a neoliberal context,"This dissertation provides a sociological analysis of framing urban environmental crises. I ask how the environmental racism narrative of the late 20th century was framed by social movements, the waste management industry, and local and state government. Drawing on the corpus of qualitative data about environmental racism, I show how conventional social movements used a legal frame, raising moral questions about racism, to challenge the waste management industry. I use the case of Chester, PA to highlight the frame relationships between social movements, the waste management industry, and government. The legal frame’s failure to account for factors beyond race that determine environmental risk created discursive space for large scale polluters to shift the locus of questions from a legal to a political frame. I consider the lifespan of the environmental racism narrative and the rise of the current environmental justice narrative. Environmental justice social movements, in attempting to respond to the challenges of environmental racism as a legal strategy, are decentralized, globally focused, and they attempt to account for the constellation of interacting variables implicated in environmental burden. Nebulous SMOs highlight struggles of all poor and/or minority communities as a reflection of global climate change challenges such as human reliance on burning fossil fuels, production of waste itself, and the ways in which large-scale polluters externalize environmental risk. The waste management industry, however, captures the language of environmental justice SMOs to position itself as an environmental steward. The significance of this dissertation is in the framing interactivity of three seemingly distinct agents: social movements, large scale polluters, and government find themselves at different movements contesting or aligning with one another’s framing efforts. These layers of frames reveal unstable narratives.",1844988578,,Dissertations & Theses," Roby, ElizabethRobyElizabethRoby, Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4265622861 , 102310572 , 66569 , 9781369184884 , 10163847 , 10163847", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369184884, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1844988578?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Climate , Framing , Justice , Neoliberal , Racism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Climate+of+framing%3A+Beyond+environmental+racism+and+environmental+justice+in+a+neoliberal+context&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roby%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781369184884&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"867,Women as fish: Physical movement and social mobility in contemporary Vietnam,"This dissertation examines the changing rurality and the profound social stratification in contemporary Vietnam through the lens of rural-to-rural female migration. It is based on eighteen months of ethnographic research in a rural offshore fishing community in northern Vietnam called Hai Thành. I study the migration of two groups of women: 1) transnational women, who are young Hai Thành girls that marry Taiwanese and South Korean men, and migrate to mostly rural areas in East Asia, and 2) translocal women, who are women from other rural Vietnamese communities who migrate to Hai Thành to marry local men. My dissertation analyzes the relationship between movement and social class. It shows how female migration both sustains and transforms social hierarchies and binaries in unexpected ways via the embodiment of ethnicity, class, gender, age, and rurality, and practices of beauty, migration, education and morality. The double rural-to-rural female migration pattern in Hai Thành indicates that movement and social stratification are indicative of a complex rural landscape, and productive of modern and gendered rural subjectivities in Vietnam, which are produced through multiple political, cultural, historical and economic forces.",1845026584,,Dissertations & Theses," Nguyen, Linh KhanhNguyenKhanhLinhNguyen, Linh Khanh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4266974321 , 106813542 , 66569 , 9781369199055 , 10165529 , 10165529", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369199055, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845026584?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Migration , Mobilities , Morality , Rural , Social class , Vietnam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+as+fish%3A+Physical+movement+and+social+mobility+in+contemporary+Vietnam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nguyen%2C+Linh+Khanh&amp;isbn=9781369199055&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"868,Reshaping national imaginations in the midst of civil genocide: Denationalization in the Dominican Republic and transnational activism,"In the Dominican Republic, a 2013 Constitutional Tribunal ruling retroactively revoked the citizenship of over 200,000 Dominican nationals of Haitian descent, thus creating the fifth largest stateless population in the world and the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Building upon ethnographic research in the Dominican Republic and New York, as well as literature on race, nation, international human rights law and transnational activism, my dissertation, Reshaping National Imaginations in the Midst of Civil Genocide: Denationalization in the Dominican Republic and Transnational Activism, argues that despite the Dominican government's claim to sovereignty and legitimate legislation, it has designed the civil genocide of Dominicans of Haitian descent with racially discriminatory bureaucratic processes of historical continuity, that simultaneously signal a dangerous turn towards the legalization of clandestine human rights violations. This dissertation lays bare the relevance of state power despite the recent push to portray deterritorialization as a result of globalized processes. This research also posits that the political, economic and social solidarity between activists organizing against statelessness in Dominican Republic and the Dominican diaspora in New York creates innovative collaborative spaces for resistance and resilience, self-determination, demands for Dominican and U.S. state accountability and ultimately alternative national imaginations. Given the rise of several global social movements, including Black Lives Matter, the current election year in the Dominican Republic and the United States and shifts in modes of dispossession, this research puts forth a timely analysis of the increased denial of essential civil liberties, such as the autonomy to exercise one's right to citizenship.",1845027154,,Dissertations & Theses," Evangelista, JavielaEvangelistaJavielaEvangelista, Javiela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4266979861 , 101860132 , 66569 , 9781369200379 , 10165661 , 10165661", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369200379, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845027154?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Caribbean Studies"," Social sciences , Dominican Republic , Genocide , Human rights violations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reshaping+national+imaginations+in+the+midst+of+civil+genocide%3A+Denationalization+in+the+Dominican+Republic+and+transnational+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Evangelista%2C+Javiela&amp;isbn=9781369200379&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"869,"Insurgent diplomacy: El Salvador's transnational revolution, 1970–1992","Insurgent Diplomacy offers a transnational history of civil war in the Central American country of El Salvador in the last two decades of the Cold War. Centered on the diplomacy of the Salvadoran revolutionary organization, Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), this dissertation is both an international history of El Salvador and a Salvadoran insight into global history in the 1970s and 1980s. During this time, El Salvador became the epicenter of regional and international ambitions to transform the global order. It was here that international actors fought out their ideological battles and attempted—by influencing El Salvador—to shape broader regional and global dynamics. In turn, the FMLN capitalized on foreign involvement to further its own bids for political power. The revolutionaries’ diplomacy with foreign state and non-state actors from myriad countries around the globe shaped the course of the civil war and transformed the priorities of Salvadoran insurgent leaders, ultimately leading them to endorse a negotiated peace treaty. In turn, intervention in El Salvador altered the domestic politics of states, solidarity movements, and non-governmental organizations embroiled in the Salvadoran crisis. In this sense, the dissertation showcases how local and global processes influenced one another. Furthermore, by uncovering the diplomatic history of Salvadoran revolutionaries, this dissertation evidences the simultaneously fragmenting and integrative impact of the Cold War’s intrusion into local political conflicts. While regions became divided by national and geopolitical rivalries, a transnational community of activists, organizations, and international legal treaties fostered global interconnections that challenged prevailing notions of state-sovereignty and social activism, which had been at the base of international relations in the modern era. The FMLN’s insurgent diplomacy provides new insight into the dynamics of the Global Cold War and challenges the notion of an East-West axis as the fundamental driver of the global conflict. Ultimately, the international history of El Salvador uncovered in his dissertation provides the basis for understanding the country’s transition from political to apolitical violence in the aftermath of its civil war and foreshadows the limits of neo-liberal peace models that came about in the 1990s.",1845311639,,Dissertations & Theses," Onate-Madrazo, AndreaOnate-MadrazoAndreaOnate-Madrazo, Andrea",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4267982001 , 109385052 , 66569 , 9781369219623 , 10167614 , 10167614", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369219623, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845311639?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations",," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," Latin American history , International Relations"," Social sciences , Central America , Cold War , El Salvador , FMLN , Human rights , Revolutions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Insurgent+diplomacy%3A+El+Salvador%27s+transnational+revolution%2C+1970%E2%80%931992&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Onate-Madrazo%2C+Andrea&amp;isbn=9781369219623&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"870,A study on mobility: Pakistani-origin Muslim youth in higher education,"My dissertation is a multi-sited ethnography that investigates the gendered lifeworlds of transnational Pakistani-origin, Muslim college students in New York City and in Lahore, Pakistan. My ethnographic approach follows the multiple and overlapping mobility trajectories of transnational youth as marked by particular, semiotic practices and narratives. During the 16 months of fieldwork, my focal fieldsites—the hallways, dorms, student club- rooms, cafeterias, and libraries at two comparable college campuses—provided the interactional spaces where I could observe students developing their social and cultural selves. In my research, I found that the rural to urban migration pattern and concomitant imaginaries remained significant for both intra- and inter-national movements. My research examined students’ narratives about these multiscalar mobilities, analyzing emergent and locale-specific discursive and embodied practices in relation to transnational and piety-based markers of belonging. In this, I found that these practices both reified and critiqued traditional and modern notions of patriarchy. My study shows that mobility offers an ideal construct to ethnographically observe Pakistani-origin Muslim youth subject-making and to understand how transnational youth re-fashion their social identities and professional aspirations given contemporary post-9/11 political and social climate.",1845867458,,Dissertations & Theses," Durrani, MariamDurraniMariamDurrani, Mariam",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4269778071 , 105433322 , 66569 , 9781369338676 , 10190313 , 10190313", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369338676, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845867458?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0515 Education , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0515 Education , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0515 Education , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0515 Education , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0745 Higher education"," Cultural anthropology , Education , South Asian Studies , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Mobility , Muslim youth , Pakistan , Semiotic anthropology , South Asian youth , Transnational ethnography",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+mobility%3A+Pakistani-origin+Muslim+youth+in+higher+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Durrani%2C+Mariam&amp;isbn=9781369338676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"871,Solidarity Witness: Collective Resistance to the US Security State,"At the onset of the twenty-first century, the US security state exemplifies the kind of militarized social control that has become a key buttress to a global regime of deepening inequalities, injustices and indignities. This study explores how three social movement groups, broadly from the Christian left, majority white and middle-class, resist the US security state by envisioning and enacting solidarity with the state’s targets. Original data collection includes weeks of participant observation, forty-nine semi-structured interviews, fifty-four follow-up surveys, and an archive of hundreds of courtroom statements with three protest communities: 1) School of the Americas Watch, which seeks to close the military training facility at Ft. Benning, Georgia; 2) the Migrant Trail Walk, part of the US/Mexico border justice movement; and 3) Witness Against Torture, a grassroots effort to close the Guantánamo Bay Detention Center. I identify a political practice among these groups that I term solidarity witness by which these activists come to see, feel, and know injustices that do not most immediately impact them personally and then testify widely to the complex impacts of state violence. Solidarity witness is both performative and prefigurative. Through ritual protest and embodied, sometimes high-risk tactics, these activists expand the sphere of politics while nurturing internal cultures of opposition. Their mode of resistance reveals the importance of affect, embodiment and morality in social movement mobilization. While the groups in this study do intend to change state policies and institutions, their chances for melioristic reform have appeared to be small in practice. Their acts of ethical witness in the public sphere and principled refusal in close community instead highlight the limitations of policy change under a global, neoliberal security complex. In the face of impervious US political institutions and only the smallest pretense to real democracy, the practice of solidarity witness allows these activists to reckon with legacies of privilege tied to the oppression of others while also seeking to disinvest in this privilege in meaningful ways. Theirs is ultimately a conception of solidarity in which state violence and injustice impacts everyone, but in ways that must not be made equivalent. Solidarity witness allows these activists to satisfy a desire for self-respect, to craft a current existence that seems more dignified, moral, just and imaginative than their lives previously permitted, and to attach themselves to a collective struggle for a better future.",1846185857,,Dissertations & Theses," Russo, ChandraRussoChandraRusso, Chandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4270897621 , 104603912 , 66569 , 9781369146257 , 10159697 , 10159697", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369146257, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1846185857?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Christian left , Social movements , Solidarity activism , US Security State",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solidarity+Witness%3A+Collective+Resistance+to+the+US+Security+State&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Russo%2C+Chandra&amp;isbn=9781369146257&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"872,"Revolution from afar: Mobilizations for homeland regime change and the making of the Filipino diaspora, 1965-1992","From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Filipinos in the U.S. and the Netherlands became key players in international efforts to overthrow an oppressive regime and institute democracy in the Philippines. When Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972, Filipino student and political organizations in the U.S. immediately convened in San Francisco and launched a national campaign to oppose authoritarian rule. In less than a year, the movement spread as new organizations of diverse political orientations emerged and took root in long-established Filipino communities in the U.S. Activists focused on lobbying Congress for the withdrawal of military and economic support to Marcos. In the Netherlands, Filipino exile and solidarity organizations in Europe organized the Permanent People’s Tribunal on the Philippines in 1980 to expose and isolate the Marcos dictatorship and recognize the national liberation movements as the genuine representatives of the Filipino people. While much is known about why migrants maintain homeland ties, information on how they become engaged in organizations involved in political struggles remains scant. Through a comparative case study of homeland-directed activism among Filipinos in the U.S. and the Netherlands from the period of authoritarian rule (1965-1986) to the early years of democratic transition (1986-1992) in the Philippines, the project analyzes how political structures in both the host and home societies, resources in the migrant communities, and formation of oppositional consciousness interact and influence mobilization. Research findings show that variations in the emergence, growth, and outcomes of the movement in the two countries were due to dissimilar host-country conditions and the manner by which the interaction of economic, political, and social structures in the homeland and hostland provided opportunities and disincentives for mobilization. However, similar mechanisms and processes occurred in both the U.S. and Netherlands, although these differed with regard to actors and outcomes, depending on the historical context. Overall, the formation of diasporas is a consequence of strategic social construction by political entrepreneurs in periods of heightened contention in the homeland such as during dictatorship and regime change. Thus, diasporas are outcomes, rather than causes or agents, of transnational mobilization.",1847566640,,Dissertations & Theses," Quinsaat, Sharon MadriagaQuinsaatMadriagaSharonQuinsaat, Sharon Madriaga",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4273771371 , 109535082 , 66569 , 9781369418484 , 10298833 , 10298833", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369418484, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1847566640?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Asian American Studies , Social research , Political science , Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Diaspora , Filipino , Homeland , Mobilizations , Regime , Revolution",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revolution+from+afar%3A+Mobilizations+for+homeland+regime+change+and+the+making+of+the+Filipino+diaspora%2C+1965-1992&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Quinsaat%2C+Sharon+Madriaga&amp;isbn=9781369418484&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"873,"From crisis to crisis: A big data, antenarrative analysis of how social media users make meaning during and after crisis events","This dissertation examines how individuals use social media to respond to crisis situations, both during and after the event. Using both rhetorical criticism and David Boje’s theories and concepts regarding the development of antenarrative—a process of making sense of past, present, and future events—I explored how social media users make sense of and respond to a crisis. Specifically, my research was guided by three major questions: • Are traditional, pre-social media image-repair strategies effective in social media environments? • How do participants use social media in crisis events, and how does this usage shape the rhetorical framing of a crisis? • How might organizations effectively adapt traditional crisis communication plans to be used in social media during future crisis events? These questions were applied to four case studies to provide a range of insights about not only how individuals respond to a crisis, but also what strategies organizations use to present information about it. These cases were carefully selected to include a variety of crisis types and responses and include the following: • A business (H&amp;R Block) communicating to clients about a software error • A governmental organization (the NTSB) presenting information about the cause of an airplane crash and about missteps in its response • A governmental group (the CDC) responding to a global health crisis with various audiences and types of responses • An activist movement (Black Lives Matter) attempting to unify social media users to lobby for change and highlight the scope of the issues to the nation Analyses of these cases not only show how individuals and groups used social media to make sense of crisis events, but also how the rhetorical strategies used to respond to a crisis situation. Understanding how individuals and groups make sense of crises will provide additional understanding to information designers, public relations professionals, organizations and businesses, and individuals using social media to effect change.",1848287244,,Dissertations & Theses," Bair, Adam R.BairR.AdamBair, Adam R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4276916651 , 109600852 , 66569 , 9781369237573 , 10169569 , 10169569", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369237573, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1848287244?accountid=14496, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric,, 0681 Rhetoric, Rhetoric," Language, literature and linguistics , Antenarrative , Crisis communication , Rhetorical criticism , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+crisis+to+crisis%3A+A+big+data%2C+antenarrative+analysis+of+how+social+media+users+make+meaning+during+and+after+crisis+events&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bair%2C+Adam+R.&amp;isbn=9781369237573&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"874,Street Fight: Urban Climate Politics in an Age of Finance and Revolt,"Scholars and policy-makers agree that through smart densification policies that intervene on housing, transit, and land use (termed gray ecologies), global cities can improve their quality of life while slashing heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. But policy implementation has stagnated. Why? Meanwhile, climate-linked extreme weather has begun to strike these cities just as they renew their efforts to tackle emissions. What effect does really existing climate change have on cities’ climate efforts? This dissertation addresses these questions through studies of two exemplary cases of low-carbon ambition and stuttering implementation, one from the Global North, the other from the Global South—New York and São Paulo. It also tracks the impact of a climate-linked hurricane on New York’s climate politics, and a historic drought on São Paulo’s. Breaking from the tradition of urban climate studies, which only follows the narrow social realm of climate policy makers, this dissertation reconceptualizes the field of urban climate politics on the basis of “social backcasting”—using our most reliable expectations of the future to develop analytic categories to understand the present and recent past, with an interest in uncovering multiple possible futures and unseen climate protagonists. Using this method of following the carbon into the viscera of social life, the dissertation focuses on three sets of actors who are working to transform the substance of urban densification policies: green policy elites, city planners, and housing-oriented social movements. And in an age of finance and revolt, the dissertation examines the impacts that growing inequalities associated with the rise of finance have on urban climate policies; and on the ways that revolts against those inequalities shape the policies’ fortunes. The dissertation finds that policies have stagnated when center-right mayors have pursued luxury ecology programs that would have mainly benefited professional class urban residents, and which were resisted—actively or passively—by housing-oriented movements concerned about displacement and gentrification. On the other hand, there is some evidence that when, through the intermediary of center-left mayoral regimes, green policy elites and housing-oriented movements cooperate, it is easier to make progress on democratic gray ecology projects that reduce emissions and social inequalities in the short-term. Mayoral leadership matters—but in interaction with political substance, political style, and political context. Meanwhile, the core factors influencing success or failure of low-carbon policies in prosperous global cities are more similar than different across the North-South divide. The dissertation also finds that climate-linked extreme weather tends to bring some green policy elites closer to housing-oriented movements. But if there is an automatic social response to climate-linked extreme weather, it is to shift political emphasis from attacking climate change’s root causes by cutting emissions to local self-defense, in a fortress of solitude logic. Nevertheless, in a context of strong political mobilization, focused on the intersection of climate change as such and local housing and transit issues, it is possible for newly formed civil society alliances to also press successfully for a combination of defensive and low-carbon policies. These dynamics hold in both the global North and South, and in conditions of both too much and too little water. But the relationship between self defense and carbon reductions is especially important in the most prosperous, Northern global cities, where cutting-edge carbon accounting shows that wealthy urban residents (and wealthy cities in general) are much more responsible for greenhouse gas emissions—in spite of dense living arrangements—than was previously known.",1851000594,,Dissertations & Theses," Cohen, Daniel AldanaCohenAldanaDanielCohen, Daniel Aldana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4284277111 , 102533342 , 66569 , 9781369340419 , 10192226 , 10192226", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369340419, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1851000594?accountid=14496," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning"," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning"," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning",," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning"," Environmental Studies , Sociology , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Climate change , Environmental sociology , Political sociology , Social movements , Social theory , Urban studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Street+Fight%3A+Urban+Climate+Politics+in+an+Age+of+Finance+and+Revolt&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cohen%2C+Daniel+Aldana&amp;isbn=9781369340419&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"875,Three essays on Mexico-U.S. migration,"Migration flow between Mexico and the United States is historically the largest South-North international population movement in the world. Nowadays, Mexicans in the United States are more than 12 million people and represent about a third of all Hispanics living in this country. Not only Mexicans are a voluminous group, but also a large minority with strong ties with their communities of origin, important amounts of remittances, and more recently, high rates of return migration. Their transnational behaviors and the changes in their situation in the United States posit several research questions in the area of migrant incorporation. In this dissertation, I explore three salient topics in the new agenda of the migrant incorporation research. I use diverse data sources from Mexico and the United Sates, and a comprehensive set of analytic strategies that include qualitative and quantitative methods. First, I pay attention to the consequences of migration enforcement laws and economic crisis on the labor market incorporation of Mexican return migrants in the decade of the 2000s. Specially, I focus on the extent to which these migrants have been absorbed into the precarious areas of the informal economy. Second, I analyze the mental health of Mexican immigrants in Durham, NC, in comparison to their Mexican counterparts in their places of origin. I look at the changes in the associations of depression feelings with protective and risk factors upon migration. Then, I analyze the role of migration-related characteristics, such as legal status, family separation and English proficiency, among others. With this analysis, I seek to understand how different theories explain the mental health disadvantage of immigrants. Finally, I describe the gendered links between transnational family dynamics and support modes to the elderly. Overall, from these three chapters I conclude that migrants in both, sending and receiving societies, are currently facing strong challenges to incorporate upon their movement. Financial constraints, precarious labor conditions, family separation, and depression feelings are some of the many situations impeding migrants to experience smooth migration transitions and difficult their subsequent social incorporation.",1853205651,,Dissertations & Theses," Gutierrez Vazquez, Edith YolandaGutierrez VazquezYolandaEdithGutierrez Vazquez, Edith Yolanda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4287628021 , 106377242 , 66569 , 9781369338768 , 10190738 , 10190738", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369338768, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1853205651?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology , 0938 Demography"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology , 0938 Demography"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology , 0938 Demography",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0626 Sociology , 0938 Demography"," Latin American Studies , International Relations , Sociology , Demography"," Social sciences , Depressed feelings , Elder support , International migration , Mexico , Migrant incorporation , Return migration , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+essays+on+Mexico-U.S.+migration&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gutierrez+Vazquez%2C+Edith+Yolanda&amp;isbn=9781369338768&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"876,Grassroots activists and movements against female genital mutilation and cutting bridged with political alliances: Agency power and the potential to bring about change,"In this thesis I highlight grassroots activists and social movements/mobilization against FGM/C throughout some of the regions where it's concentrated, and consider the political alliances that have aided these activists and their movements towards declines in the prevalence of the practice. I consider the recent outlawing of the practice in the Gambia (last year) which was strongly motivated by grassroots activists originally from the Gambia and the transnational political alliances they were able to form. I examine activists and movements in Senegal, paying particular attention to the approach of NGO TOSTAN. I also highlight long standing histories of grassroots activism against FGM/C in Kenya, a country which has seen large scale declines in the practice over the last several decades. In addition to highlighting areas that are witnessing declines in FGM/C, I consider Somalia where FGM/C has not been outlawed, and declines are not evident but public outreach against FGM/C is being engaged in within a context of providing maternal, infant and child health care. I emphasize the agency indigenous or “native” women show in challenging “traditional” “cultural” practices they themselves were subjected to at a young (nonconsensual) age. I propose the need for continued political, social and (in some cases) religious support in their endeavors, alliances outside of individual agency to challenge dominant power structures and traditional sociocultural customs. My research questions are 1) Is the prevalence of FGM/C based on these women being victims of patriarchal and patrilineal male power structures that need to be updated and modified, or are these women already exercising agency and power in perpetuating the continuation of this practice? 2) Are larger structural and power dynamics worth closer analysis, for example, can access to education, gainful employment, financial security outside of marriage and changes in property and inheritance laws, change the perceived necessity of the practice? 3) Are grassroots activists against the practice being ignored and silenced under the guise of maintaining the appearance of distinct cultural homogeneity and otherness from Western neocolonial powers? 4) How can women from and/or based in the West legitimately form alliances with grassroots activists and involve themselves in global issues of women’s human rights, and not come across as patronizing and ethnocentric? 5) What is the potential for declines and modifications of these practices once laws outlawing them are put in place? Using current data on laws against FGM/C, and the prevalence of FGM/C within certain sociocultural power dynamics, I emphasize the initiative grassroots activists and movements show in combating these practices and explore the potential for continued declines in prevalence, along with changes in attitudes towards women and their bodies that have justified its existence to date.",1861678282,,Dissertations & Theses," Kearney, AishaKearneyAishaKearney, Aisha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4307840741 , 105007422 , 66569 , 9781369413809 , 10246272 , 10246272", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369413809, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1861678282?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Activists , Africa , Agency , Female genital mutilation/cutting , Power , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grassroots+activists+and+movements+against+female+genital+mutilation+and+cutting+bridged+with+political+alliances%3A+Agency+power+and+the+potential+to+bring+about+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kearney%2C+Aisha&amp;isbn=9781369413809&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"877,Diaspora Social Movements in Cyberspace: Epistemological and Ethnographic Considerations,"The concept that social networks impact individual and organizational choices is as old as Sociology itself. Theorist from Durkheim to Simmel, and Weber to Parsons have all struggled with how to quantify and measure the real or imagined influence of social structures on individual choice. Network analysis proceeds from a similar framework as structuralism in that is assumes that the choices of one individual will be constrained by their place within the broader interconnectivity of the other actors. Interpretation then is based on the assumption that ones networks can be categorized, and that the meaning derived from that network are the same for all individuals within it. Several theoretical papers call these assumptions into question, but researchers examining online networks, especially from an international social movement perspective, have yet to examine their methods to verify that they capture the full extent of online networks, and if everyone associated with the network understands their place in it the same way. Our ability to gather and analyze data far outstrips our theorizing. In this dissertation I will examine the assumptions about what constitutes a network based on current collection techniques and show the current methods produce a systemic bias that cannot account for the entire issue based network, leading to errors in interpretation and the false identification of movement leaders. The new method, called Query Driven Sampling (QDS), uses webmaster tools to accurately record the missing inbound links and more fully complete the network compared to the outbound/co-link method. The second chapter will examine online Kurdish activism using the QDS method. With this method I demonstrate how online social activists within diasporic settings react differently to perceived risk even within the same ethnic community. In the final chapter I ask Kurdish activists to explain from their perspective, how they conceptualize, interact and grow their activist network. Results from these analyses challenge the ability of current methods to accurately define what constitutes a network, to properly identify the key actors within the network, and correctly identify how state level immigration policies influence offline security and how understand how this translates into online behavior.",1867055206,,Dissertations & Theses," Stearmer, Steven MatthewStearmerMatthewStevenStearmer, Steven Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313113111 , 109723552 , 66569 , 9781369556605 , 10308543 , 10308543", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369556605, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867055206?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies",," 0626 Sociology , 0646 Web Studies"," Sociology , Web Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Ethnic social movements , Kurd , Network analysis , Online networks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Diaspora+Social+Movements+in+Cyberspace%3A+Epistemological+and+Ethnographic+Considerations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stearmer%2C+Steven+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781369556605&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"878,The revolution will come home: Gendered violence and transformative organizing from the Philippines to the U.S.,"“The Revolution Will Come Home” explores how urban poor women in Metro Manila are challenging interpersonal gendered violence—such as domestic abuse or sexual assault— within the communities they organize, while building a broader movement against neoliberal capitalism and U.S. empire. GABRIELA, the largest women’s federation in the Philippines, fights for ‘home’ on multiple scales—offering a case study of a ‘social movements approach’ to gendered violence that draws on and adapts grassroots traditions, local and transnational feminisms, as well as Third World nationalist and Marxist-Leninist-Maoist organizing legacies. As U.S. empire and neoliberal restructuring enact gendered violence, often under the guise of ‘humanitarian aid’ and ‘gender-responsive’ development, GABRIELA challenges a ‘neoliberal imperial’ feminist order, reconfiguring its logics. Using oral history, survey, and archival methods, this dissertation considers how addressing interpersonal gendered violence can support, rather than hinder, movement-building, grassroots leadership, and the transformation of participants. Instead of writing off trauma as drama, local organizers treat processes of interpersonal and societal change as interdependent. Collectives offer spaces of healing and constrained accountability for intimate partner and sexual violence, while organizers adapt an ethic of ‘serving the people’ to provide survivor-centered support that tides over cycles of violence. A ‘social movements approach’ towards interpersonal gendered violence and trauma not only can provide more accessible and transformative assistance to those affected—but moreover, has societal transformation as its goal, treating survivors as potential organizers in a movement for collective change, rather than as passive service recipients. I place strategies of this Third World women’s organization in conversation with U.S. women of color feminist critiques of carceral responses to gendered violence—and with their calls for ‘transformative organizing,’ ‘community accountability’ tactics that do not rely on state structures, and decolonization, as alternatives.",1867590373,,Dissertations & Theses," Chew, Huibin A.ChewA.HuibinChew, Huibin A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313462591 , 109184352 , 66569 , 9781369474459 , 10244847 , 10244847", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369474459, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867590373?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0323 American studies , 0342 Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," American studies , Asian Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Domestic abuse , Filipino women's organizing , Gendered violence , Metro manila , Social movements , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+revolution+will+come+home%3A+Gendered+violence+and+transformative+organizing+from+the+Philippines+to+the+U.S.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chew%2C+Huibin+A.&amp;isbn=9781369474459&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"879,The key to peace is ours: Women's peacebuilding in twenty-first century Colombia,"My dissertation investigates the role of women activists in the construction of peace in twenty-first century Colombia, combining a social movement studies framework with feminist, antimilitarist political economy. It is a a multi-method, feminist ethnography of three networks of women’s peace organizations founded in Colombia in the mid-1990s: Ruta Pacífica de Mujeres, the Movimiento Social de Mujeres Contra la Guerra y Por la Paz, and the Red de Mujeres del Caribe Colombiano. In it I show that by directing material and symbolic claims at the key structural foundations of armed conflict, women’s peace activism is fomenting a unfying, counterhegemonic social movement voice in the country. The dissertation is divided into two parts. The first traces the history of the women’s peace movement, and finds that it arose from a feminist movement born into armed conflict and have never had a safe space to operate. Since the 1990s the Colombian women’s movements have been joining to form national-level networks and gaining transnational legitimacy and visibility. Nonetheless, activists continue to face persistent challenges from within and without, beyond the persistence of war: notably, the concentration of movement resources among urban elites and the exclusion of feminists of color who live in outlying regions. Despite this, my dissertation argues that women peace activists are subverting many of the presumptions inherent to Colombia’s conflict and its longevity. In the second section, I identify four key personae on the stage of war and its discourse: confusion, victimhood, the body, and peace. I argue that each has played an important role in perpetuating and strengthening the patriarchal, militarized capital accumulation at the heart of the conflict, and that the activists under study are appropriating and reinterpreting these personae in such a way as to destabilize the foundations of war in the country. Using data gathered with several qualitative methodologies, including ethnographic observation, semistructured interviews, and archival research, I conclude that their organizing represents a potentially counterhegemonic, unifying social movement force that has the potential to play a transformative role in Colombia’s new reality.",1868419047,,Dissertations & Theses," Paarlberg-Kvam, Katherine S.Paarlberg-KvamS.KatherinePaarlberg-Kvam, Katherine S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313808801 , 105437752 , 66569 , 9781369455083 , 10246927 , 10246927", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369455083, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868419047?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," Womens studies , Latin American Studies , Peace Studies"," Social sciences , Activism , Colombia , Militarism , Peace , Political economy , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+key+to+peace+is+ours%3A+Women%27s+peacebuilding+in+twenty-first+century+Colombia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paarlberg-Kvam%2C+Katherine+S.&amp;isbn=9781369455083&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"880,"Death on the move: Burial, repatriation, and the politics of belonging among Muslims in Germany","This dissertation examines what happens to migrant bodies after they die. It demonstrates that the governance of the dead is intimately linked to the construction of the nation and the enactment of sovereignty. Through a comparative study of the mortuary practices of ethno-religious minorities in Germany, it highlights the ways that death structures political membership and identity. By tracing the actors, networks, and institutions that determine the movement of dead bodies within and across international borders, it analyzes how relations between authority, territory, and populations are managed at a transnational level. The dissertation builds on extensive, multi-sited fieldwork conducted in Berlin and Istanbul in 2013-15. Drawing on interviews and participant observation with bereaved families, Muslim undertakers, government officials, religious leaders, and representatives of funeral aid societies, I show how the corpse functions as a political object by structuring claims about citizenship, belonging, and collective identity. I argue that families, religious communities, and states all have a vested interest in the fate of dead bodies. Further, I demonstrate that in contexts where the boundaries of the nation and its demos are contested, burial decisions are political decisions. Focusing primarily on Turkish and Kurdish communities, I show how decisions about where and how to be buried are linked to larger political struggles over the meaning of home and homeland. While burial in Germany offers a symbolically powerful means for migrants and their children to assert political membership and foster a sense of belonging, the widespread practice of posthumous repatriation illustrates the continued importance of transnational ties and serves as an indictment of an exclusionary socio-political order. In both situations, the corpse is central to localizing and grounding political claims for recognition and inclusion. As I show, this is a highly contentious process wherein different factions, including states and civil society organizations, struggle over where dead bodies should go and what they should signify. In highlighting the role that burial decisions play in the negotiation of social, cultural, and political boundaries, this dissertation contributes to a growing body of literature on how the long-term settlement of Muslim immigrants is transforming European societies.",1868839429,,Dissertations & Theses," Balkan, OsmanBalkanOsmanBalkan, Osman",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314643011 , 102101512 , 66569 , 9781369510805 , 10195778 , 10195778", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369510805, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868839429?accountid=14496," 0440 European Studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0440 European Studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0440 European Studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0440 European Studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science"," European Studies , Islamic Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Death and bereavement , Immigration and integration , Islamic funerary services , Muslims in Germany , Necropolitics , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Death+on+the+move%3A+Burial%2C+repatriation%2C+and+the+politics+of+belonging+among+Muslims+in+Germany&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Balkan%2C+Osman&amp;isbn=9781369510805&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"881,"Constructing Adolescent Social Identities in the Context of Globalization and Transnationalism: A Case Study of Five Adolescents in Innsbruck, Austria, and Their Engagement with Hip Hop","This qualitative study addresses the research problem of understanding and theorizing the construction of social identity among adolescents in the current context of globalization and transnationalism. To address the question, the study focused on five young men in Innsbruck, Austria, who were self-described ""hip hoppers."" Hip hop is more than a musical style; it is a complex, diverse, and sometimes contradictory social and cultural movement and ideology that is both global and local. It lies at the nexus of globalization and transnationalism, playing itself out in diverse ways in local settings globally. The theoretical perspective of the study emphasized the variability and contextual embeddedness of social identities as part of the performativity of identity (a theory espoused by Butler). This theoretical perspective argues that social identity is multiple and iterative, meaning that participants are continually enacting and modifying their social identities as their contexts change over time and space. Social identity is, according to this study, socially constructed and governed by the relationships and environments in which the participants function. The sociolinguistic principles guiding this study are analyzed derived from microethnographic discourse analysis. The spoken linguistic codes performed by the participants and the literacy practices these codes enable the subject to not only their own social constructions, but those given to their practical cultural environments. Language is viewed as a code through which the participants can communicate their hip hop affinities and an inclusion in a hip hop community. The methodologies and research methods employed in this study are compatible with the principles and practices of ethnographic and sociolinguistic research as are the values placed on individuals experience and agency in various contexts and how they are revealed to the researcher. The logic of inquiry for the study was informed overall by ethnographic epistemology that is research sought to identify the individual particularities of individuals deeply embedded in the various contexts of their existence and how those aspects change over time, space, and relationships. As in ethnography, this qualitative study aims to acknowledge a full range of experiences and the ways that they are embedded within variable contexts and as they are interpreted by the ethnographer who is engaged with the participants. Methods involve both emic and etic interpretations. The study took place over 18 months in the two Innsbruck area high schools where the participants attended. Data collection included participant observation, lexical survey, individual and paired interviews, as well as participant-recorded videos of hip hop activity. Data analysis involved (a) thematic analysis which is consistent with grounded theory; and (b) abductive interpretation (analogic reasoning). The major findings of the study regarding the construction of social identity were: • the influence of global and local relationships, • that identities were idealized and performed iteratively, • authenticity as a central motivation, and • the role of tensions between collectivism and individualism as societal ideologies.",1870809176,,Dissertations & Theses," Averill, JuliaAverillJuliaAverill, Julia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316631881 , 111042042 , 66569 , 9781369517316 , 10307149 , 10307149", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369517316, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870809176?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education,, 0515 Education, Education," Education , Austria , Authenticity , Global-local , Hip hop , Social identity , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+Adolescent+Social+Identities+in+the+Context+of+Globalization+and+Transnationalism%3A+A+Case+Study+of+Five+Adolescents+in+Innsbruck%2C+Austria%2C+and+Their+Engagement+with+Hip+Hop&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Averill%2C+Julia&amp;isbn=9781369517316&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"882,"The strategic use of ""The Face of Apartheid"": Examining Mondoweiss blog activists' claims-making and protest activities over the Scarlett Johansson and SodaStream controversy","I rely upon the ideas of symbolic interaction generally and the social constructionist approach to social movements in particular to explore the ways in which blog activists strategically use celebrity to generate attention on behalf the BDS campaign against SodaStream and to communicate claims and grievances on behalf of the wider Palestinian movement. Using grounded theory and mix-methods, I employed a process-oriented approach to collect and analyze three types of data: 1. text, 2. images, and 3. data I created quantitatively from the qualitative data extracted from Mondoweiss blog articles published from January to March 2014. The study addressed 1. in what ways blog activists strategically use celebrity to draw attention to the wider Palestinian movement’s claims and grievances; and 2. how blog activists maintained enduring interest in campaign activities for mobilizing social action and social change over time. The study examined how the SodaStream announcement of the Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson as their Global Brand Ambassador, which blog activities immediately labeled her as The Face of Apartheid , was used as an opportunity to provoke a response from the celebrity and to contest the authenticity of her reputation as a humanitarian fighting to end poverty. I identify how blog activities strategically utilize Johansson in multiple ways to problematize her as a spectacle to communicate claims and to generate attention. Blog activists utilized her responses as a further opportunity to strategically use her celebrity to sustain interest by politicizing her humanitarian reputation. This was intended to motivate action as they attached their contestation over her humanitarian reputation to key external issues surrounding the BDS campaign against SodaStream; ultimately legitimizing The Face of Apartheid label, a celebrity who chose to be on the wrong side of history.",1872302967,,Dissertations & Theses," O'Connor-DeLosRios, Divinity BridgetO'Connor-DeLosRiosBridgetDivinityO'Connor-DeLosRios, Divinity Bridget",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317318421 , 105977752 , 66569 , 9781369528923 , 10245252 , 10245252", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369528923, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872302967?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , BDS campaign against SodaStream , Blog activists and social movement creative tactics and strategies , Johansson, Scarlett , Mixed/qualitative and quantitative methods , Palestine , Perceived threat opportunity , Qualitative methods , Turning points",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+strategic+use+of+%22The+Face+of+Apartheid%22%3A+Examining+Mondoweiss+blog+activists%27+claims-making+and+protest+activities+over+the+Scarlett+Johansson+and+SodaStream+controversy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Connor-DeLosRios%2C+Divinity+Bridget&amp;isbn=9781369528923&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"883,The franchising effect on the Al-Qaeda enterprise and related transnational terror groups: Patterns of evolution of Al-Qaeda affiliates in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century,"The attacks of September 11, 2001 by Al-Qaeda-sponsored militants represented a high- water mark for the terrorist organization in its self-styled journey to become the inspirational Islamic vanguard for disenchanted Muslims across the globe. In the years that followed these attacks, the Al-Qaeda enterprise underwent a constant rate of evolution and mutation, resulting in a phenomenon of parallel and like-minded Islamist groups pledging allegiance to Usama bin Laden and his ideological vision of a global jihad. Instead of strengthening the overall organization, this expansion diluted the command and control of Al-Qaeda senior leaders in their ability to shape the overall movement it once led, as well as displaced the locus of power for the larger movement among various powerbrokers with unpredictable agendas and worldviews. Instead, the affiliation and franchising of parallel groups proved to result in only temporary changes in organizational behavior of these affiliates, as the domestic social, political, and economic forces present in these regions and nation-states had much more effect on Al-Qaeda affiliates and their members than the traditional Al-Qaeda agenda. This dissertation is innovative in comparing Al-Qaeda Central in 2001 to its corollary manifestations as Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) across four variables of study and across time. The findings of this study help to explain the evolution of Al-Qaeda as the most capable and feared terrorist organization that it occupied at the beginning of the decade into a vague conglomerate of affiliates and sub-groups fifteen years later. The short term gains offered by affiliation for parallel movements under the AQ brand were exploited by these affiliates for their own particular interests, but ultimately discarded for domestic welfare of the affiliates themselves, even running counter to the transnational agenda of Bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda. Breaking new ground, this research attempts to understand the evolution of the organization through the affiliation of parallel movements, what effect this affiliation has, and to identify signposts and patterns that can be overlaid on future manifestations of the global Islamic jihadist movement, either under Al-Qaeda leadership or some other organization.",1873029398,,Dissertations & Theses," Law, Nicholas BenjaminLawBenjaminNicholasLaw, Nicholas Benjamin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317737671 , 106169022 , 66569 , 9781369538465 , 10245617 , 10245617", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369538465, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873029398?accountid=14496," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations",," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations"," Islamic Studies , Middle Eastern Studies , International Relations"," Social sciences , Al-Qaeda , Dispersion , Fragmentation , Islam , Jihad , Terrorism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+franchising+effect+on+the+Al-Qaeda+enterprise+and+related%0Atransnational+terror+groups%3A+Patterns+of+evolution+of+Al-Qaeda+affiliates+in+the+21st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Law%2C+Nicholas+Benjamin&amp;isbn=9781369538465&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"884,"""Rhodes Must Fall"": South Africa's Ongoing University Student Protests Against Contemporary Globalization's Neoliberal Violence","Despite apartheid’s 1994 de jure abolition, contemporary university students in South Africa transgressively protest for ongoing, radical, de facto “decolonization” that they allege, and I agree, has not occurred. My thesis historicizes and analyzes the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF) and Open Stellenbosch (OS) protests at University of Cape Town (UCT) and Stellenbosch University (SU), respectively. I analyze how university students’ protests drive counter-hegemonic social movements locally, regionally, and potentially globally. I highlight marginalized students’ imagination and articulation of alternatives to global neoliberalism, which is transgressive and perceived as radical. I contextualize this case study of contemporary counter-hegemony in South Africa through a theoretical-conceptual approach, and a deep, colonial, historical approach. I present three critical premises: (1) neoliberalism is de-democratization and covert authoritarianism; (2) universities are potential sites of critical democratization; and (3) marginalized university students drive a radical, transgressive imagination of alternative worlds. I provide critical historical background to situate South Africa within Contemporary Globalization before chronicling the emergent themes of ongoing protests. Following my South Africa case study, I briefly compare RMF and OS to other university student protests around the globe, including California and Germany. I suggest that under Contemporary Globalization, apparently dissimilar social movements share much in common, including universities’ simultaneous assimilation into, and potential for resistance against, the new, covert authoritarianism and de-democratization of global neoliberalism.",1876699031,,Dissertations & Theses," Irvine, TimothyIrvineTimothyIrvine, Timothy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4320469891 , 111327952 , 66569 , 9781369576269 , 10245037 , 10245037", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369576269, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1876699031?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0654 South African Studies , 0745 Higher education"," 0601 International Relations , 0654 South African Studies , 0745 Higher education"," 0601 International Relations , 0654 South African Studies , 0745 Higher education",," 0601 International Relations , 0654 South African Studies , 0745 Higher education"," International Relations , South African Studies , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Colonialism , Democracy , Hegemony , Neoliberalism , South Africa , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Rhodes+Must+Fall%22%3A+South+Africa%27s+Ongoing+University+Student+Protests+Against+Contemporary+Globalization%27s+Neoliberal+Violence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Irvine%2C+Timothy&amp;isbn=9781369576269&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"885,"Building the Service Employees International Union: Janitors and Chicago Politics, 1911-1968","As one of the few expanding and politically powerful unions in the county, many have argued that the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) represents the future of the American labor movement. However, few scholars have devoted much attention to the early days of the organization. My dissertation partially fills this gap in the literature by examining the foundation and evolution of the organization in Chicago between 1912 and 1969. During this period, the SEIU in Chicago developed a particular approach to labor activity—what I call civic unionism—that emphasized political power over labor militancy and prefigured modern trends in the labor movement such as community and social movement unionism. Through this approach, the union helped unskilled workers, most prominently janitors, to achieve higher wages, power in the workplace, and a sense of professional dignity. Although these successes represent significant victories, civic unionism proved far from perfect. By committing the union to the defense of the status quo it required the organization to defend the corrupt machine politics of Chicago and blunted any larger social agenda that they might have pursued. Ultimately these compromises resulted in both internal corruption and internecine conflicts that caused significant damage to the organization. Despite its faults, the civic unionism of the Chicago SEIU deserves study not only as a prelude to the modern organization, and modern organizational concepts, but also as a distinctive form of unionism that challenges many of the basic categories in which unions are normally classified. Seeing Chicago from the perspective of the union also provides unique insights into the city's political, social, and economic development.",1876895385,,Dissertations & Theses," Peterson, Benjamin L.PetersonL.BenjaminPeterson, Benjamin L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4320599981 , 109641142 , 66569 , 9781369603576 , 10470891 , 10470891", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369603576, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1876895385?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Building service employees international union , Chicago , Corruption , Flat janitors , Marina city , Politics , Richard j. daley , Scalise, George , Service employees international union , Sullivan, David",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+the+Service+Employees+International+Union%3A+Janitors+and+Chicago+Politics%2C+1911-1968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peterson%2C+Benjamin+L.&amp;isbn=9781369603576&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"886,B corp: Insights for a new economy,"In a time of unprecedented change, our current economy is structured to serve a dying past rather than to create a new sustainable future. Economic activity as we know it has resulted in many of the current social and environmental challenges we face locally and globally. A New Economy is needed that is better structured to create economic stability and prosperity, a more just society, and a regenerative ecology out of the rapid changes of the next century. B Corp is a unified group of businesses claiming to lead a movement for such an economy. This project interviewed 50 B Corp founders from across the U.S. to explore their values, ideas, and beliefs including why and how they created companies that benefit society and the environment, how they articulate the New Economy, and how they view the strengths, weaknesses, and potential political significance of their movement. Comparing the interview insights with a comprehensive literature review results in three overarching goals and seven guiding principles for a New Economy. Economic theory beginning with Adam Smith’s classical economics is explored as an underpinning to the trajectory of the current economy. Modern social movement theory describes how the B Corp movement builds on previous direct action for economic reform, such as the Global Justice Movement, and provides insights into what could make the movement succeed or fail. Finally, Futures Studies methods and generational cohort analysis are engaged to design a useful vision of a stable, prosperous, just, ecological sound future New Economy in 2030 led by an older Millennial generation that have replaced the Baby Boomers in occupying positions of power, leadership, and authority and enacted the recommendations from this research.",1883339866,,Dissertations & Theses," Trevenna, ShanahTrevennaShanahTrevenna, Shanah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321388983 , 109472522 , 66569 , 9781369678291 , 10587367 , 10587367", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369678291, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883339866?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Business leadership , Economy , Political economy , Social entrepreneurship , Sustainable business , Triple bottom line",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=B+corp%3A+Insights+for+a+new+economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Trevenna%2C+Shanah&amp;isbn=9781369678291&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"887,Conceptualizing the State-Nation via Education Reform: From Multicultural to Intercultural Citizenship,"Transnational movements of sociopolitical culture defy the integrity of the nation-state. Its organizational principle of singularity, and struggles to accommodate increasing diversity within homogeneity, are challenged by the increasing prominence of alternate and multiple ways of being and knowing. Nation-state education systems organized to deliver citizenship values, fail to rectify the fracture between their quest for multicultural participation and their promotion of conformity within a single ‘national’ identity. Systems of education are products of their respective sociopolitical systems. Hence, notions of citizenship (inclusion) and democracy (participation) must be reformed to facilitate genuine education reform. The nation-state is a sociopolitical project that confines pedagogical reform within the framework of a paradigm. Education reform can only be achieved by substituting the concept of multi-cultural, with inter-cultural citizenship, thereby transforming the unidimensional nation-state into a pluralist state-nation. The state-nation is an ideal-type conceptual framework which is predicated upon a constant (re-)negotiation of categories and their corresponding belonging-identities, so that all boundaries remain liminal and permeable rather than immutable and exclusionary. India has witnessed the longest sustained attempt at education reform, as well as the largest in size and scope, by any national government, international organization or non-government organization. This dissertation examines the participation of statist, civil society and multi-national participants, within the context of education reform in India.

It is a study of a community’s political action hand in hand with their cosmopolitan imagination and nostalgic feelings in their engagement with the IIFF, when Turkey increasingly lurched towards authoritarianism in the 2010s. Through the increasing number of festival films and events that went against the dominant ideology in Turkey, this audience community embraced an activist cosmopolitanism which set the ground for political action. It scrutinises their formation of nostalgic feelings for the historical spaces in Beyoğlu, developed jointly by their anti-neoliberal discourses while also displaying their political action against the top-down urban regeneration programmes. In order to account for their political activism, revolving initially around festival spaces and then occupied parks, I conducted an ethnographic research at the festival and the Gezi uprising from 2013 to 2014. Employing participant observation, life histories and in-depth interviews, this research examines the intricacies of human relations with spaces, social movements and cultural events at an increasingly authoritarian regime. The rise of authoritarianism also implied a transformation in my methodology. This thesis offers a timely contribution to the relationship between neoliberalism and Islamic fundamentalism while pointing to people’s political use of cultural spaces. It also offers new insights on the phenomenon of film festivals by relating them to urban cultures and social movements in their hosting cities. It expands our knowledge on non-Western audiences’ engagement with a film festival, whilst providing an interpretation of social movement development attached to cultural spaces such as film festivals. More broadly, it gives new insights on the film and protest culture of a secular group within a predominantly Muslim culture in showing the ways in which they oppose Islamic fundamentalism and neoliberalism. It situates the Emek movement and the Gezi uprising, not only in their close affinity with Istanbul’s cityscape and Turkey’s political situation but also in their organic relationship with global social movements particularly the Occupy movements and the Arab Spring. Thus, this thesis makes a unique interdisciplinary contribution to II the existing literature on film festivals as well as urban research and social movements.",1885881190,,Dissertations & Theses," Ozduzen, OzgeOzduzenOzgeOzduzen, Ozge",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321572583 , 105318512 , 101309 , 10590596 , 10590596 , http://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/8294/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1885881190?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/8294/ , (UMI)AAI10590596 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Film+festivals+and+social+movements+intertwined%3A+the+spatial+activism+of+the+istanbul+film+festival+audience+during+the+gezi+protests&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ozduzen%2C+Ozge&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"889,New social movements and social networking sites' uses: mexicans' mobilization for peace in mexico,"The recent political protests around the globe since the uprising in the Arab World, the Indignados movement in Spain, and the Occupy Movement in United States, were broadcast to the world through both the global mainstream and alternative media using many images and reports produced by people on the ground using internet, mobile phones, and social media. These events have triggered a discussion not only about the political changes taking place in the region but have also opened up an academic debate about what changes and transformations may have occurred in the nature of citizens' political actions and the use of social media to communicate with people around the world. In turn, these political events have also reignited the discussion on social media as transnational public spheres beyond government control and opened to question the ethos of existing attempts at Internet governance by western nation-states. The aim of this thesis is to engage in a theoretical discussion of this political phenomenon through a case study of New Social Movements and social networking sites' Uses: Mexicans' mobilization for peace in Mexico, an important element in the development of citizen participation on the Internet focused on in the thesis. In this process, this thesis examines how theoretically social movements have been transformed with the goal of contributing to the debate on the role of new communication technologies in redefining social movements and their potential to transform traditional political practices, such as opening up space to develop temporary alliances with the government, widening political participation in government structures, and/or exercising more influence on the policy-making process.",1885887432,,Dissertations & Theses," García González, L.

In order to explain this phenomenon it analyses the work of one of the movement’s most influential English-speaking ideologues, Anwar al-Awlaki. This will reveal how he “Westernised” global jihadist ideology so that it could be made more accessible to his audience. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate how Awlaki’s success in making the key tenets of global jihadist ideology accessible to Westerners impacted upon the radicalisation process of homegrown jihadists. In the first instance, this study will place Awlaki in the context of a decades-long effort by global jihadist strategists to create a social movement capable of appealing to audiences around the globe. In order for this strategy to succeed in the West, the movement required an effective interpreter and the thesis will show how Awlaki was able to fulfil this role by pursuing a number of processes related to social movement leadership. The subsequent analysis of Awlaki’s work will shed light on both his own radicalisation from non-violent Islamist to global jihadist and his later efforts to spread this violent ideology in the West. Following this, a number of individual cases of Western Muslim radicalisation will be analysed, showing how Awlaki influenced their decision-making process. This approach will allow the author to highlight the importance of an increased emphasis on the connection between extremist ideas and violent action, which it will be argued lies at the heart of homegrown jihadist radicalisation in the West.",1896110698,,Dissertations & Theses," Meleagrou-Hitchens, Alexander YannisMeleagrou-HitchensYannisAlexanderMeleagrou-Hitchens, Alexander Yannis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322234925 , 103780982 , 101309 , 10596070 , 10596070 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-global-jihad-movement-in-the-west(17eb637c-94f3-439c-9bd5-7f8c1ad448f9).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896110698?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-global-jihad-movement-in-the-west(17eb637c-94f3-439c-9bd5-7f8c1ad448f9).html , (UMI)AAI10596070 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+global+jihad+movement+in+the+west%3A+a+study+of+anwar+al-awlaki+and+his+followers+in+the+context+of+homegrown+radicalisation+and+the+global+jihadist+western+recruitment+strategy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meleagrou-Hitchens%2C+Alexander+Yannis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"891,"Conspiracy of peace: the cold war, the international peace movement, and the soviet peace campaign, 1946-1956","This thesis deals with the Soviet Union’s Peace Campaign during the first decade of the Cold War as it sought to establish the Iron Curtain. The thesis focuses on the primary institutions engaged in the Peace Campaign: the World Peace Council and the Soviet Peace Committee. Chapter 1 outlines the domestic and international context which fostered the peace movement (provisional title) and endeavours to construct a narrative of the political and social situation which the Soviet Union found itself in after World War II (as a superpower and an empire leading the Socialist Bloc) in order to put forward the argument that the motivations for undertaking the project of the 'peace movement', above all, were of an international-political nature, rather than of an internal and domestic nature. Chapter 2 starts off with the Soviet project of establishing an international peace movement, including firstly the World Peace Congress, which simultaneously convened in Paris and Prague, and then proceeds with the institutional, political and social development of the Campaign up to the dissolution of the Cominform in 1956. The task of this chapter is not merely to chronicle the history of the Soviet Peace Campaign, but to extract from the narrative underlying themes and organise them accordingly. Finally, Chapter 3 deals with internal Soviet Peace Campaign. The task here is to construct a historical account of the Soviet anti-war movement from 1949 to 1956 through the institutional history of the Soviet Peace Committee. Furthermore, the aim is to demonstrate the relationship between the Soviet Peace Committee and party and state institutions and its dependency on and implications for political decision-making processes within the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Finally, this chapter will also examine the role of the Soviet Peace Committee and its affiliated institutions in the advancement of Cold War propaganda through the media (i.e. press, journalism, etc.), literature (i.e. novels, poems, etc.), film and political art (i.e. posters, caricature, etc.).",1916426282,,Dissertations & Theses," Dobrenko, VladimirDobrenkoVladimirDobrenko, Vladimir",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4323142201 , 105317442 , 101309 , 10625775 , 10625775 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3479/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1916426282?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3479/ , (UMI)AAI10625775 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conspiracy+of+peace%3A+the+cold+war%2C+the+international+peace+movement%2C+and+the+soviet+peace+campaign%2C+1946-1956&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dobrenko%2C+Vladimir&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"
