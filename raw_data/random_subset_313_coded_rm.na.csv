Engaging audio and visual magnetic media, orthographies and literacy practices, and literary movements and texts, this study offers one broad, diverse composite of Hmong diasporic cultural practices. Homeland theorized as tebchaws, postliteracy and its ideologies, and the trope(s) of literary movement comprise the central arguments that emerge from the texts and their relevant social, historical, political, and cultural contexts. This analysis offers active and engaged frameworks for the contemplation of the contemporary moment of cultural production throughout the Hmong diaspora. Throughout this study, the cultural figure of the refugee is (re)considered, and its stigmas of perpetual victimhood and the necessity of patronage are stripped away. In their place, the cultural agency of the refugee is restored and refugeeism is retheorizedâ€”expanded and enlargedâ€”facilitating responsible and apt engagement of the cultural contributions and cultural creations of those global actors who are often relegated as props in the dramas of war, calamity, and human migration.",304512988,,Dissertations & Theses," Ogden, Mitchell PaulOgdenPaulMitchellOgden, Mitchell Paul", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594487731 , 40125381 , 66569 , 9780549751571 , 3323546 , 3323546", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304512988?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American literature , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Cultural production , Diaspora , Hmong , Literacy , Refugee , Utopia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Refugee+utopias%3A+%28Re%29theorizing+refugeeism+through+cultural+production+of+the+Hmong+diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ogden%2C+Mitchell+Paul&amp;isbn=9780549751571&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.783705896,0.99294028,1192,Left,(im)migration,Morrocan migration,Migratory trajectories: Moroccan borderlands and translocal imaginaries,"The creation of the E.U., a polymorphous political, economic and ideological space, has transformed and distended European statesâ€™ national borders. This Europeanization of national borders has made all E.U. borders equally appealing to migrants and refugees. Instead of dÃ©tente in movement and flow, E.U. borders became increasingly militarized and E.U. states increasingly securitarian in their approach to migration. One of the most problematic consequences of this state of affairs is the rise in irregular migration. Based on research conducted in Morocco in 2005-2007, this dissertation explores irregular migration as a set of organized and chaotic (creative, unexpected) actions. I understand migration as an act without a finite beginning or a finite end, fluid, non-linear. At the center of this act is desire â€”desire for something else, somewhere other. This desire takes root in the individual and social imaginary and often transforms into obsession. But the word obsessionâ€™ begs its grounding in what is partially its opposite: the banal, the quotidian, the culturally mechanical. The desire to migrate structures and permeates the everyday: it affects the perceived value of the work produced and profoundly transforms concepts of space and time. Further, it invades conversations, participates in radical changes in patriarchal, gendered relations and in relations with returning immigrants. I suggest that (irregular) migration is both structural and intensely individual. Irregular migration, a global phenomenon on the rise, unwanted by host and transit states, is shaped by blocks, indefinite stops, liminalities and barriers. This leads me to question theoretical approaches to migration as constituted of flow and movement. Consequently, I concentrate on the disjunctive and derivate spaces created by irregular migration. I also come to understand that there is no finite, polished understanding of irregular migration as migrant treks and trajectories both create and are created by structural and collateral conditions. A new phenomenon has appeared. A transit country to Europe for many migrants from Subsaharan Africa and, increasingly for the Middle East and the Subcontinent, Morocco has become a host country due to the sheer difficulty of border crossings. Many economic and political refugees have trekked, often on foot and for months on end, across vast No Manâ€™s Lands in the hope of reaching Europe. They may remain in transit for 5, 7 years. Morocco, an emitting country, has become an immigrant countryâ€”a fact both the Moroccan state and the Subsaharan Africans refuse to acknowledge. Finally, irregular migration has become an economic enterprise rooted in the individual and global imaginary and based on self-sacrifice. Though migration cannot be separated from larger socio-capitalist structures and necessities, I argue that it is also a daily practice, alive, both creative and nihilist. Basing my research in different regions and among different groups, I problematize the notion of â€˜typeâ€™ of migration and think through how different â€˜typesâ€™ are produced by cultural imaginaries and translocal lives.",304986137,,Dissertations & Theses," Alaoui, Oum-HaniAlaouiOum-HaniAlaoui, Oum-Hani", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1830105961 , 44005001 , 66569 , 9781109252774 , 3364525 , 3364525", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304986137?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Cultural anthropology , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Borders , Ethnography , Migration , Morocco , Stasis , Sub-Saharan Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migratory+trajectories%3A+Moroccan+borderlands+and+translocal+imaginaries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alaoui%2C+Oum-Hani&amp;isbn=9781109252774&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.368631684,0.990998455,2765,Left,(im)migration,immigrant-serving organizations in the Canadian welfare state,The role of immigrant-serving organizations in the Canadian welfare state: A case study,"Drawing upon an interdisciplinary body of literature this thesis investigates the role of immigrant serving organizations in the Canadian welfare state. Comparative literature on the voluntary sector, international perspectives on settlement services for immigrants, and state/minority relations in Canada are reviewed to illuminate salient research questions. A case study was undertaken guided by the following research questions: what is it that the organizations do, including both their service and nonservice functions; what is the impact of the organization on clients and other stakeholder groups; what is the agency's relationship with government, its primary funder; and lastly, what are the implications of the study for analyses of the welfare state? The key findings reveal that, in their service dimension, the organizations proffer a type of safety net of cultural, kinship, and linguistic resources for immigrants; increase immigrants' access to mainstream services; and through collective action, articulate needs and thereby extend the provisions of the welfare state to immigrants. In political terms the symbolic allocation of societal resources minority communities is realized. An examination of the agency's relationship with government representatives indicates that, within the constraints imposed by government funding, variables such as ideological affinity and bureaucratic professionalism contribute to positive relations. In so far as the welfare state is concerned, the mobilization by ethnoracial communities to extend welfare provisions highlights the role of social movements as agents of change in social policy.",304478168,,Dissertations & Theses," Holder, B.

This study draws attention to the social and structural barriers FTP migrants have and are still encountering within the milieu of immigration policy and practices from 1969 to 2003.Â  It particularly draws attention to FTP migrants' general settlement needs; raises doubts about current immigration selection policy based on the points system and recent immigration dispersal framework, and contributes in building knowledge regarding the effectiveness of both strategies. Although the focus of the study is on 'micro' level of analysis, a post-structuralist approach is applied to explore the wider 'macro' , and 'meso' (socio-cultural, economic and structural) factors that form the context of these experiences.Â  Layder's (1993) conceptualisation of research analysis is used to understand the underlying relationship between structure (i.e. 'social context' and 'institutional setting' ) and agency (i.e. 'situated activity ' and 'individual agency' ) influencing migrants' individual experiences. Data was collected through three fieldwork periods in the summers of 2001 to 2003. The sample comprises 42 semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with FTP migrants with professional qualifications, five with local service providers, and a further three with local stakeholders in London, Ontario.",301667985,,Dissertations & Theses," Rahbari, M.RahbariM.Rahbari, M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761114111 , 45192041 , 101309 , U233510 , U233510", Dissertation/Thesis,2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301667985?accountid=14496, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology,, 0624 Occupational psychology, Occupational psychology," DXN114403 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+marginalised+integration+accounts+of+foreign-trained+professional+migrants+in+Canada%3A+an+analysis+of+structural+and+institutional+barriers+to+integration&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rahbari%2C+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.328480333,0.960501428,1530,Left,(im)migration,Pakistani migration,The mobilities of first generation pakistani migrants in newcastle-upon-tyne,"Modern life is constantly being affected by increasing forms of mobility. These mobilities allow for people to carry out activities that form and maintain relationships and networks on a social and obligatory basis. Complex mobility systems have enabled greater movement for many at local, national and international levels. Migration theories have been influenced by the mobilities paradigm and have led to the creation of new terminology such as â€˜transnational migrantsâ€™. Both the needs of post-Second World War labour shortages and the political and economic climate of Pakistan (after partition in 1947) led to significant post-colonial Pakistani migration. This directed attention to life in the UK and resulted in and created new mobility dynamics. In terms of the research on which this thesis is based, face to face interviews took place, with a total of twenty eight interviewees that were carried out in two parts with the Pakistani diaspora living in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne who migrated up until the 1970â€™s. Evidence from the interviews supports the notion of the Pakistani diaspora holding on to its values and solidarity. Nevertheless a fluidity of identities has become the norm for this diasporic group and the concept of transnational citizenship has become a reality. Examples of social integration and identity formation are documented as are the political and health issues of main concern. Finally, the leisure and tourism activities have been analysed. A theme that is central to the group was health and as the natural ageing process sets in there are motility issues that affect their lifestyle significantly and health care needs. Network capital, mainly the telephone has therefore become more prominent in interviewees lives whereas social capital has reduced as a result of immobility. It is concluded that diverse mobilities have enabled the Pakistani diaspora links to be maintained locally, nationally and internationally as well as the religious requirements to be met.",1508818965,,Dissertations & Theses," Sattar, ZeibedaSattarZeibedaSattar, Zeibeda", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3251465701 , 86268602 , 101309 , U605714 , U605714 , http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/3529/", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1508818965?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0366 Geography , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Geography , Ethnic studies"," http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/3529/ , 573505 , Social sciences , England",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+mobilities+of+first+generation+pakistani+migrants+in+newcastle-upon-tyne&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sattar%2C+Zeibeda&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.379298668,0.960156507,3843,Left,(im)migration,Mexican migrants in Arizonan copper town,"Always a struggle: Mexican Americans in Miami, Arizona, 1909â€“1951","""Always a Struggle: Mexican Americans in Miami, Arizona, 1909-1951"" examines the Mexicano and Mexican American experience in a copper mining town located approximately ninety miles east of metropolitan Phoenix. Scholars have not examined this group's history in Miami, Arizona; this is the first study. Primary and secondary sources, as well as numerous oral history interviews, provide the evidence that supports the thesis that Mexicanos and Mexican Americans have always struggled to claim their rights as Americans in their copper town. Despite the racism, segregation and the discrimination they encountered from Euro-Americans in building their lives, Mexican Americans persevered and fought back to claim their rights as Americans and attained the American dream of success and education. In reconstructing this history, several themes emerge: ethnic relations; social, religious, and school segregation; the Great Depression and the repatriation movement; the rise of unionism and the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers' (IUMMSW) efforts to seek wage equality for its members; the leadership of working class Mexican Americans in the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Chapter #111; the Mexicano and Mexican Americans' alliance with African Americans to prevent the destruction and removal of their homes for the sake of development and tourist dollars; and, the rise of the third generation of Mexican Americans through education and sports. In Miami, Arizona, basketball became a symbol of the American dream of equality.

Background: â€˜Communityâ€™ as a concept has enduring theoretical and practical significance. Often discussed in terms of representing something lost yet recoverable, community has further relevance in understanding social change and continuity. Underpinning discourses of community, there is often a recurrent theme of loss and recovery which has utopian and nostalgic overtones and this permeates contemporary understandings of what community represents. This is also reflected by the Labour Governmentâ€™s appropriation of community as a panacea for social problems. Since the 1970s, migration to Spanish coastal resorts â€“ costas - has significantly increased and retired British migrants constitute a large proportion of such movement. The development of theories to facilitate understanding of these new â€˜transnationalâ€™ communities through lifestyle migration is a relatively new area of study and I aim to contribute to this. The idea that the absence of community is problematic combined with a romantic discourse relating to â€˜past agesâ€™- or â€˜nostalgiaâ€™ - warrants further exploration. Methods: Seventeen in-depth interviews were undertaken with a theoretically sampled group of women who had moved to the Costa Blanca from the UK. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a narrative approach. Findings: There are multiple forms of belonging to community. Representations of community are multi-dimensional, complex and overlapping in nature. Place continues to be salient, but belonging to places is now more complex as a result of transnationalism through lifestyle migration and increased global movement. Constructions of belonging to place are inextricably linked to networks and ethnicity. Conclusion: Nostalgic constructions of community can be understood as an antidote to modernity and nostalgia denotes the mourning of a lost time as well as a lost home or place. In times of rapid social change, when peopleâ€™s intimacy with the world â€“ represented as belonging to places, networks and ethnic group - is compromised, they seek to recreate it through nostalgia. Nostalgic constructions of belonging are key to how people give meaning to their lives. Different types of belonging are linked to community through a sense of nostalgic intimacy with the world. If intimacy with the world is compromised then nostalgia constructs and reflects belonging. In the absence of real intimacy or closeness, nostalgia is ignited through narrative and fills this gap. Nostalgia therefore, is a form of chronotope since it can be used to link time and space.",1779212407,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahmed, AnyaAhmedAnyaAhmed, Anya", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3974063951 , 102697252 , 101309 , 10018061 , 10018061 , http://usir.salford.ac.uk/28392/", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779212407?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://usir.salford.ac.uk/28392/ , (UMI)AAI10018061 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Home+and+away%3A+british+women%27s+narratives+of+community+in+spain&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Anya&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.035999431,0.943639862,2596,Left,(im)migration,the Chicano movement,The emergence of the Chicano movement: Underlying dynamic factors and contributing occurrences from the past,"This essay inventories key historical precedents responsible for the emergence of the Chicano movement in the United States after the Second World War.

A study of the dynamic factors over these four periods indicates (a) the Chicano movement emerged in response to historic difficulties experienced by Mexican-Americans and their ancestors, (b) these difficulties were often a result of national and international policies promulgated by the U.S. as well as racially sanctioned social policies advanced by the mainstream U.S. Anglo communities.",304239596,,Dissertations & Theses," Kressler, Harry WillyKresslerWillyHarryKressler, Harry Willy", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 743727531 , 31588581 , 66569 , 1378549 , 1378549", Dissertation/Thesis,1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304239596?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0938 Demographics , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0938 Demographics , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0938 Demographics , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0336 Latin American history , 0938 Demographics , 0337 American history , 0323 American studies"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Latin American history , Demographics , American history , American studies"," Social sciences , Mexican-Americans , Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+emergence+of+the+Chicano+movement%3A+Underlying+dynamic+factors+and+contributing+occurrences+from+the+past&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kressler%2C+Harry+Willy&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.850479251,0.931712922,3796,Left,(im)migration,social justice in Korean society for migrant workers,A model for humane ministry with migrant workers in Korea,"Globalization in the past few decades has integrated the world economy into a complex whole, and today the international movements of production, capital, information, technology, trade and labor across the national borders are creating one giant global economy.

Unfortunately, economic globalization has polarized the world into the wealthy and the poor. As a result, the poor countries are situated to continually witness the increase in poverty, the depression of economic growth, and the structural unemployment while the wealthy countries continue to be prosperous. In Asia, this global economic system raised the newly industrial countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Since 1960, these countries have accepted economic development policy with economic technology and capitals from the West earlier than other Asia's countries. These newly industrial countries have rapidly achieved a big success of economic development which is called â€˜Asian miracle.â€™ On the contrary, economic growth of these countries not only has created serious production and price competition with other competitor countries but also has brought a decrease in population caused by the trend of birth control. These phenomena caused a lack of workers for ""3-D type industry."" 1 Most employers running ""3-D type industry"" in these countries have been in need of hiring cheap workers in order to survive their businesses. This situation has brought in a huge mobility of cheap laborers from poor countries to seek work in the newly industrial countries. Since 1988, migrant workers from poor countries have increasingly entered Korea as the country started importing laborers. The increase of migrant workers in Korea results from both industrial owners' demand to carry out their businesses with a lower cost, and migrant workers' desire to look for jobs out of their homeland. Most of migrant workers in Korea work under unfair and inhumane treatments: frequently delayed salaries, enforced overtime work, unreasonably low wages, malignant violence, and abusive language at work place, etc. In addition, the workers suffer from unfavorable migrant policies, industrial disasters, or medical problems. They also live in cultural indifference and ethnic prejudice from Korean society. Now, the number of international migrant workers in Korea is about 400,000, and the Korean churches face a serious challenge to take care of migrant workers. This project focuses on advocating for the human rights of migrant workers in Korea to bring about social justice in Korean society for migrant workers as well as helping the church to do humane ministry working in cooperation with migrant workers. First, this study reviews the history of migrant workers in Korea and the Korean churches' ministry for and with migrant workers. Then, this study analyzes results found through historical research and the recent situation on issues of the church's ministry with migrant workers. Finally, this study seeks to explore biblical and theological foundations for an appropriated strategy for humane ministry with migrant workers. A claim is made here that the God of righteousness in the Old Testament that liberated the Israelites is the same God who will liberate migrant workers in today's Korean society. Such a theology of righteous God is complemented by the New Testament's God of love in Jesus Christ who is in favor of the oppressed people everywhere. Lastly, this project is to develop some programs that are designed as an educational and practical tool for church's ministry working with supporting agencies (individuals, public institutions, associations and private sectors) and migrant workers in Korea. This model for humane ministry builds up a new vision for the Korean churches in the twenty first century to carry out potential missionary work, and hopefully this model will help vitalize the Christian sense of call to do God's ministry for and with migrant workers.

Young Oromos in Toronto","This is a qualitative study examining complex micro and macro social processes of negotiating drastic shifts in identity, cohesion, and belonging in the context of refugee displacement. A community-based small sample of 18 self-identified research participants is selected from among young Oromos living in Toronto. While most were born in Ethiopia, some were born in Somalia but all came to Canada as refugees or as children reuniting with families who fled Ethiopia as refugees. Innovative methodology was designed to capture the fluidity and complexity of micro processes as they interplay with macro processes in the wider society. Rich qualitative data were generated through loosely structured conversations, telling stories, singing songs and chanting poems, as well as evocative exercises, group reflections, and debates. Participants met every week in four one-to-one and three small group weekly sessions for an average of seven weeks in two rounds. This process built up to a larger focus group debate at the end of the second round of weekly sessions. Six events of ethnographic activity participation were completed intermittently. Data were analyzed using critically interpretive approaches and strategies of critical reflexivity. Concepts and theories from across multiple disciplinary and ontological boundaries were critically engaged and an empirically grounded conceptual framework, dispersal-affinity , was developed through constant goings back and forth between the data and the literature. Dispersal signifies globalizing movements of expulsion and dispersion for refugees while affinity signifies localizing movements of yearning to relocate disrupted social ties. Dispersal-affinity depicts a constant dialogue between the past and the future, the global and the local, the conscious and the unconscious, as well as the individual and the collective. Findings indicate that identity and cohesion are simultaneous processes neither separable from nor reducible to each other and that these processes produce a sense of be-longing simultaneously. Furthermore, they indicate that these processes are directional movements where participants long away from spaces of perceived violence and oppression towards spaces of perceived healing and liberation. The implications of these findings for social work and social justice are discussed.",305067532,,Dissertations & Theses," Kumsa, Martha BorooKumsaBorooMarthaKumsa, Martha Boroo", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 813769681 , 19263021 , 66569 , 9780612945234 , 0612945235 , NQ94523 , NQ94523", Dissertation/Thesis,2004," 9780612945234 , 0612945235", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305067532?accountid=14496," 0452 Social work , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0452 Social work , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0452 Social work , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0452 Social work , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Social work , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cohesion , Glocalizing , Identity , Ontario , Oromos , Refugees , Toronto",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sieves+and+reeds%3A++Identity%2C+cohesion%2C+and+be-longing+in+a+glocalizing+space.++Young+Oromos+in+Toronto&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kumsa%2C+Martha+Boroo&amp;isbn=9780612945234&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.591050926,0.913359105,312,Left,(im)migration,"social and political movements, in which citizenship and related rights have become subject to contestation and redefinition",Trouble in our Fields: Health and Human Rights among Mexican and Caribbean Migrant Farm Workers in Canada,"For many years Canada has quietly rationalized importing temporary â€œlow-skilledâ€ migrant labour through managed migration programs to appease industries desiring cheap and flexible labour while avoiding extending citizenship rights to the workers. In an era of international human rights and global competitive markets, the Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) is often hailed as a â€œmodelâ€ and â€œwin-winâ€ solution to migration and labour dilemmas, providing employers with a healthy, just-intime labour force and workers with various protections such as local labour standards, health care, and compensation. Tracing migrant workersâ€™ lives between Jamaica, Mexico and Canada (with a focus on Ontarioâ€™s Niagara Region), this thesis assesses how their structural vulnerability as non-citizens effectively excludes them from many of the rights and norms otherwise expected in Canada. It analyzes how these exclusions are rationalized as permanent â€œexceptionsâ€ to the normal legal, social and political order, and how these infringements affect workersâ€™ lives, rights, and health. Employing critical medical anthropology, workersâ€™ health concerns are used as a lens through which to understand and explore the deeper â€œpathologies of powerâ€ and moral contradictions which underlie this system. Particular areas of focus include workersâ€™ occupational, sexual and reproductive, and mental and emotional health, as well as an assessment of their access to health care and compensation in Canada, Mexico and Jamaica. Working amidst perilous and demanding conditions, in communities where they remain socially and politically excluded, migrant workers in practice remain largely unprotected and their entitlements hard to secure, an enduring indictment of their exclusion from Canadaâ€™s â€œimagined community.â€ Yet the dynamics of this equation may be changing in light of the recent rise in social and political movements, in which citizenship and related rights have become subject to contestation and redefinition. In analyzing the various dynamics which underlie transnational migration, limit or extend migrantsâ€™ rights, and influence the health of migrants across borders, this thesis explores crucial relationships between these themes. Further work is needed to measure these ongoing changes, and to address the myriad health concerns of migrants as they live and work across national borders.",858860242,,Dissertations & Theses," McLaughlin, JanetMcLaughlinJanetMcLaughlin, Janet", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2304027121 , 59652301 , 66569 , 9780494713648 , NR71364 , NR71364", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858860242?accountid=14496," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health , 0629 Labor relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Forensic anthropology , Public health , Labor relations , Ethnic studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Caribbean , Farmworkers , Human rights , Mexican , Migrant workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trouble+in+our+Fields%3A+Health+and+Human+Rights+among+Mexican+and+Caribbean+Migrant+Farm+Workers+in+Canada&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McLaughlin%2C+Janet&amp;isbn=9780494713648&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.178786085,0.897900646,681,Left,(im)migration,Sanctuary Movement(s) of the 1980s ,Places of sanctuary: Religious revivalism and the politics of immigration in New Mexico,"This dissertation examines the overlapping dimensions of secular and religious sanctuary place making by comparing the faith-based Sanctuary Movement(s) of the 1980s with the rise of present-day local immigration policy activism in New Mexico and beyond. Placing immigrant rights activism alongside religious revivalism, I also examine how the contemporary immigrant rights movement intersects with RenovaciÃ³n CarismÃ¡tica , a transnational Catholic charismatic renewal movement that originated in Chihuahua, MÃ©xico, and is growing in popularity among Mexican immigrants in northern New Mexico and many other states in the Southwestern vicinity. Mexican migrants' participation in both movements cultivates ""communities of protection"" that blur the lines between sacred and secular spaces, while also crossing ideological boundaries that separate legislating from evangelizing and legality from theology. Bringing different sites and configurations of sanctuary place making together in a historically contingent and comparative analysis, this research illuminates how new religious and political subjectivities are made in a changing post-migration landscape. This dissertation contributes to studies of immigration, religion, and social movements incorporating both historical and ethnographic methods and analysis of diverse sets of data including archival materials, oral history interviews, and contemporary ethnography. The first part of this dissertation is historical and traces the life of New Mexico's controversial sanctuary state declaration as a political theology that produced unexpected social and legal effects. I use the document to reconstruct a history of the sanctuary movement in the tri-state region and to narrate the events that led up to the dramatic 1988 Sanctuary Trial that defined the movement in New Mexico. Connecting the Sanctuary Movement(s) of the past with contemporary local immigration policy activism, the second part of this study focuses on the work of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, the leading immigrant rights organization in the state. Illuminating the interactivity between the immigrant rights movement and RenovaciÃ³n CarismÃ¡tica in the 2011 legislative battle over immigrant drivers' licenses, I show how the document became a ""vibrant object,"" that materialized immigrants' local citizenship and legitimacy of presence. Finally, I uncover the transborder mobilities and secular and religious innovations of the charismatic movement through the migration experiences of a family of talented lay preachers and musicians from CuauhtÃ©moc, Chihuahua who brought borderlands charisma to Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Santa Fe and reignited the spirit of renewal.",1526488015,,Dissertations & Theses," Villarreal Garza, AmyVillarreal GarzaAmyVillarreal Garza, Amy", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3310607921 , 87744022 , 66569 , 9781303842535 , 3617120 , 3617120", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1526488015?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Ethnic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Immigration , Religion , Secularism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Places+of+sanctuary%3A+Religious+revivalism+and+the+politics+of+immigration+in+New+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Villarreal+Garza%2C+Amy&amp;isbn=9781303842535&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.578922128,0.973836723,1086,Left,(im)migration,masculinty and migration,Masculine dimensions: Migration and gender in francophone literature and culture,"Since the arrival on the literary scene of a number of celebrated women writers during the last thirty years gender has occupied a prominent position in Francophone Studies. Drawing upon this significant body of scholarship, this dissertation aims to show that new representations of gender and sexuality in African literature have not been limited to reinventions of femininity by women writers. I make this argument specifically through a study of the reformulations of gendered identity provoked by migratory movement and the unique migrant trajectories instigated by gender trouble. African masculinity in particular occupies a complex and dynamic position in relation to migration. While Western legislative action requires that African men conform legally to new found cultural norms, social rhetoric constructs the African migrant as a mutable, marginalized figure in Western society. I seek to understand how francophone African literature written during the last twenty years has responded to and re-imagined this binary of migration and masculinity, and to explore the implications such literary strategies have for writing, literature, migration, and identity. Setting forth a corpus composed of novels and autobiographical texts, I argue that in contrast to African writers of the 1950s and 1960s who propose a revalorization of African masculine authority and identity in the face of transnational displacement and disruption, contemporary authors embrace and intensify the problematization of masculinity that occurs through migration. In these texts the masculine body is hyper-eroticized, immigrants perform male drag, homosexuality threatens heterosexuality, and father figures become seducers. Individual chapters propose readings either of a single work or of related texts in light of specific aspects of African migrant experience â€“ the sexual objectification of the African man; social activism and community building; the return of the emigrant; civil war and refugee flows â€“ and their attendant issues of masculine corporeality, identity, and authority. In discussions informed by postcolonial theory, gender studies, histories of migrations, and concepts of transnationalism, I suggest that this recent literary tendency, by favoring complex, diverse portrayals of migrant masculinity over homogenous, consistent representations, offers startling new insights into Francophone identity, gendered relations, the French Republic, and transnational culture.",304491673,,Dissertations & Theses," Bryson, DevinBrysonDevinBryson, Devin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1675761431 , 42466181 , 66569 , 9781109009811 , 3345910 , 3345910", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304491673?accountid=14496," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies",," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies"," African literature , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African Studies , Culture , Francophone , Francophonie , French Studies , Gender , Masculinity , Migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Masculine+dimensions%3A+Migration+and+gender+in+francophone+literature+and+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bryson%2C+Devin&amp;isbn=9781109009811&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.405677027,0.962914523,2862,Mixed,(im)migration,Chinese and Mexican immigration to US; nativist resistance,"In the age of exclusion: Race, region and Chinese identity in the making of the Arizona -Sonora borderlands, 1863â€“1943","American experience and the Chicano/a experience have ignored the impact of Chinese exclusion laws on the lives of fronterizos . This study examines international immigration, economic development and American and Mexican nativism to demonstrate how Chinese exclusion laws formed ethnic identities and closed national borders between Arizona and Sonora. Blending disparate social histories and historiographical trajectories, this dissertation illuminates a more complex view of border culture, politics, and economics during a period of heightened nativism. Sources for this study include Mexican and American government documents, daily newspapers, population censuses, journals, diaries, oral histories and manuscript collections. At the conceptual level, â€œIn the Age of Exclusionâ€ elucidates three compelling social and economic processes that shaped the contours of citizenship, residential patterns, and ethnicity among Chinese borderlanders. As a precursor to exclusion politics, this dissertation makes clear the connection between the vision of American empire, nativism and the simultaneous movement to politically contain Native Americans. Enforcement of Chinese exclusion laws ignited already-tenuous race relations in the region stemming from violent struggles with Apache Indians. Secondly, this study argues that the enforcement of Chinese exclusion laws altered the social landscape of the borderlands by mandating its closure. Enforcing exclusion laws became an international matter of concern and the region between Arizona and Sonora became its loci of struggle and containment. Third, Chinese on both sides of the border created a politically and economically expedient ethnic space by which they defied and mediated American and Mexican nativism. This study advances new interpretative themes in the formation of ethnic identity along the Arizona-Sonora borderlands. I argue that southern Arizona Chinese, unlike most immigrants, did not initially Americanize. Rather, in the early years of exclusion, southern Arizona Chinese acculturated toward Mexican-ness. Likewise, the contours of Mexican cultural identity and citizenship transformed because of the enforcement of Chinese exclusion laws. Sonoran Chinese, once considered a crucial sector of norteÃ±o society, became a casualty of revolutionary economic nationalism at a time when mestizaje , not economic accomplishment, shifted the meaning of citizenship in Mexico. On the eve of the Mexican revolution, the closure of the border produced an expanding context for understanding the making of a transnational.

Why and how did Americans make the Ohio River the division between slavery and freedom? How did they accommodate this river that drew its life from northern and southern sources and divided two worlds? As the Civil War split the country, why did this borderland fail to break apart at the seam of freedom and slavery? The Ohio River was both a boundary and an artery of movement that united the region. The river encouraged the peopling of its valleys: each succession of settlers, Ohio Indians, French traders, and English colonists met at its banks, creating a border. When Americans seized this international borderland, they made the Ohio River the legislated boundary between slavery and freedom, but the movement generated by the river created ties that crossed the divide. By 1816 Americans established a border that separated slave states from free states, and a river that divided bound labor between slavery on the southern bank and servitude on the northern one. The Ohio River split the North from the South on a map, but at this periphery of slavery and freedom, these fundamental nineteenth century dichotomies behaved more like rivers than static ideals. The river linked borderland slavery with borderland free labor, as wage labor and chattel slavery became points on a capitalist continuum rather than mutually exclusive categories for black Americans. Enslaved and free African Americans found no refuge north of the river, and, south of the river, the slave trade expedited the flow of blacks to the Deep South. White Americans on both sides of the river found common cause by embracing the Ohio Riverâ€™s role in the movement of blacks out of the borderland. These conservative antislavery whites claimed the river gave the region social and economic coherence that outweighed the border. By the 1850s, politicians and residents defined the region as a borderland, denouncing threats of disunion offered by pro and antislavery radicals. Even the Civil War failed to split this borderland as the nation broke in two.",304963356,,Dissertations & Theses," Salafia, MatthewSalafiaMatthewSalafia, Matthew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2042683821 , 52337261 , 66569 , 9781109754278 , 3406909 , 3406909", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304963356?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Borderland , Fugitive slaves , Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio River , Slavery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Slavery%27s+borderland%3A+Freedom+and+bondage+along+the+Ohio+River%2C+1787-1851&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Salafia%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781109754278&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.534980247,0.976033679,3685,Left,abolitionism,anti-slavery society in Uk,"The geographies of global humanitarianism: the anti-slavery society and aborigines protection society, 1884-1933","This thesis considers the cultural and political geographies of British humanitarianism during the fifty years following the Berlin Conference of 1884-5, focussing on two societies which merged in 1909: the Anti-Slavery Society and the Aborigines Protection Society. This period in the history of the Societies has received relatively little scholarly attention. On the one hand, historians of anti-slavery have focussed overwhelmingly on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. On the other, scholars of modern human rights have concentrated their attention on the period following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This thesis aims not only to bridge this gap, but to bring thesis literatures â€” on anti-slavery and human rights â€” into productive dialogue. The thesis has three major themes. Firstly, it situates the two Societies within a wider 'humanitarian complex' that includes pan-Africanists, missionaries, feminists, social reformers and others, exploring the connections and the tensions between these groups. Secondly, it considers the imaginative geography of British humanitarian concern during the period under study, which involves both a global mapping of the humanitarian gaze and the discussion of the politics of representation. Thirdly, it examines the repertoire of practices which humanitarians developed in their campaigns to bring slavery and other humanitarian abuses to the attention of various different publics. The thesis is organised into seven chapters. Chapter 1 establishes the theoretical framework for the study, drawing especially on the work of Catherine Hall. Chapter 2 provides an historical context for British humanitarianism between 1884 and 1933. Chapter 3 considers the humanitarian complex. Chapter 4 examines the role of the journals published by the two Societies in bringing humanitarian issues to the fore. Chapter 5 investigates the models of empire imagined by British humanitarians. Chapter 6 provides an account of the celebrations organised by the humanitarian movement in 1933 to mark the centenary of the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. The thesis concludes by exploring the relationship between British humanitarianism in this period and its modern equivalent.",1797883691,,Dissertations & Theses," Mitcham, Roderick EllisMitchamEllisRoderickMitcham, Roderick Ellis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4094253131 , 102902202 , 101309 , U171657 , U171657", Dissertation/Thesis,2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1797883691?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," DXN069287 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+geographies+of+global+humanitarianism%3A+the+anti-slavery+society+and+aborigines+protection+society%2C+1884-1933&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mitcham%2C+Roderick+Ellis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.013703804,0.908192834,3603,Right,abolitionism,indirect contributions to the slave trande and the American abolitionist and revolutionary movements,"Toiling in the Empire: Labor in three Anglo-Atlantic ports, London, Philadelphia and Cape Coast Castle, 1750-1783","The importance of the slave trade to the eighteenth-century economic, social and political development of the Atlantic World is an area of great debate. One reason for the debate is that most studies of the slave trade have focused upon the trade's direct participants: the merchants, captains, sailors, slave intermediaries, company officials, plantation owners, overseers and drivers whose primary labor brought them into the trade. This study redirects this ongoing debate by focusing on the missing element of indirect participants. These were the ship builders, coopers, general laborers, porters, watermen, canoemen, tradesmen, manufacturers and others whose labor, while not a direct part of the trade, contributed to the trade. Through an examination of this indirect participation, especially that of laborers, this study reveals new dimensions of the slave trade, showing it to be more extensive than once thought and emphasizing the importance to the slave trade of areas where the actual presence and use of slaves was minimal or absent. Two examples are a London ship carpenter who constructed a vessel that one day carried African slaves from West Africa to the Americas and a textile manufacturer in India whose cloth was included in sortings traded for slaves. By examining the slave trade's indirect participants in London and Cape Coast Castle, this study reveals the large number of laborers whose toil contributed to the slave trade's success and profitability. This study also illustrates how the ability of the direct participants to utilize both unfree and wage labor systems was vital to the trade's success. An understanding of indirect participation strengthens the argument of Philip Curtin and others of the global, not just Atlantic, consequences of the slave trade. Finally, through a review of the secondary literature concerning labor in Philadelphia, this study demonstrates that, in the city where the American abolitionist and revolutionary movements gained great momentum, many of its laborers indirectly contributed to the success of the slave trade.",304527539,,Dissertations & Theses," Reese, Ty MichaelReeseMichaelTyReese, Ty Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 729802511 , 30387151 , 66569 , 9780599418301 , 0599418303 , 9940384 , 9940384", Dissertation/Thesis,1999," 9780599418301 , 0599418303", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304527539?accountid=14496," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history"," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history"," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history",," 0582 History , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0335 European history , 0328 Black history"," History , African history , American history , European history , Black history"," Social sciences , Cape Coast Castle , England , Ghana , Labor , London , Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Ports , Slave trade",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toiling+in+the+Empire%3A+Labor+in+three+Anglo-Atlantic+ports%2C+London%2C+Philadelphia+and+Cape+Coast+Castle%2C+1750-1783&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reese%2C+Ty+Michael&amp;isbn=9780599418301&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.620353938,0.986273974,1996,Left,alter-globalization,Jordanian resistance to free market (neoliberal) policy,"The impact of economic globalization on the national policies of developing countries: the case of the jordan's agricultural, information and communication technology and trade and investment policies","The main objective of this thesis is to provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of economic globalization (neoliberal ideology) on the Jordanian national policies pertaining to agriculture, information and communication technology, and trade and investment for the period from 1989 to 2004 from postmodern perspective. The central problem addressed in this thesis is the way economic globalization (neoliberal ideology) has dominated the thinking of Jordanian policy makers under the claim to recover from market failure and to achieve socio-economic development. Subsequent to this, another deterrent emerges. During preparation, formulation, and implementation of Jordanian policies in the said areas only the authority voice is heard, a situation justified by rationality and the national interest. In relation to this practice, we explored and investigated who were included and who were excluded, as well as, who were the winners and losers in the policy making process at all levels from macro (global) to intermediate (state) to micro (local institutions). This initially became apparent through the reorientation of Jordanian policy towards a free market ideology, then through the strategies of Structural Adjustments Programs (SAPs), Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), deregulations and the cut-down of social programs. The discourses surrounding the national policy have increased in complexity from one orientation towards the privatization of public enterprises, to another in the hope to build a strong economy. This has led to change the structure of power between different classes and has led to new social configurations. In turn we investigated and assessed the process of policy in terms of what, who, why and how? A Post-modern perspective which forms the methodological basis for this thesis is used to capture the complex relation between local and global. The traditional universality linear theories no longer give sufficient understanding of the complexity of policy analysis in an uncertain and dynamic disequilibrium world. The theoretical framework for our analytical critical theory synthesizes the modernism and postmodernism theories. Drawing from this premise, ""critical postmodern policy analysis"" has been introduced as the core element of this analysis. This study is concerned with the transformation of policy and how this transformation is guided by a discourse, consisting of arguments put forward by economists, policy makers, politicians and other experts. This is consistent with a Foucauldian framework. The thesis argues that each policy stage is varied in terms of its contexts, styles, participants and dispositions, and that each stage has unique cultural configurations. Therefore, three critical postmodern approaches were utilized namely: historiography, archaeology and governmentality to examine each policy context at all levels, over the policy trajectory from global to local. Policy historiography was coupled with the early stage of the influence of globalization; policy archaeology with the formation stage of policy development; and policy governmentality with the implementation stage to explore policy in practice. Various documents, in-depth interviews, unpublished files and researcher observation were utilized in order to assess the impact of economic globalization on the three investigated national policies guided by the three critical postmodern approaches: historiography, archaeology and governmentality. As revealed by historiography the neoliberal economic model makes Jordan's government unresponsive to its citizens. It is like hegemonic structure which constantly provides mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. As demonstrated by thesis, the market is far from being fair, and creating new social configurations over the times. The thesis revealed through archaeology that Jordanian bureaucrats, policy experts and public officials have dominated the context of policy text production by using some strategies such as dislocation, legislation, replacement and the leaking of rumors. On the other side the thesis pointed out through governmentality that policies contradict each other, because of different mentalities and different value systems. As revealed by the thesis the three ministries have been based on ad hoc practices rather than on planned strategic decisions. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture has gradually adopted neoliberal policy while the Ministries of Trade and Information Technology were more radical in this process. Governmentality is also revealed that domination, or what is called control at a distance by which policies are centralized in goals and decentralized in means prevailed in the three ministries. This thesis has the shed light on the Islamic discourses. This is an attempt to show how the Islamic movement, from a post modern perspective approach, influenced the collective social imagination of Jordanian people during the nineties of the past century and afterwards. The Islamic movement emerged as an end result support for needy people having been deserted and the adoption of neo-liberal policies by the Jordanian government. As a rule of thumb, postmodernism obviously emphasizes the role of ideology in shaping the configurations of people's thinking, perception and acts.",1795018517,,Dissertations & Theses," Al-Zoubi, Mohammad Orsan MuhseinAl-ZoubiOrsan MuhseinMohammadAl-Zoubi, Mohammad Orsan Muhsein", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4082672081 , 105323232 , 101309 , U511001 , U511001", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1795018517?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," 515496 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+economic+globalization+on+the+national+policies+of+developing+countries%3A+the+case+of+the+jordan%27s+agricultural%2C+information+and+communication+technology+and+trade+and+investment+policies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al-Zoubi%2C+Mohammad+Orsan+Muhsein&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.157505198,0.982331399,1443,Left,alter-globalization,socially conscious art in US and Mexico,"Portable Borders/Mythical Sites: Performance Art and Politics on the US &lt;i&gt;Frontera&lt;/i&gt;, 1968â€“Present","Artists working on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexican border have, since the 1970s Chicano movement, actively explored this charged site in generating socially conscious art projects. This border art, formerly seen as ""marginal,"" is explored in this dissertation as central to an interrogation of site-specificity and globalization â€“ particularly in the medium of performance art. Based on an analysis of artworks from four decades by artists such as David Avalos and the Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo, Guillermo GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a, Coco Fusco, Felipe Ehrenberg, and the collaborative team of Allora and Calzadilla, the dissertation claims that border artists both anticipated and responded to larger economic and social shifts, particularly the trade relations heralded by NAFTA in 1994. Site-specificity and performance became complex and sometimes contradictory tools that these artists used to make statements on the nature of economic and political relations between North and South, rich and poor, American and Mexican, citizen and immigrant. Art, rather than pure political action, is particularly equipped to encourage such exploration, as the indeterminacy of art (rather than the determinacy of political action) allows for the processes of social change. This line of inquiry can be extended to other border and transnational regions. Rethinking art and art history from its ""borders"" â€“ literal and metaphorical â€“ ultimately destabilizes traditional art historiographic narratives in a productive way.

Why were the social movements in the 2011 global wave of unrest so suddenly disruptive, even violent, almost always involving riots? What does this have to teach us about the rhetorical power of embodied, contentious rhetorics, and what does it tell us about the characteristics of movements to come? Social movements are faced with exigencies under neoliberalism to which they often respond differently than the large-scale demonstrations of previous eras: a) protesting counterpublics often make their appeals immediately and intensively rather than extensively through mass media, b) challenging the status quo more in terms of power (in its aspects of agency, capacity, and possibility) than in claims of justice, and c) often do so in part by performing antagonism with existing institutions of enforcement: namely, police. Nonviolence discourse is inconsistent with the rhetorical strategies best suited to these conditions, although in its ""strategic"" rather than ""principled"" variants, it shares more in common with them than is usually thought: strategies, social processes enacted, goals, and the aversion to inflicting injury to bodies. Rioting has proved central to recent movements because it is exemplary (though not exclusive) of how such strategies are enacted, and bears out in condensed form their logic: necessarily embodied and risky in the discursive action of transgressing previous semiotic systems, articulating new contentious subjects through physically confronting old foci of power. Like the more confrontational aspects of the Occupy movement, future movements are likely to perform power in similar ways, fostering a complementarity of diverse, innovative approaches, broaching semiotic expectations, and not relying on the categories of victimhood and innocence which have proven central to previous generations of social movement rhetoric.",1608992116,,Dissertations & Theses," Meckfessel, ShonMeckfesselShonMeckfessel, Shon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3453827091 , 90699362 , 66569 , 9781321110173 , 3631910 , 3631910", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1608992116?accountid=14496, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric, 0681 Rhetoric,, 0681 Rhetoric, Rhetoric," Language, literature and linguistics , Disruption , Neoliberalism , Nonviolence , Occupy , Riots , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contentious+Subjects%3A+Non%2Fviolence+as+Topic+and+Trope+in+the+Occupy+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meckfessel%2C+Shon&amp;isbn=9781321110173&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.561280661,0.974416771,1809,Left,alter-globalization,"post-60s utopias, Occupy, feminism, punk, anti-colonial",After the 'post-sixties': A cultural history of Utopia in the United States,"After the â€˜Post-Sixtiesâ€™: A Cultural History of Utopia in the United States is an historical inquiry into the cultures of utopian thought and practice. Consisting of three multi-chapter sections, this cultural history unfolds as an account of utopian, anti-utopian, and dystopian imagination through different periodizations. Each section attempts to extend Fredric Jamesonâ€™s 1984 essay â€œPeriodizing the 60sâ€ to a history of the present period, developing a historical framework for understanding the politics of utopia. The last section of this dissertation deals with utopia and dystopia as cultural tendencies in the historical imagination of the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the global explosion of social movements and uprisings that extended from the Movement of Squares in the North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of the Mediterranean, to the Occupy Wall Street encampments in the United States. The first section builds toward this account of the contemporary period, through a series of analyses of literature, film, subcultures, music, architectures, and historical phenomena that engage with communalist, feminist, punk, anti-colonial, and anti-capitalist articulations of â€˜utopia.â€™ The second section examines the recuperation of countercultural utopianism in post-1960s history of tech corporations and creative industries in the United States. In constructing a periodization of the end of the post-sixties, this cultural history considers various shifts and mutations in the political imaginary of neoliberalism, and takes up utopia as an epistemological problematic of contemporary global capitalism.

The Action Canada Network and free trade opposition in Canada, 1983â€“1993","Free trade opposition in Canada can be said to have emerged in the critiques of the Mulroney Government economic agenda in the early 1980s. It ended upon the ratification of NAFTA by the Chretien Government on December 2, 1993. The dissertation examines the experience of the major anti free trade forces in Canada during the debates around the Canada-US and North American Trade Agreements: the Action Canada Network, its international networking partner Common Frontiers, and Citizens Concerned About Free Trade. The primary question concerns the nature of a social movement. The Action Canada Network claimed to represent and to embody a national movement for economic and social change. It is therefore compared to a framework for social movements developed out of new social movement theories and international environment and development policy and politics. The central questions asked are, was the Network a social movement? Did the goals and strategies it pursued correspond to those of a social movement? How did internal perceptions of the role of the Network affect the success of its anti free trade campaigns? What legacy did it leave for Canadian social and political discourse and action at national and international levels? It is argued that the Network confused itself with the social movement it claimed to represent and therefore blocked the possibility of its emergence. As a result, despite the movement potential exhibited by the Network during the 1987â€“88 anti Free Trade Agreement campaign, when it can be said to have been the closest to truly constituting a national social movement, it failed to achieve its goals. The so-called Free Trade election of 1988 was lost, and the next round of NAFTA opposition saw a much lower rate of public participation and support for the Network platform, despite polls indicating Canadians blamed the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement for a poor economic outlook. Finally, it failed to influence a new era of social politics in Canada. Little public space exists today for a credible challenge to the neoconservative ideology which underlay the agreements and which prevails today.",304644028,,Dissertations & Theses," Huyer, SophiaHuyerSophiaHuyer, Sophia", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725889651 , 19253771 , 66569 , 9780612595446 , 0612595447 , NQ59544 , NQ59544", Dissertation/Thesis,2000," 9780612595446 , 0612595447", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304644028?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0334 Canadian history"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0334 Canadian history"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0334 Canadian history",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0334 Canadian history"," Political science , International law , International relations , Canadian history"," Social sciences , Action Canada Network , Free trade , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=What+is+a+social+movement%3F++The+Action+Canada+Network+and+free+trade+opposition+in+Canada%2C+1983%E2%80%931993&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huyer%2C+Sophia&amp;isbn=9780612595446&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.921572686,0.971046302,1315,Left,alter-globalization,Zapatismo (EZLN),"We are from before, yes, but we are new: Autonomy, territory, and the production of new subjects of self-government in Zapatismo","The 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico, created a rupture with a series of neoliberal policies implemented in Mexico and on a global scale over the last few decades of the 20th century. In a moment when alternatives to neoliberal global capitalism appeared to have disappeared from the world stage, the Zapatista Army for National Liberation (EZLN) initiated a movement and process that would have significance not only in Chiapas and for Mexico, but for many struggles and movements around the world that would come to identify with a kind of â€œalterÂ­globalizationâ€ project. This dissertation examines the historical moment of neoliberal globalization, what the EZLN calls the â€œFourth World War,â€ the Zapatista initiative to construct an alternative political project, and the importance of this process of rupture and construction for our understanding of social organization, political participation, struggle and subjectivity. Taking up theories of new forms of domination as dispersed forms of power operating through non-state institutions and a kind of participative subject in the public realm (following RaÃºl Zibechi and Stefano Harney), I argue that lines of antagonism can no longer be drawn between public and private, or state and non-state realms, but must be viewed as different strategies of subjectification, one as the subject-making of a form of governance, still but more subtly a form of domination, and one as a form of struggle for collective selfÂ­making. While both forms employ mechanisms and imaginaries of cooperation, the former cultivates subjective compatibility with an existing system while the latter I associate with the Zapatista concept and practice of autonomy. Drawing on several years of fieldwork in Chiapas as well as the extensive theoretical work of the Zapatistas themselves, I trace the development of Zapatista autonomy as a concept and exercise of power and in its implementation as a system of self-government and provision of services through the construction of autonomous territory. This use and understanding of power has been both encouraged by and enabling of the autonomous judicial, health, education, communication and production systems in Zapatista territory. My argument here is that, beyond control over land, services, and the mode of production, territorial and political autonomy has permitted the Zapatistas to create an entire system of â€œnewâ€ social relations, an ecology of practices that create a mutually constructive relationship between (autonomous) system and (self-determined) subject in a cycle that continually widens and deepens the scope of what is possible for both. I then turn to an investigation of the Zapatista initiative to create a larger political project, and a more extensive and diverse collective subject of struggle, through the launching of the â€œOther Campaignâ€ as a non-electoral antiÂ­capitalist movement. If governance as a new form of domination performs the function of interpellating individuals into, using Stefano Harneyâ€™s terms, a â€œclass with interestâ€ identifiable by its stakes in the system, I understand the Other Campaign to be a project to gather those â€œwithout interest,â€ often considered expendable or dangerous to the system or â€œsocietyâ€ in general, into a â€œclass beyond interest,â€ a selfÂ­determined community engaged in a struggle not for a moment of liberation to be won but as the construction of emancipation as a way of life.",845244544,,Dissertations & Theses," Kaufman, Mara CatherineKaufmanCatherineMaraKaufman, Mara Catherine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2242530561 , 51880341 , 66569 , 9781124401669 , 3433944 , 3433944", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,9.78E+12, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/845244544?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Autonomy , Globalization , Governance , Mexico , Territory , Zapatismo",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+are+from+before%2C+yes%2C+but+we+are+new%3A++Autonomy%2C+territory%2C+and+the+production+of+new+subjects+of+self-government+in+Zapatismo&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kaufman%2C+Mara+Catherine&amp;isbn=9781124401669&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.689847871,0.965966708,1461,Left,alter-globalization,artistic and literary responses to neoliberalism in AR and Central America,"Culture, Politics and Neoliberalism: New Subjectivities and Representation in Argentina and Central America, 1990sâ€“2000s","This dissertation is an interdisciplinary and comparative project that lies at the intersection of political economy and cultural production. Specifically, it explores the relationship between film and literature, and the consolidation and later crisis of neoliberalism as the dominant socio-economic system in Argentina and four countries of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) during the 1990s and early 2000s. The dissertation argues that the turn to neoliberalism implies a concurrent change in cultural production characterized by a shift in subjectivity, representation, and the relationship between politics and aesthetics, resulting in a reformulation of the critical possibilities of cultural texts in a historical moment characterized by a crisis of leftist political projects. As commodities within the global market themselves, cultural texts are able to unveil the contradictions, inequalities and tensions within neoliberalism, resisting its dominant logic, but at the same time appropriating and reformulating it in a variety of ways. By neoliberalism the dissertation means three things. First, a philosophy and theory of political economy that proposes individual wellbeing and national progress to be best advanced by an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. Second, a set of specific policies such as privatization and the elimination of tariffs on the movement of capital and goods implemented by national governments and international organizations with concrete material effects. Third, the specific form of the late capitalist system that seeks to establish itself as the dominant global economic logic, but also as the basis for social relations in general. The dissertation organizes its exploration of the relationship between neoliberalism and cultural production in Argentina and Central America through five specific â€œinterventionsâ€, each one exploring a distinct, but interrelated, theme. The first chapter, written under the theme of â€œMoneyâ€, focuses on Argentina, specifically on the repercussions of neoliberal policies tied to the 1991 Convertibility Law, which pegs the Argentine peso to the dollar and establishes a complete liberalization of financial transactions to and from the country. The chapter analyzes the novel Plata quemada (1997) by Ricardo Piglia and the film Nueve reinas (2000) by FabiÃ¡n Bielinsky as veiled critiques of the neoliberal 1990s, revealing through a critical association with criminality, the instability and inequality of a system that hides behind financial discourse, the actual reality of macroeconomic thievery. The second chapter focuses on postwar Central American fiction through the theme of â€œDisenchantment.â€ It consists of a critical exploration of the short novel El asco (1997) by Honduran/Salvadoran writer Horacio Castellanos Moya and the novel Managua, Salsa City (2000) by Nicaraguan/Guatemalan writer Franz Galich. The chapter challenges the characterization of these novels as pessimistic and cynical, arguing that they are in fact re-imagining the relation between politics and aesthetics in a new socioeconomic context. The third chapter, written under the theme of â€œTime,â€ concentrates on two films of the so-called New Argentine Cinema: La mujer sin cabeza (2008) by Lucrecia Martel and Bolivia (2001) by AdriÃ¡n Caetano. Although in distinct ways, the chapter argues that both films develop a sense of time in direct opposition to the â€œaccelerated timeâ€ commonly associated with global capitalism, thus challenging the imaginary of Argentina as urban, cosmopolitan and European through a temporal affective experience tied to those who are not integrated into the space-time of the global market. The fourth chapter, written in relation to the theme of â€œViolenceâ€, discusses the novel El material humano (2009) by Guatemalan writer Rodrigo Rey Rosa and the short story collection MediodÃ­a de frontera (2002) by Salvadoran writer Claudia HernÃ¡ndez in the context of a sharp rise in violence experienced by both countries during recent years. The chapter argues that partly due to this violence, and to a loss of faith in the neoliberal project as a whole, both works challenge the allegory as the dominant form of literary representation, searching for new paradigms of literary depiction. The fifth and final chapter, written under the theme of â€œAffectâ€, explores two contemporary Central American films: Agua frÃ­a de mar (2010) by Costarican director Paz FÃ¡brega and Gasolina (2008) by Guatemalan director Julio HernÃ¡ndez. The chapter argues that both films construct an ambiguous affective sensibility that captures the uncertainty of a historical moment characterized by crisis and change, in which the promises of social development and progress under a neoliberal agenda have been severely challenged, but in which there is still no foreseeable alternative, nor maybe even the belief in one.

This 'movement of movements' is uniquely positioned to battle the forces of global capital from its own 'fluid' territory, however, while protesters converge on the streets, ostensibly under the same collective identifier---anti-globalization---their interests are instead diverse, their goals multifaceted and their identities fluid, underscoring the complexity when attempting to represent this movement in mass media. Media's increasing concentration and orientation as a profit driven business poses particular challenges to a movement opposing capitalism. Media, as a site of resistance, a public sphere and as a tool of social change, is approached as a hegemonic and ideological apparatus that reflexively defends the status quo and chastises would-be challengers. By examining how this movement is subordinated through a frame analysis of media content, this thesis demonstrates one intervention into the role of media in the practice of dissent, and concludes that media's tendency to marginalize protesters suggests the need to reorient movement targets and focus on shifting policy and changing the state.",305368442,,Dissertations & Theses," Humphrey, MeganHumphreyMeganHumphrey, Megan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1083543441 , 32783541 , 66569 , 9780494118153 , 0494118156 , MR11815 , MR11815", Dissertation/Thesis,2005," 9780494118153 , 0494118156", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305368442?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media,, 0708 Mass media, Mass media," Communication and the arts , Florida , Washington",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framed%3A+Mainstream+media+coverage+of+anti-globalization+protesters+in+Seattle+and+Miami&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Humphrey%2C+Megan&amp;isbn=9780494118153&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.933403472,0.959851161,2922,Left,alter-globalization,global civil society,In search of global civil society: A critical exploration,"This study explores and critically examines the global civil society construct. In this period of economic globalization, there is tremendous optimism that non-state actors, such as transnational social movements, can take a leading role in representing the world's poor and marginalized to challenge the existing structures of oppression and exploitation. This study explores the diverse and contending meanings of global civil society, and argues against any attempts to advance a simplistic, uncritical adoption of the term. In contrast this study contends that the global civil society construct is fraught with ambiguity, contradictions, biases, gaps and euro-centric assumptions.

Based on accounts and analyses of feminist-autonomist militant practice and networks, this research project revolves around two terms: care and creativity. It maps out a historical-genealogical shift from a paradigm of creativity (reflected in neoliberal governance as well as in social movements of the decades before and after the millenium) to one oriented around care (reflected in the neo-communitarian policy as well as practices of commoning that arise with social and economic crisis in Europe). Structured into three broad sections on work, organisation and governance, the questions at stake here revolve around the possibilities and imaginaries of politics that affirm care and creativity in relation to one another. On the level of work, this means struggles within and against precarity, reproductive and illegalized work; on the level of organisation, it means relating the figure of the network to that of the care chain and the family, confronting new transnational forms of alliance and care; and on the level of governance, it is the relation between neoliberalism and its new communitarian forms that is in question. What the collectives, campaigns and networks constituting the â€˜fieldâ€™ of this research have in common is that they re-think the contemporary relations between autonomy and heteronomy, the global and the situated, as well as macro- and micropolitics. Dwelling on collective experiences and knowledges, this investigation takes care to articulate the dimensions of subjectivity, relation and association with those of economy and governance. Concerned and engaged with contexts of struggle and commoning in the face of crisis politics, precarity and dispersed sociality, a methodology of militant participatory-action research serves to map out contexts of practice in Spain, the UK and Argentina as of 2010-2013.",1788100594,,Dissertations & Theses," Zechner, ManuelaZechnerManuelaZechner, Manuela", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018947401 , 103733192 , 101309 , 10090487 , 10090487 , http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/9115", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788100594?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/9115 , (UMI)AAI10090487 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+world+we+desire+is+one+we+can+create+and+care+for+together&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zechner%2C+Manuela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.645973661,0.942881984,172,Left,alter-globalization,Transnational Repressive Apparatus (TRA) and resistance to global capitalism,Political repression and capitalist globalization: A theory of a Transnational Repressive Apparatus,"This dissertation argues that a central aspect of transnational capitalism in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the rise of a Transnational Repressive Apparatus (TRA) that limited the emergence of broad based and effective opposition movements in the global North. An application of Marxist state theory at the transnational level is made to theorize the TRA. The concept of the TRA builds upon the work of Robinson (2004) who argued that a Transnational Capitalist Class (TCC) has benefited from the emergence of a Transnational State (TNS) apparatus since the 1970s. Specifically, the concept of the TRA builds upon the notions of State Repressive Apparatus and Ideological Repressive Apparatus described by Althusser (1971) as well as the concepts of consensus and coercion offered by Gramsci (1971), and applies them to the transnational level. The TRA theorized here is made up of ideological, economic, legal, and policing/security pillars. The ideological and economic pillars serve to limit peoples' conceptions about the global political economy so that they accept the social relations of capitalism as natural. The force of the legal and policing/security pillars of the TRA greet those who pass through the first two pillars of the TRA into open opposition to transnational capitalism. Cosmopolitan theory, it is argued, in embracing global social democracy, fails to account for the repressive nature of cosmopolitan institutions and practices as exemplified in this account of the TRA. A Marxist view on the global political economy, which stresses the centrality of imperialism and primitive accumulation as TCC policy imperatives, allows for insight into the nature of capitalism and the requirement that political repression is a necessary feature of transnational capitalism in the current era. The Marxist view allows for an account of the TRA.",304411640,,Dissertations & Theses," Vaughn, Paul AnthonyVaughnAnthonyPaulVaughn, Paul Anthony", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1859936881 , 48536181 , 66569 , 9781109318258 , 3370648 , 3370648", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304411640?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure",," 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," International law , Social structure , Capitalism , Globalization , Politics"," Social sciences , Althusser, Louis , Capitalism , Capitalist class , Globalization , Marxism , Marxist theory , Political repression , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+repression+and+capitalist+globalization%3A+A+theory+of+a+Transnational+Repressive+Apparatus&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vaughn%2C+Paul+Anthony&amp;isbn=9781109318258&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.726122611,0.941896663,3253,Left,alter-globalization,the global justice movement,Mediating transgressions: The global justice movement and Canadian news media,"The focus of this thesis is the problematic, paradoxical relationship between the mass media and social movements. It is about how news media practices naturalize the hegemonic status quo, containing dissent and incorporating it into this ideological space. In Chapter 1, I lay out the theoretical framework upon which my analysis is based, examining the notion of the news media as a discursive battleground through the lenses of media studies, political economy, newsmaking theory, and Foucauldian theories of discourse and power. Chapter 2 begins with an exploration of the global justice movementâ€”its origins, its analysisâ€”as this context is imperative in conducting a critical discourse analysis. Drawing on print news media coverage of the movement, I then go on to explore how this movement is represented within mainstream Canadian newspapers, asking specifically how the â€˜war on terrorâ€™ has impacted this movement's access to this discursive battleground. Chapter 3 addresses one of the most contentious questions within the movementâ€”how does â€œsymbolic violenceâ€ (acts against property not people) get covered within news media, and, what are the effects of this?â€”analyzing whether the price of entry to this sphere is the re-presentation of events in such a way that smashed windows and graffiti are the only images portrayed, or, whether activists benefit from the space created by symbolic violence.

After an extended theoretical exposition of the expansion of the world capitalist system and the analysis of the Gramscian theory of the state and ideology, these two trends of thought are brought together to explain the organic crisis of peripheral states. The central working premiss of the thesis is that the domestic-international dichotomy is invalid and misleading to explanations of international relations, and that instead there is a continuum of activity which spreads from the local to the global environment. This continuum is expressed most consistently through ideology and class relations. Using Gramsci's theory of hegemony in the context of the development of El Salvador, particularly over the last two decades, the thesis seeks to demonstrate the strength and impact of such continuities. Any social theory must be capable of giving an account of change and transformation, and this is articulated in the concept of counter-hegemony (also developed from the work of Antonio Gramsci) and demonstrated through a study of the challenge of subaltern movements in El Salvador. The organic crisis of the state in El Salvador is interpreted as being of both structural economic derivation (location in the world economy, the nature of dependency, failure of domestic accumulation) and the inability to carry out a hegemonic project, these being consequences of the peripheral status.

This dissertation is a macro level study of the phenomenon of alternative video, based on the analysis of 72 organizations, accessed through documents and interviews with 42 representatives of organizations and leaders from around the world. The relationship between video technology and progressive social practices is theorized. The various concepts being used in the alternative video literature and their corresponding practices are defined and systematized. The development of the alternative video movement worldwide is described and analyzed. Appendices present a detailed listing of the different types of alternative video organizations studied, a systematization of the distinct practices which make up alternative video, and a listing of national, regional, and global alternative video organizations and organizational structures. This dissertation argues that video's potential to mediate time, if actualized, is key to the development of collective praxis. The concept of extended participation is advanced, and the concepts of video process and video product are redefined. Popular video and alternative video are theorized in relation to grassroots struggles, the opposition to mainstream commercial television, and the development of a social project against hegemony. It is argued that a global movement of alternative video is forming, and that this movement is standing at a crossroads between two strategies. The first is a participatory strategy based on uses of video articulated with grassroots struggles. The second is a mass video strategy based on video tactics seeking infiltration into existing structures of television. This dissertation recommends a third videotelevision strategy combining principles of popular participation with the widespread reach necessary for the development of an anti-hegemonic project of society. The dissertation concludes that the alternative video movement suggests the possibility of a global alternative to hegemonic global forces.",304259907,,Dissertations & Theses," Fontes, Carlos I.FontesI.CarlosFontes, Carlos I.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739487071 , 19511811 , 66569 , 9780591169881 , 0591169886 , 9709595 , 9709595", Dissertation/Thesis,1996," 9780591169881 , 0591169886", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304259907?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media, 0708 Mass media,, 0708 Mass media, Mass media," Communication and the arts , video technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Alternative+video+at+a+crossroads%3A+Towards+a+strategy+of+extended+participation&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fontes%2C+Carlos+I.&amp;isbn=9780591169881&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.231467772,0.911693415,2694,Left,alter-globalization,the Ogoni of Nigeria and the Zapatistas of Mexico,"The marketing of rebellion in global civil society: Political insurgencies, international media, and the growth of transnational support","This dissertation proposes and tests a theory explaining transnational support for political insurgencies from the developing world. Motivating the dissertation are gaps in the international relations, comparative politics, and political communications literatures concerning the origins of transnational alliances, the dynamics of transnational social movements, and the role of the international media in these phenomena. Further motivating the dissertation is an important empirical puzzle: Why have a few small-scale insurgencies in the developing world become objects of substantial and sustained attention from the world media and support from transnational NGOs, while most similar insurgencies remain mired in obscurity and isolation? To explain this puzzle, I analyze two highly successful cases of ""transnationalization,"" the Ogoni of Nigeria and the Zapatistas of Mexico. In both cases, local-level insurgencies in conflict with Third World states became international causes celebres--with important consequences in the insurgents' home states. To add theoretical rigor to my analysis, I compare these cases with the norm, international obscurity and isolation exemplified by closely-matched cases of failed transnationalization. The result is a detailed explanation for the empirical puzzle--and a new theory about the transnationalization of small-scale conflict in the developing world. The proposed theory is fundamentally political. Insurgencies from the developing world do not gain international prominence through such general background conditions as the ""CNN effect,"" through ""natural"" elevation of the neediest cases, or through random and irreducible processes. Instead, insurgencies gain international prominence through a two-step process: first, making a ""pitch"" to transnational actors, thereby raising awareness of the insurgency; and second demonstrating a ""match"" between their own goals and tactics and the interests and concerns of these actors, thereby providing a reason for support. To create a match, insurgents may strategically reframe their goals, conflicts, and identities to conform to the political goals and organizational imperatives of transnational NGOs and media. The latter entities act as ""global gatekeepers,"" selecting only a few insurgent groups for substantial support. Gatekeeper action in turn facilitates support from broader audiences including states and international organizations. The proposed theory substantially expands our knowledge of an emergent global civil society and should apply to a wide array of conflicts in the developing world--conflicts over ethnic, environmental, labor, human rights, and other issues. Moreover, while the theory is grounded in contemporary, transnational interactions, nothing prevents its application to historical cases or to purely domestic cases in which local insurgencies seek national support.

Using ethnographic content analysis. I examine the Global Justice (GJM), Antiwar (AWM), and Immigrant Rights movements (IRM) of the 2000s to offer a theoretical synthesis of the framing perspective in social movements and Gramscian hegemony, which I call the counter-hegemonic framing approach. This approach links the contested discursive practices of social movements to historically specific political-economic contexts to offer a macro framework to make sense of this meso-level activity that illuminates the development of a counter-hegemonic master frame. I apply this approach in case studies of each movement and a culminating incorporated comparison. In the GJM chapter, I found that the GJM frames neoliberal institutions such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund as influenced by corporate power. Second, the GJM amplifies the symptoms of neoliberal globalization such as global inequality and environmental degradation. Third, there is a master frame specific to neoliberalism which defines neoliberal globalization as a corporate project that seeks to reduce environmental, human rights, and labor regulations by eroding sovereignty in order to open markets and increase profits. For the AWM, I found that the movement integrated the context of both rollback and rollout neoliberalism into their framing to build opposition to the Afghan and Iraq War. In addition, following the corporate power frame of the GJM, the AWM problematizes the involvement of corporations in foreign policy discussions. For the IRM, I found that one of the central goals of their framing was to deflect blame away from undocumented immigrants. There are two ways the IRM accomplished this. First, the IRM emphasized the economic contributions of immigrants. Second, the IRM emphasized the impact of neoliberal globalization as a cause of increased immigration and social problems for which migrants were blamed. Finally, in an incorporated comparison of these case studies I found a distinct anti-neoliberal â€œrepertoire of interpretation,â€ which forms the basis of an anti-neoliberal master frame that emphasizes US hegemony, corporate power, economic inequality, and neoliberal rollout.",1734457409,,Dissertations & Theses," Hardnack, ChristopherHardnackChristopherHardnack, Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3870966721 , 98987112 , 66569 , 9781339171098 , 3730786 , 3730786", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734457409?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Globalization , Hegemony , Immigrant rights , Neoliberalism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framing+neoliberalism%3A+The+counter-hegemonic+framing+of+the+global+justice%2C+antiwar%2C+and+immigrant+rights+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hardnack%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781339171098&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.568723441,0.898198781,2980,Left,alter-globalization,anti-corporate globalization movement,"The dynamics of the coalitions in the anti-corporate globalization movement: A Massachusetts case study, 2000â€“2001","The past two decades have witnessed a marked increase in global economic integration led by neoliberal theories of economic development and corporate interests. Having broad reaching effects on all aspects of life, this globalization process has fueled the coalescence of a worldwide movement against such development. The groups attracted to the anti-corporate led globalization movement are diverse in interest, histories, social identities, and ideologies, and complex barriers exist to building a united movement for globalization from below. Identifying barriers and bridging these divides will be necessary to building strength and solidarity. Through researching anti-corporate globalization coalitions in Massachusetts, I identified several specific issues that act as barriers to forming a long-term coalition. I found that the major factors currently inhibiting the development of a sustainable coalition center on social identities (e.g. race, gender, class), limited resources, and the movements own priorities and time commitments. Herein, I conclude that for the movement to expand and build solidarity, the coalitions must address internal tensions and priorities, and evaluate how class, race, and gender dynamics shape their development.",304703405,,Dissertations & Theses," Gaudet, Jennifer L.GaudetL.JenniferGaudet, Jennifer L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1092132201 , 27223441 , 66569 , 9780542279003 , 0542279002 , 1428616 , 1428616", Dissertation/Thesis,2001," 9780542279003 , 0542279002", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304703405?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," 0700 Social structure , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," 0700 Social structure , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science",," 0700 Social structure , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," Social structure , American history , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+dynamics+of+the+coalitions+in+the+anti-corporate+globalization%0Amovement%3A++A+Massachusetts+case+study%2C+2000%E2%80%932001&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gaudet%2C+Jennifer+L.&amp;isbn=9780542279003&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.871926047,0.892772526,799,Left,alter-globalization,Asian Buddhist liberation movemen,Sacral socio-ecological community: Theories of contemporary social Catholicism and engaged Buddhism in complementary practice,"This dissertation provides a substantive study of the faith-based MondragÃ³n Cooperative Movement in Spain and the Indraâ€™s Net Life Community in Korea, analyzing and critically comparing the ethical values of Catholic Social Teaching and Socially Engaged Asian Buddhism. By evaluating the extent of their success in dealing with socioecological concerns, the importance of religio-ethical values and principles to the disciplines of social and environmental ethics is stressed, offering a new, religiously sensitive approach to ecological wellbeing. As this dissertation argues, the thought and work of MondragÃ³n and Indraâ€™s Net offer important resources for conceptualizing ecological ethics and social justice in and among human communities. This comparison considers two questions: First, what alternative economic system might engage, in context, socioecological religious values and be implemented as an alternative to neoclassical economics? Second, what socioecological ethical principles provide effective intellectual resources to critically assess todayâ€™s global economic and ecological crises, and suggest a way to resolve them? These questions are addressed by a study of the ethical and social implications of modern economic systems, as compared to a worker-owned cooperative movement and a socially engaged Asian Buddhist liberation movement, both of which offer an alternative to current economic configurations. Inspired by the communitarian personalist thought of MondragÃ³nâ€™s priest-founder, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Arizmendiarrieta, and the ecological thought of the Venerable ToboË‡p, based on Huayan Buddhismâ€™s philosophy of â€œinterdependent co-arisingâ€ (pratÄ«tyasamupÄda), these grassroots socio-ecological movements provide relevant, religion-based social and ecological teachings that present concrete proposals for economic and social practice.

International political economy is concerned with providing explanations for these changes. This thesis will provide an alternative view of international relations that is often marginalized in the mainstream literature. It will be argued that global society needs to be understood under the historical context of capitalism and the class relations that stem from it. Central to this argument is a Gramscian derived articulation of hegemony. Thus, hegemony will be conceptualized in this thesis as a transnational class that governs over global society through consent and coercion. While hegemony is usually understood as a dominant state or a collection of powerful states, the state-centric perspective that has persisted in international political economy will be rejected. Moreover, the driving force behind the reorientation of production, finance, institutions, ideas and social relations in recent decades is a transnational class movement of capitalism or what will be referred to in this thesis as neo-liberal hegemony. From this perspective, neo-liberal hegemony can be understood as a class configuration of productive forces, institutions, transnational firms, intellectuals, political elites and most importantly the role of ideas.",305087346,,Dissertations & Theses," Soller, JamesSollerJamesSoller, James", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1975266021 , 51053481 , 66569 , 9781109638455 , 1474415 , 1474415", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305087346?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Political science , International law"," Social sciences , Capitalism , Class , Globalization , Gramsci's theory , Hegemony , Washington consensus",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+perspective+of+global+capitalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soller%2C+James&amp;isbn=9781109638455&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.336700945,0.985722913,3141,Left,anarchism,Russian and Japanese revolutions; pan-Asianist tendencies,Cooperatist modernity: Anarchism and Japanese-Russian transintellectual relations in modern Japan,"In the 1870s and 1880s, the â€œRevolution in Asia,â€ as the Meiji Restoration was called in Russia, gave rise to numbers of Russian travelers to and accounts about Japan. They were eager to observe the emergence of a whole new kind of revolutionary society that departed from the French model. In the wake of failed revolutions across Europe, some hoped that Japan might serve as a model of a new kind of egalitarian and progressive society for a modern Russia. What differentiated Russian narratives of Japanese revolution from Western accounts was that they gave history to Japan, in interpreting that its â€œrevolutionâ€ marked the establishment of a cooperatist society as the result of domestic historical developments. This contrasted with the narratives that we have of Japanese development toward the capitalist community of nation states, a development indebted to Japan's encounter with the West. Increasingly, Russian and Japanese intellectuals developed contacts with one another through letters, travel and networking. This involved some of the leading intellectuals and cultural figures of the time, who sought to solidify cross-border ties with one another, even as their respective states were in diplomatic conflict and at war. In tracing the development of the particular revolutionary model that evolved out of Russian contacts with Restoration Japan, my work unveils the emergence of an independent modernity in Meiji-TaishÃ´ (1868â€“1926) Japan previously unknown to historians. It is a current that did not fit with existing paradigms in Japanese historiography of Western cultural hegemony and reactive nationalist and pan-Asianist tendencies during the Meiji-TaishÃ´ period. I provide a fresh conceptualization of nationwide social and intellectual movements of Tolstoyanism and Kropotkinism in Japan as modernist urges that sought to link Japan to the wider world through cooperatist principles of anarchism. These movements gave impetus and meaning to the revolutionary establishment of Arishima Mutual Aid Farm in Hokkaido by farmers following their liberation from tenancy, as a model for cooperatist modernity.

Hundreds of Cuban volunteersâ€”more than from any other Latin American countryâ€”traveled to Spain to fight for the Republic in both the International Brigades and the regular Republican forces, to provide medical care, and to serve in other support roles; children, women, and men back home worked together to raise substantial monetary and material aid for Spanish children during the war; and longstanding groups on the island including black associations, Freemasons, anarchists, and the Communist Party leveraged organizational and publishing resources to raise awareness, garner support, fund, and otherwise assist the cause. The dissertation studies Cuban antifascist individuals, campaigns, organizations, and networks operating transnationally to help the Spanish Republic, contextualizing these efforts in Cuba's internal struggles of the 1930s. It argues that both transnational solidarity and domestic concerns defined Cuban antifascism. First, Cubans confronting crises of democracy at home and in Spain believed fascism threatened them directly. Citing examples in Ethiopia, China, Europe, and Latin America, Cuban antifascistsâ€”like many othersâ€”feared a worldwide menace posed by fascism's spread. Second, despite their recent anticolonial struggle against Spain, Cubans cared deeply about its fate for reasons of personal, familial, and cultural affinity. They interpreted the Republic as a ""new"" Spain representative of liberation and the Nationalists as seeking return to the ""old"" Spain of colonial oppression. Third, pro-Republican Cubans defined antifascism in Cuban terms. People of many different backgrounds and views united around a definition of antifascism closely related to their shared domestic political goals: freedom from strongman governance, independence from neocolonial control, and attainment of economic and social justice. Radical, moderate, and even largely nonpolitical individuals and groups in Cuba found in antifascism and support for the Spanish Republic a rallying cry with broad appeal that allowed them to strengthen solidarity at home and abroad. Cubans defined antifascism in both negative and positive terms, as a movement against fascism but also toward unity, democracy, sovereignty, and justice.",1527009137,,Dissertations & Theses," Lambe, Ariel MaeLambeMaeArielLambe, Ariel Mae", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3311634471 , 87526922 , 66569 , 9781303842856 , 3617146 , 3617146", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1527009137?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Latin American history , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Antifascism , Cuba , Spanish civil war",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cuban+Antifascism+and+the+Spanish+Civil+War%3A+Transnational+Activism%2C+Networks%2C+and+Solidarity+in+the+1930s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lambe%2C+Ariel+Mae&amp;isbn=9781303842856&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.294003389,0.949613864,3421,Left,antifascism,"arlem Artists' Guild, and the American Artists' Congress Against War and Fascism","Artists respond to the Great Depression and the threat of Fascism: The New York Artists' Union and its magazine ""Art Front"" (1934-1937)","Art and politics could not avoid each other during the Great Depression and the rise of fascism, in the 1930s. Social realism, which had been limited to drawings in radical magazines or the graphic arts, became important in painting and sculpture. Artists in the John Reed Club, the Artists' Union, the Harlem Artists' Guild, and the American Artists' Congress Against War and Fascism drew a wide range of supporters and acted as pressure groups, influencing society. The New Deal's Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, which employed a total of 5,300 artists over a period of eight years and had a profound impact on American art, was started largely and continued by the pressure of artists and artists organizations. The Artists' Union, the official bargaining agent between government and the artist, negotiated wages, hours, and working conditions, and kept artists employed as artists, amid threats of closure, ""quality control,"" favoritism, racism, censorship, and selected layoffs. Between 1933-1938, at least three factors favored the artists: in a near crisis situation, the government was impelled to act on artists' solutions to solve their unemployment; the labor movement, aided by New Deal legislation, became insurgent, and provided a role model and support for artists; and all shades of the cultural liberal and left-wing--who would be totally disaffected from each other in the near future--worked together on common goals. Commonality was influenced by radical politics and an idealistic view of working-class--its solidarity, collectivity, and readiness to take action. Engage artists viewed the solving of artists problems in global terms, and with Popular Front ideas, worked with fraternal artists' organizations in Europe and Mexico. A window to this radical shift in artists' subject matter, patronage, and position in American society, is the unique art magazine Art Front. Challenging entrenched hierarchies in analytical writings, indignant drawings, and documentary photographs, it was vital and provocative, stemming from the realistic character of the Artists' Union, which sponsored it.",303931658,,Dissertations & Theses," Tyler, FrancineTylerFrancineTyler, Francine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746445401 , 31160551 , 66569 , 9124769 , 9124769", Dissertation/Thesis,1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303931658?accountid=14496," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history",," 0357 Fine Arts , 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," Fine Arts , American studies , American history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Artists+respond+to+the+Great+Depression+and+the+threat+of+Fascism%3A+The+New+York+Artists%27+Union+and+its+magazine+%22Art+Front%22+%281934-1937%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tyler%2C+Francine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.039349914,0.988094892,3458,Left,art/music/literature,folk revival in Finland,Changing soundscapes: music and identity in Finland.,"This thesis presents an ethnography of contemporary folk music in an urban and in a rural context in Finland. The focus is on processes of transmission through the implementation of education programmes, performance contexts, the interrelations and divisions between musical genres, and musicians' perceptions of musical continuity and change. One of the principal questions addressed concerns how people express identity through music. The ways in which folk music has drawn on, and incorporated, traditions from diverse sources, including other European folk traditions and 'world' music, are described in conjunction with showing how Finnish identity is continually reconstructed in relation to neighbouring countries, and more generally in the global context. It is argued that music not only reflects, but also shapes, patterns of social identity. In the first part of the thesis (chapters 1-3) the historical, cultural and social contexts in which contemporary folk music may be interpreted are examined. An outline of the historical background is provided, followed by a discussion of folk music research and concepts of folk music within the context of nineteenth century nationalism. An account of the folk revival movement of the 1960s, focusing on trends of folk music research, education programmes, and musicians' performances and recordings, which contributed to the emergence of 'new folk' music in the 1980s, leads to the second part of the thesis. The ethnographic material presented in the second part (chapters 4-6) was collected from an urban (Helsinki) and a rural (Kaustinen) context. The way in which regional identities are stressed when various folk music traditions meet in the urban setting is first examined. The discussion continues with an examination of the fluidity and multiplicity of concepts of identity, and the interrelations between regional, national, and international identities in the rural setting.",301527374,,Dissertations & Theses," Ramnarine, T.K.RamnarineT.K.Ramnarine, T.K.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757143631 , 44521851 , 101309 , U064558 , U064558", Dissertation/Thesis,1994,, English, English,,1994,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301527374?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music,, 0413 Music, Music," (UMI)AAIU064558 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Changing+soundscapes%3A+music+and+identity+in+Finland.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ramnarine%2C+T.K.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.993521201,0.975973063,2873,Left,art/music/literature,franco-creole literary ,CrÃ©olitÃ©: The anatomy of an Antillean literary movement,"Since the mid-1980s, the franco-creole literary and social movement of CrÃ©olitÃ©, based in the French West Indian island of Martinique, has been the subject of considerable European, and increasingly global, attention. For the most part, this attention has been on the part of literary critics. By contrast, in this dissertation, I undertake an anthropological study of the movement of CrÃ©olitÃ©. I describe and seek to contextualize both the cultural production of the CrÃ©olistesâ€”their attempt to carve out a niche for themselves, and impose their own authority on the franco-Antillean literary field, at the expense of their rivalsâ€”and of the written and especially oral reception of their work both by metropolitan journalists and literary critics and by fellow Antilleans. In doing so, I highlight various paradoxes of the movement, and especially the tension between the ostensible post-raciological ecumenism of their discourse and their own efforts to monopolize franco-Antillean literary capital, as well as occasional expressions of xenophobia, reflecting an underlying desire for ethnocultural purity. In conclusion, I relate this ethnography of the movement of CrÃ©olitÃ© to a wider anthropological project of studying intellectuals, their representations, and their ambiguous relationship to the societies from which they stem, and to which they aspire to speak.",304590290,,Dissertations & Theses," Taylor, Lucien GilesTaylorGilesLucienTaylor, Lucien Giles", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726306351 , 31605121 , 66569 , 9780493582061 , 0493582061 , 3044361 , 3044361", Dissertation/Thesis,2000," 9780493582061 , 0493582061", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304590290?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0360 Caribbean literature"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0360 Caribbean literature"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0360 Caribbean literature",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0360 Caribbean literature"," Cultural anthropology , Caribbean literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Antillean , Creolite , Cultural identity , Literary movement , Martinique , Postcolonialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cr%C3%A9olit%C3%A9%3A++The+anatomy+of+an+Antillean+literary+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Taylor%2C+Lucien+Giles&amp;isbn=9780493582061&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.261870217,0.97542171,3589,Left,art/music/literature,Soviet music policy,"The development of soviet music policy, 1932-41","The dissertation highlights the intersections between Soviet policy in other spheres and the treatment meted out to the musical profession: both the shift towards isolationism in Soviet foreign policy in late 1935-6 and the Stakhanovite campaign in industry with its accompanying emphasis on populism and anti-elitism can be seen as having had significant input into the anti-formalism campaign. It also focuses on the structure of the musical profession itself, and the ways in which practical concerns - the fact the state was effectively paying composers' wages - often played as significant a role as ideological factors in determining policy. What emerges as perhaps the most striking feature of this study is the absence of a coherent Party line on many issues, and the extent to which members of the musical profession themselves played a significant role in defining the boundaries within which they lived and worked.

It looks at a five year period, starting with the release of Suman Chattopadhyay's first cassette, Tomake thai, in 1992, commonly regarded as the starting point of the movement. The thesis argues that popular music is one of the ways in which different imaginations of collective and individual destinies and destinations are expressed, formulated and negotiated. Thus music becomes an important site of contests to establish hegemony, and to sustain specific power agendas. Working with the history of the region, the thesis illustrates how popular music in Calcutta and Bengal has thus been an important site for the cultural formulation of a 'modern Indian nation'. Investigating some emergent trends in new Indian music, the thesis also underlines some of the new ways communities are being imagined at a moment of the global market. The thesis highlights the role of media in these continuing processes of history, as a complex cultural phenomenon in itself, with its own links with a globalising modernity, and complex relations with the forces of the nation-state and the market. At the same time, the thesis cautions against assuming any binary oppositions between the 'nation' and the 'market'. Probing the contradictions and conflicts within a music which is often self confessedly 'anti-establishment', it also problematises any given notions of opposition' or 'resistance'. Finally, the thesis concludes that this study of a particular music movement in a 'postmodern' and increasingly 'globalised' world, does not reveal spontaneous fragmentations which make any kind of politics 'unimaginable'. On the contrary, we witness new trends and developments in an on-going struggle between different social groups and power formations, shaped and reshaped by both global and local processes of power.",301546831,,Dissertations & Theses," Chakravarty, R.ChakravartyR.Chakravarty, R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1758019331 , 44752091 , 101309 , U118656 , U118656", Dissertation/Thesis,1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301546831?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music,, 0413 Music, Music," (UMI)AAIU118656 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+global+and+the+local+in+the+post-colonial%3A+popular+music+in+Calcutta+%281992-1997%29+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chakravarty%2C+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.715964368,0.952233835,154,Left,art/music/literature,avant-garde book design,Early twentieth-century avant-garde book design: An agentive vehicle for social change,"The increasing dominance of visual communication puts pressure on professional communicators and students of rhetoric to understand the nature of the scopic regime and how competing ways of seeing affect communication networks and the societies they serve. This document focuses on the attempts of the early twentieth-century avant gardists to profoundly shift social realities by challenging the scopic regime of their time through book design. Their attempts to seize agency through aesthetics failed to directly enact a new social order, but the avant gardists succeeded in establishing the necessary visual grammars for new ways of visually presenting information, including the International Style. This current (and global) scopic regime embraces a particular relationship among text, image, and reader that allows us to cope with the cacophony of information and objects. To understand the International Style and other competing ways of visual communication, one must understand the major movement that came before: the Avant-Garde, which itself included movements we now call New Typography, Suprematist, and Constructivist. Principally building upon Richard Lanhamâ€™s assertion that we live in a â€œeconomy of attention,â€ Karlyn Kohrs Campbellâ€™s notion of agency as promiscuous, Anthony Giddensâ€™s work on the duality of social structures, and Martin Jayâ€™s conception of the scopic regime, this document traces the work of key avant-gardists and in so doing adumbrates how book design has combined and continues to combine aesthetics with social action.",193335663,,Dissertations & Theses," Proulx, Shannon KellyProulxKellyShannonProulx, Shannon Kelly", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1584070701 , 39689561 , 66569 , 9780549685852 , 1454648 , 1454648", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/193335663?accountid=14496," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0389 Design , 0389 Interior design , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Design , Interior design , Language , Rhetoric , Composition"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Avant-garde , Book design , Book studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Early+twentieth-century+avant-garde+book+design%3A+An+agentive+vehicle+for+social+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Proulx%2C+Shannon+Kelly&amp;isbn=9780549685852&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.661651111,0.951868784,119,Left,art/music/literature,Pan-Latin American subaltern solidarity,Imagining â€œel puebloâ€: Pan-Latin American subaltern solidarity and the music of &lt;i&gt;nueva canciÃ³n&lt;/i&gt;,"This thesis is an examination of the origin and diffusion of the Pan-Latin American song movement nueva canciÃ³n .

This discussion includes an analysis of the concatenated sense of aesthetics through which nueva canciÃ³n artists have attempted to simultaneously reflect their ""subaltern"" social and political solidarity at both the national and international levels.

This dissertation is divided into seven parts. The first part identifies the precursors out of which the avant-garde grew. This â€œhistoricalâ€ avant-garde period, 1945â€“1957, is seen as both contemporaneous with and departing from the bebop era. The chapter's by-line â€œthis music is climate controlled,â€ is a play on the historical uses of â€œhotâ€ and â€œcool,â€ terms that control the ethnic, racial, and social description of this music. The second part attempts to conceptualize a theory of African American musical avant-gardism using Renato Poggioli's classic theory in which he distinguishes four types of ideological and psychological motivation; activism, nihilism, antagonism, and agonism. Part three discusses the events and movements, especially the October Revolution in Jazz and the formation of the Jazz Composers Guild, that brought the catalysis of Black musical avant-gardism to fruition. The fourth part of the dissertation will focus on the art and experience of seven African American artists, George Russell, Yusef Lateef, Leo Smith, Bill Dixon, Marion Brown, Glenn Spearman, and William Parker through their recordings and privately published writings. Bill Dixon's work, particularly his collaboration with dancer Judith Dunn, will be considered separately in the fifth section as part of the philosophy and pedagogy of the interart inquiry into Black expressive arts. The aesthetics that characterize these and many other writers and artists and the naming of their music and their processes are not simply semantics or epistemological musings but cultural assessments by which one can know and represent an aesthetic past and, more specifically, question how disjunctures caused by musical change inform the historical moment in African American expressive forms. These artists, events and organizations are part of a larger discourse concerning jazz criticism considered in the sixth part of this dissertation. An initial circumscription, by various people and organizations that govern the jazz art world, is shown in which black artistic enterprise, experimentation and innovation were essentialized and explained away by the term avant-garde. This attempt to contain or narrowly limit the artistic range and activity of these artists has contributed over time to the excription of the African American vanguard from the construction of a jazz tradition. The final section of this work will consider how scores of African American artists have moved between two or more national spaces in order to continue to create and work since at least the mid-sixties. Between 1969 and 1981 over seventy-five record labels were established in Europe to document the new music. This creative process of transnational and transcultural dialogue between African American and European artists and other culture producers became a separate genre created in Europe under the banner of â€œcreative improvisational music.â€ This dissertation will relate how American artists transmitted this new music and how it was received by European musicians using mainly Dutch musicians and producers in the Netherlands in a model of musical transculturation.

It brings U.S. Latino/a and Latin American cultural production together in a hemispheric frame, examining art produced between 1998-2013 by artists in Argentina and Chicano/a and Mexican artists in the U.S. Through analyses of artworks and interviews with the artists, this dissertation posits a transnational generational formation of cultural producers aligned with leftist movements and ideologies -- specifically, those whose politics are anti-capitalist, anti-racist, anti-imperialist and/or decolonial. This generation and its artistic production is embedded in transformations brought about through neoliberalization, the influence of subaltern-popular movements organized in resistance to neoliberal and neocolonial forms of domination, as well as the decline of revolutionary nationalist paradigms that influenced the political formation of previous revolutionary generations. In addition to analyzing the myriad forms political art takes in the 21st century, this dissertation also uses politicized cultural production as a lens to consider aspects of counter-hegemonic struggles that easily fall outside representational frameworks within which these struggles are typically understood, including the way social movements participate in the production of subjectivity, these movementsâ€™ utopic dimensions, as well as the dissidence and dissent that attends popular struggles and their afterlives. The corpus of work examined in Art &amp; Politics Across the Americas includes activist street theater, counter-cartography, guerrilla interventions in public space, conceptual and site-specific art, counter-memorials, poetry, transmedia narrative and alternative reality gaming. This work is not only transdisciplinary; it is also extradisciplinary insofar as it passes beyond both the disciplinary limits and generic forms traditionally assigned to art and the aesthetic. This is seen in its integration of paradigms and methodologies from other fields (e.g. postcolonial historiography, direct action, solidarity economies), and in the ways that its means of production has led the art to function as an expressive element within broader social movements. The art and artists examined in this dissertation includes Buenos Aires-based collectives Grupo EtcÃ©tera... and Grupo de Arte Callejero (GAC); Los Angeles-based artists and writers Sesshu Foster, Ricardo A.

To begin, I introduce some of the basic tenets of the media ecology perspective, and provide a brief survey of some of its foundational thinkers. I interrogate how it can be effectively utilised for the purposes of art criticism, particularly in tandem with McLuhan's notion of the 'counter-environment', and in relation to music and musical multi-media in particular. I also give outline to the affect-script theory of Silvan Tomkins, demonstrating how others might use Tomkin's work in the decoding of musical communication. Part 1 - 'Ok Computer' and its Cultural Context. In part one I explore the 'concept album' and its application to Radiohead's work, along with Ok Computer's relation to the genre of science fiction. I provide background to what Neil Postman (1992) outlines as Technopoly, and begin my illustration of how Ok Computer functions as a counter-environment to the cultural conditions that Postman describes. Identifying him as 'Cosmic Man', I note that the album's protagonist alternates between the roles of the superhero and the anti-hero. In relation to the album's opening song 'Airbag', I explore Technopoly's connection to the 'War on Terror', commercial culture, corporate libertarianism, the global movement for change, and to the social and psychic impacts of the electric age. I also attend to Postman's proposition that television is inimical to democracy and literacy and that it is thereby abetting a new species of totalitarianism. In relation to the song's seventh track 'Fitter Happier', I describe Technopoly as it relates to 'globalisation'. Part 2 - 'Ok Computer' as Counter-Environment: the Anti-Hero. Part two explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man as the anti-hero, all of which associate him with invective feelings and violent activity. 'Paranoid Android' connects the phenomenon of information overload to Technopoly, and to its eclipsing of the traditional world-view. The song also portrays our protagonist's intolerance and scapegoating tendencies which I relate to the mimetic theory of RenÃ© Girard. In this connection, I investigate the character's contempt, simulated also in 'Exit Music (for a film)', whose allusions to the violence of Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet demonstrate how Cosmic Man provides a poor role model for the next generation, many of whom he would appear to be leading to suicide. Extrapolating the family feud to that within the global village â€“ as 'Airbag' suggests, I correlate Technopoly with what Dwight D. Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex; with recent U.S. estrangement; and with current planetary instability. Cosmic Man's antipathy continues to feature in 'Karma Police', a song in relation to which I discuss some of Technopoly's 'invisible technologies' as well as its association with contemporary strains on identity. These latter culminate in 'Climbing up the Walls' with his personal disintegration, which likewise reflects the unravelling of traditional American society. Part 3 - 'Ok Computer' as Counter-Environment: the Hero. Part three explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man in his heroic mode, beginning with 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', which highlights his estrangement from nature, and the unintended consequences of his technological extensions upon himself, his fellow species, and his habitat. Additionally, it explores his alienation from other people, from information, from truth, from meaningful life and from the humanity of his traditional past particularly as these relate to paranoia and active citizenship, the role of scientism in Technopoly, and to moral questions. 'Let Down' explores Technopoly's debilitating erosion of meta-narratives, as well as the phenomenon I identify as 'egalitarian let down'. Here I investigate Cosmic Man's scripting of happiness, particularly in relation to how Technopoly manifests itself in what has been identified as 'the medicalisation of unhappiness'. In 'Electioneering' I investigate Technoply's global economic and political inequality, and â€“ in association with 'No Surprises' â€“ I explore some of the varying techniques of members of the global movement, along with the aspects of Technopoly they most actively oppose. I also discuss the latter song in relation to television's 'disappearing of childhood', its 'diminution of adulthood', and their connection to Technopoly's general inflation of cheerfulness. Finally, I discuss the apocalypticism of 'Lucky' in relation to Radiohead's ongoing promotion of democratic individualism. Part 4 - Conclusion. While elucidating Technopoly's connection to the technology of money, I illustrate how Ok Computer's final song â€“ 'The Tourist' â€“ expresses Cosmic Man's self-critique at the individual and the cultural level. Probing the connections between literacy and the doctrine of 'non-violence', I evaluate the prospects for a type of 'secondary literacy', along with other potential positive or negative consequences of computer technology. Lastly, I investigate the issue of technology and morality in relation to what has become known as 'the precautionary principle'.

The PAAC presented concerts of new music from the Americas between 1928 and 1934 in New York City, Havana, and Europe. Purposeful diversity, or â€œcollective difference,â€ was the PAACâ€™s strategy for approaching European audiences by collaborative force. The principle of collective difference describes both the stylistic diversity present on PAAC concerts and also the ultimate goal of that diversity, which was to reverse the flow of musical culture from west to east. Through social and cultural research, style analysis, and reception history, I demonstrate collective difference in the combinations of primitivist, nationalist, modernist, and neo-classical tendencies present in the PAAC repertory. In doing so, I reevaluate accepted nationalist discourses in the Americas from a transnational perspective and demonstrate how Pan-American musical creation arose organically from interactions between Mexican, Cuban, and U.S. composers. In the final chapter I explain literary and musical connections between African Americans and Latin Americans during the late 1930s. Here I examine four Latin American art songs that participated in the international movement of negritude, or blackness, and incorporated elements of jazz and blues.

This work uses case studies of groups such as the Living Theatre, the San Francisco Diggers, and the Yippies to trace the development of a performative politics, an expanding repertoire of political action that draws upon the ideas of everyday life as performance. These groups of cultural workers (writers, actors, musicians, and performance artists) were remarkably successful at accomplishing a fundamental goal of political movements for social change: getting people's attention and getting them to act out. It was through the medium of culture that they transmitted, across both geographic and temporal boundaries, powerful ideas about the existence of, and potential for resistance to, hegemonic modes of thinking and action. Through demonstrating the significant influence of these ideas and ways of acting this work challenges existing narratives within the history of the time period. These narratives have dismissed the Counterculture as silly and superfluous, asserted the failure of the radical movements of the Sixties more broadly, and in doing so drawn upon overly simplistic distinctions between cultural and political actors and modes of action. It is only through the blurring of such boundaries, enabled by interdisciplinary modes of analysis including history, media studies, cultural theory, performance studies and studies of social movements, that we can see clearly the accomplishments of the time period. Acting Out begins by tracing ideas and techniques that would be central to the New Left and the Counterculture back into the 1950s. From key sociological and psychological experiments and works within the academy to the theatrical world of performance art, and most especially the work of the Living Theatre, we see the spreading recognition and articulation of the performance of every life. This idea was taken up and utilized by the San Francisco Diggers. Drawing on theatrical modes of performance, through actions that combined politics and performance art in setting such as Free Stores, the Diggers attempted to transform daily life through the power of everyday acts, and in doing so provided a powerful model of political action that further problematizes the distinction between the New Left and the Counterculture. These new forms of political action were simultaneously embraced and resisted by a New Left frustrated by the effectiveness of traditional modes of political organizing and engagement. The Diggers had a particular influence on Abbie Hoffman, a founding member of the New York-based Yippies, who expanded the theatre of engagement from the neighborhood to the national level. In actions such as the ""Happening at the Stock Exchange"", the Yippies used the tools of media representation to their own ends. The role of the media is further explored in the transnational influence of countercultural ideas, where the soon-to-be writers of OZ Magazine in Australia and members of the London Diggers took the moral panic reporting on the emerging counterculture as an inspiration for the creation of anarchic, hippie spaces and modes of engagement. Acting Out ends by considering the legacies of performative politics beyond what is traditionally seen as countercultural moment. From the science fiction works of former hippie William Gibson to the Situationist creations of music industry icon Tony Wilson, and finally the drawing upon of anarchist traditions in the recent Occupy Movement, we see the enduring influence of these ideas and modes of action.",1819650071,,Dissertations & Theses," Hannon, Andrew GreenHannonGreenAndrewHannon, Andrew Green", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4183132241 , 107799802 , 66569 , 9781369157505 , 10160855 , 10160855", Dissertation/Thesis,2016,9.78E+12, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819650071?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts"," American studies , American history , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Avant-Garde Theatre , Counterculture , Hippies , New Left , Post-War Avant-Garde",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Acting+Out%3A+Performative+Politics+in+the+Age+of+the+New+Left+and+the+Counterculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hannon%2C+Andrew+Green&amp;isbn=9781369157505&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.005484314,0.915785805,3144,Left,art/music/literature,international community of artists who have exchanged art through postal systems for 40 years,Clashing and converging: Effects of the Internet on the Correspondence Art Network,"This study examines the effects of the Internet on an international community of artists who have exchanged art through postal systems for 40 years. The methods of grounded theory are employed to collect and analyze three types of data. The sources of data are: literature collected from Internet communities where the artists converse and publish artworks, interviews with artists who have experience in both electronic and traditional network environments, and artworks made by artists to express their visual and poetic responses to the Internet. The collected data reveal three clusters of artists' concerns: social, artistic, and related to art history. With global electronic networks contributing toward technological change and aesthetic shifts in their art, artists express concerns about shifting structures in their social networks, as well as threats to their traditions and to the relics of their own history. Artists identify complex interrelationships and strategies that emerged during the 40-year history of the Correspondence Art Network that are in jeopardy of being replaced by new technologies and new forms of networking. The conclusions suggest future research in the fields of aesthetics, women artists, the archives of the correspondence art movement, and emerging networked art. Continued research into creative networked systems may help to protect the correspondence art archives, increase our understanding of a long-lived art movement, and highlight strategies for successful implementation of distributed communities across disciplines.",305295475,,Dissertations & Theses," Starbuck, Madelyn KimStarbuckKimMadelynStarbuck, Madelyn Kim", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765199671 , 30406441 , 66569 , 3116193 , 3116193", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305295475?accountid=14496," 0357 Fine Arts , 0723 Information Systems"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0723 Information Systems"," 0357 Fine Arts , 0723 Information Systems",," 0357 Fine Arts , 0723 Information Systems"," Fine Arts , Information Systems"," Communication and the arts , Correspondence Art Network , Internet , Mail art , Networked art",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Clashing+and+converging%3A++Effects+of+the+Internet+on+the+Correspondence+Art+Network&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Starbuck%2C+Madelyn+Kim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.244809409,0.914407353,1756,Left,art/music/literature,art intervention movement in Mexico,Los Grupos and the art of intervention in 1960s and 1970s Mexico,"Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Mexican artists employed art interventions in commercial galleries, cultural institutions, and city streets to facilitate a renegotiation of the role of art (and the artist) in society. The art intervention, a mode of conceptualism, served to circumvent traditional spaces for the display of art and to destabilize and expose the hierarchies or power structures that shaped the art world and society at large. Artists began to explore alternative definitions of the artist and the art object as early as 1961, when progenitors of conceptualism such as Mathias Goeritz, JosÃ© Luis Cuevas, and Alejandro Jodorowsky produced art interventions in galleries, theaters, art schools, museums, and public spaces. These new interventionist practices were forged within the context of local and global social revolutions. In Mexico, widespread repression and censorship at the hands of the state culminated in the 1968 student and workersâ€™ movements. Tragically marked by the government-initiated massacre of peaceful demonstrators in Tlatelolco, the movement accelerated incidents of protest, police and military brutality, and a crisis within cultural institutions. Though the Mexican government presented itself as aligned with socialist causes, the 1970s saw an unofficial dirty war launched against perceived radicals to quash the momentum activists had gained in 1968. This heated environment found artists in a continuing struggle to find new forms of expression as well as spaces for the display of their work. Many turned to collectivization and conceptualist tactics in what has come to be called the movimiento de los grupos or the â€œGroup Movementâ€ that flourished between 1973 and 1979. Despite the proliferation of art interventions across the two decades (and within similar socio-political conditions) connections between the 1960s generation and the Grupos of the 1970s have not been adequately addressed. Accordingly, this project examines the ways in which strategies of intervention served as a form of resistance for both generations. I argue that the intervention served as a primary tool in the renegotiation of the social role of art and the artist. As a vehicle of conceptualism, interventionist practice served to introduce institutional critique, new media and mass communication, as well as performative actions as artistic modes, irreversibly altering the cultural landscape of Mexico.",1727740409,,Dissertations & Theses," Decker, ArdenDeckerArdenDecker, Arden", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3849200831 , 93808842 , 66569 , 9781339147895 , 3729035 , 3729035", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1727740409?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," Latin American history , Art history , Latin American Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Conceptualisms , Intervention , Latin american art history , Los Grupos , Mexico , Performance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Los+Grupos+and+the+art+of+intervention+in+1960s+and+1970s+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Decker%2C+Arden&amp;isbn=9781339147895&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.72585944,0.913970797,2112,Left,art/music/literature,1960s Art &Technology movement,"The strange dance: ""9 Evenings: Theatre &amp;amp; Engineering"" as creative collaboration","This dissertation examines the historical case study of 9 Evenings: Theatre &amp; Engineering , a 1966 series of technology-based performances created collaboratively by avant-garde artists and Bell Labs engineers in New York City. The 9 Evenings project, part of the 1960s Art &amp; Technology movement, was a well-documented attempt to bridge C.P. Snowâ€™s iconic â€œTwo Culturesâ€ of science and art. It inspired the formation of an international networked organization of artists collaborating with engineers called Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.). Both the 9 Evenings artists and engineers were influenced by Cybernetics and other new ideas emerging from 20 th century science, and they saw the value of experimenting with new communications technologies as part of their respective collaborative practices. I argue that the 9 Evenings project helped pioneer creative collaboration as a key aspect of todayâ€™s digital culture that to date has not been sufficiently examined. I also argue that technology had, and increasingly has significant roles to play in the creative collaboration process, including as translator, or â€œboundary objectâ€ in an emerging â€œcollaboration aestheticâ€ that foregrounds dialogic processes and new knowledge rather than creating art objects. There is a review of a large body of historical and contemporary literature about mid-twentieth century art that includes original documents written by the 9 Evenings artists and engineers. There is an examination of recent writings about creative collaboration by business experts, social scientists, and arts scholars. Through case study methodology and research design, the artistsâ€™ and engineersâ€™ first-hand accounts are applied to a matrix of successful creative collaboration elements and to technologyâ€™s identified roles in collaboration. I conclude that as creative collaboration, the 9 Evenings project was both revolutionary and transformational. It was revolutionary for its intentional focus on dialogic processes utilizing technology as both tools and boundary objects to generate new knowledge, and it was transformational emotionally, intellectually and professionally for many, if not all of the artists and engineers.

Today Rastafari communities and dreadlocked inspired youth can be found throughout the Caribbean, parts of Central America and Brazil, North America, Europe and much of Africa as well as among the Maoris in New Zealand, some Native American groups in the US and many Japanese youth. Given its humble beginnings in the slums of West Kingston and the unfriendly climate and oppressive forces in which Rastafari was born and against which it continues to struggle, this growth and international exposure is truly remarkable. The primary catalyst and medium through which the movement has been globally spread has been reggae music. Through this process of internationalisation, Rastafari has lost its original territorial moorings and become a travelling culture (Clifford, 1992). However, although one can speak of the globalisation of Rastafari, one cannot speak of a monolithic, homogeneous or bounded Rastafari culture. Instead, Rastafari is continuously being appropriated and reinterpreted by different peoples in different ways, which has resulted in the emergence of new localised expressions of the movement. Although mainly found in English speaking and capitalist countries the movement has also emerged and developed in socialist and Spanish speaking Cuba. How Rastafari has entered the island, why and by whom it has been taken on as well as how it manifests itself locally is the focus of this thesis. In particular it looks at how Cubans have adopted and adapted the movement to their own context and individual circumstances and how in this process a myriad of new, cubanised Rasta expressions have emerged. Although there are a multiple of ways in which people identify themselves with and express Rastafari, the culture in Cuba is predominantly an Afro-Cuban youth movement. The reasons, significance and potential implications of this have a lot to do with Cuba's current economic crisis and the intense social transformations this is causing.",301594740,,Dissertations & Theses," Hansing, KatrinHansingKatrinHansing, Katrin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1759824271 , 44909211 , 101309 , U155972 , U155972", Dissertation/Thesis,2002,, English, English,,2002,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301594740?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," (UMI)AAIU155972 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rasta%2C+race+and+revolution%3A+the+emergence+and+development+of+the+rastafari+movement+in+socialist+cuba&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hansing%2C+Katrin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.200698413,0.90613192,548,Left,art/music/literature,"the Hare Krishna movement,","""Every word is a song, every step is a dance"": Participation, agency, and the expression of communal bliss in Hare Krishna festival kirtan","The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement, offers a highly accessible approach to Indian spirituality in contemporary American culture. Among the most intriguing facets of Hare Krishna practice are the prevalence of celebration and the use of activities such as singing, dancing, and feasting as expressions of faith. The dominant musical practice of the Hare Krishna movement is kirtan , the call-and-response performance of sacred devotional chants. According to Hare Krishna belief, kirtan can be a vehicle to spiritual realization and communion with the divine. In the context of public celebration, kirtan may also serve as a performance of the bliss promised by Krishna philosophy and an invitation to listeners to take part. This dissertation examines kirtan as a tool in the mediation of social encounters by considering elements of devotion, participation, and agency in musical performances at four festivals: two Rath Yatra parades in New York City and Los Angeles that take the practices of Krishna worship into public spaces; the Festival of the Holy Name in Alachua, Florida, which involves deep immersion in the process of singing kirtan; and the Festival of Colors in Spanish Fork, Utah, during which a large crowd consisting almost entirely of those not affiliated with the Krishna movement nevertheless gathers to participate in a weekend of Krishna-oriented musicking. I posit that the participatory nature of kirtan as performed in a celebratory context serves to negotiate issues of personal and social identity both within the Krishna movement and in encounters with those outside of it. I further argue that kirtan has the potential to create experiences that are perceived as being personally and spiritually meaningful not only to adherents to Krishna consciousness, but to those who ascribe to differing belief systems but nevertheless find elements of common spiritual experience within the kirtan process.",1287120561,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, SaraBrownSaraBrown, Sara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2890679641 , 71279232 , 66569 , 9781267885777 , 3551113 , 3551113", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1287120561?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0413 Music"," Religion , American studies , Music"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Communal bliss , Devotional music , Festivals , Hare Krishna , Kirtan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Every+word+is+a+song%2C+every+step+is+a+dance%22%3A+Participation%2C+agency%2C+and+the+expression+of+communal+bliss+in+Hare+Krishna+festival+kirtan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Sara&amp;isbn=9781267885777&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.542691366,0.898902471,3250,Left,art/music/literature,movimiento de hip hop cubano (the Cuban hip hop movement) ,"Los raperos: Rap, race, and social transformation in contemporary Cuba","This dissertation explores the emergent movimiento de hip hop cubano (the Cuban hip hop movement) as a critical site to examine the interplay of race and social transformation in contemporary Cuba. Following Cuba's post-1990 economic crisis know as the â€œspecial period,â€ the ethnographic investigation centers on the ways young Afro-Cubans are utilizing the expressive cultural space of rap music and broader hip hop â€œcultureâ€ to performatively fashion new kinds of transnationally engaged black identity and related race-based social critique. The author suggest that through such transnationally informed identity processes a new generation of Afro-Cuban youth are positioning themselves in strategic response to the shifting dynamics of race and class in a socialist Cuba increasingly shaped by the interpenetration of global capital and related free-market transformations. In a post-â€œutopianâ€ Cuba characterized by economic dollarization, expanding tourism, rising social stratification, andâ€”significantlyâ€”resurgent levels of racial inequality, the author's analysis seeks to understand how these emergent subjectivities and the social critiques they invoke pose challenges to, as well as contribute to a current reconfiguring of nationally-bounded constructions of race and corresponding ideologies of national non-racialism. He additionally draws attention to the evolving negotiated relationship between Cuban hip hop as a new, potentially oppositional identity-based social phenomenon, and the Cuban state as it attempts to institutionalize hip hop within a prescriptive, socially homogenizing frame of revolutionary national culture. In turn, Cuban rap has come to occupy a unique site of racially-positioned critique within revolutionary Cuba, serving as a key actor in an evolving black public sphere predicated on the assertion of black political difference within a previously configured non-racial Cuban national imaginary. The author proposes that Cuban hip hop in this capacity represents a critical manifestation of, as well as an active social agent within the shifting transnational complexities of national racial formation in Cuba today.",305125131,,Dissertations & Theses," Perry, Marc DavidPerryDavidMarcPerry, Marc David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 813773261 , 32096801 , 66569 , 9780496109883 , 049610988X , 3150711 , 3150711", Dissertation/Thesis,2004," 9780496109883 , 049610988X", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305125131?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Cuba , Hip-hop , Race , Rap , Social transformation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Los+raperos%3A+Rap%2C+race%2C+and+social+transformation+in+contemporary+Cuba&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perry%2C+Marc+David&amp;isbn=9780496109883&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.817000866,0.996771125,447,Left,art/music/literature,African Renaissance,Globalizing Kenyan culture: &lt;i&gt;Jua kali&lt;/i&gt; and the transformation of contemporary Kenyan art: 1960â€“2010,"In an age of globalization, when as a result of enhanced telecommunication and global media, the worldâ€˜s population is more interconnected than ever, the public at large still tends to associate Africa with poverty, disease and political instability. Yet keen observers of the social landscape have observed that despite Africaâ€˜s legacy of woes, cultural productivity in the region is on the rise, leading scholars to refer to the phenomenon as an African Renaissance. This is particularly the case in Kenya where a contemporary art movement is flourishing through both local and global art networks. But the question remains: how in the midst of poverty and political instability can there be so much cultural productivity? Based on field research involving participant observation and interviews with more than 200 artists and cultural workers in Kenyaâ€˜s capital city, I argue that it is due largely to an 'emergent cultural practiceâ€˜ given the Kiswahili term jua kali. By virtue of jua kali artists 'making doâ€˜ with minimal resources and maximum ingenuity, imagination, originality and entrepreneurial acumen, they are creating new art forms or bricolage, the clearest evidence of which is what Kenyan artists call 'junk artâ€˜; which is made from global garbage garnered from dump sites, then recycled into original artworks, and finally shown/sold in local and transnational art markets, thus reflecting global flows. This genre of contemporary Kenyan art defies stereotypical myths of ""tribal art"" and ""the primitive other.""

The study performs a close analysis of local-global styles of dancing and moving to understand how bodies reflect and produce larger processes of cultural change, and by comparing moving, reflective bodies in India today with older dance forms, traditions, post-colonial ideologies, political and psychological issues of nationalism and identity, global trends in beauty and bodies, economic and political structures of the visual culture industry in India, and other processes of globalization.

This includes an analysis of the exercise of patriarchal structures in the country including histories of nationalism and changing gender roles, the acts of compliance, resistance and indeed production enacted by bodies that constantly re-constitute themselves, ideologies that define the political-erotics of bodies, artistic/performative traditions in India, and emergent body movements and lifestyles that create possibilities for difference. The study also looks briefly at relationships and interactions between the country and its diasporic populations. It utilizes semiotic analyses of dancing bodies in filmic texts, including dances from Bollywood, diasporic cinema and music television, material from films, advertising and music videos, as well as analysis of live dances. The study suggests a theorization of the place and function of dance and dancing bodies in creating change, in re-defining gender, national and diasporic identity, in producing filmic pleasure for audiences, and in shaping, reflecting and creating ideological change for populations in flux.",304877143,,Dissertations & Theses," Nijhawan, AmitaNijhawanAmitaNijhawan, Amita", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1375514901 , 37473901 , 66569 , 9780549089919 , 3270451 , 3270451", Dissertation/Thesis,2007,9.78E+12, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304877143?accountid=14496," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures",," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures"," Dance , Motion pictures"," Communication and the arts , Bike races , Bikinis , Bollywood , Dancing , Diaspora , Globalization , India , Visual culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+are+cool+now%E2%80%A6in+Hamara+India%3A%0A+Bikinis%2C+bike+races+and+dancing+bodies+in+the+%E2%80%9Cage+of+globalization%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nijhawan%2C+Amita&amp;isbn=9780549089919&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.300241733,0.95023184,3547,Mixed,art/music/literature,abstract art movement in recent Korean art history; ambivalent towardmodernization,"Presentation, modernism, and post-colonialism: Korean Informel and the reception of the West","This dissertation discusses Informel, the most significant abstract art movement in recent Korean art history, which flourished from 1957 to 1965. In spite of the fact that modern Western oil painting had been introduced to Korea in 1910, Informel was the fist self-consciously avant-garde movement in the nation's history. As the first major cultural product in postwar Korea, Informel embodies the transformation of the society, in particular a desire for modernization and modernity, formed and led by intellectuals and the young social elite. The discourse of modernization accompanied expanded ideals on Western elements such as democracy, freedom, individualism, and enlightenment. Korean Informel began to emerge in the third Hyundai Artists Association exhibition--the group consisted of young artists who aimed to breach the conventional way of art-making and to challenge a dominant style, the Japanese-mediated French Impressionism. Informel works represent the drip technique, large scale, violent gesture, rough brushwork, strong color and abstract style. Most of the Hyundai artists suggested that behind these formal similarities with those of Western examples lay Korea's frustration with authority and its people's anger after the brutal Korean War. However, from 1960, Korean artists actively developed their own individual style rediscovering Korean traditional art. Hyundai artists branched out and developed diverse abstract styles. The artists including Seo-bo Park, Myung-no Youn, Sang-hwa Chung, and Chang-sup Chung, commanded very dark and rough surfaces built up with mixed media such as plaster and other materials. While Tschang-yeul Kim, Sung-soon Chang, Chang-kwon Kim and other young fellow artists adopted a simpler composition with calligraphic lines. And all of these artists explored traditional Asian visual features with Korean sensibility. For example, techniques of traditional Korean painting, such as using ink of various tones with abstract surface structure and contrasts between positive and negative space with absolute tranquility, were combined in Informel style. Informel was the most successful example of internalizing the Western avant-garde art incorporating the indigenous dialogue of Korea. Informel, diversified and expanded into various media and artists, signified the abstract style in general and caused a further exploration of other Western avant-garde styles. Informel artists actively participated in the international art fairs such as the Paris and Sao Paolo biennales, and this enhanced their status in Korea. The Korean art world turned its focus to abstract style and since then, the recognition and practice of avant-garde became the most significant subject among the artists. Informel was developed intertwined with the social discourse of modernization; intellectuals proclaimed the Western examples of philosophy and their systems of production. In this discourse, the desire to change conflicted with their identity, but as the subject of the change, Koreans took a critical position to both the realms of tradition and the West. As Homi Bhabha discusses, Korean modernization crystallizes the ambiguous stage of identity and an active involvement of mimicry. Informel, symbolizing the imperative to modernize the Korean art world that forebodes the advent of broad reception of the West, represents this ambivalent situation of involvement in the discourse of modernism.

After discussing Western interpretation and understanding of Islamic art, a brief comparative study is made of Islamic and Western aesthetics which includes differences and similarities between the two perceptions. The art of calligraphy is traced and evaluated and shown to be the only one among the different art forms in Islamic culture which has survived atrophy. The main part of the thesis is concerned with the decline of Islamic art forms in the Ottoman Empire and under the Safavid Dynasty, since the sixteenth century. It analyzes the political, economic and social factors that had caused the decline while simultaneously led to the penetration of Western cultural trends in the Islamic world. The history of development of Western art styles, in each of the Islamic countries in the Middle East and North Africa including Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Tunis, Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Palestine, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, is traced after a brief historical and social background. The main artistic trends are analyzed, citing the artists that have brought them about, with illustrations of their works. The last part of the thesis establishes the inception of the contemporary calligraphic school of art in the Arab world and Iran, with mention of Turkey. It cites the factors that have induced it, the first artists who started it and its subject matters. It establishes its three main styles, with their various branches, including in-depth analysis and critique of each main style as well as sub-style, including the artists who propagate it, and giving illustrated examples. The placement of the calligraphic school of art, in painting, sculpture and ceramics, within the international art movement, is also mooted. The thesis ends by setting up a link between traditional Islamic art and the contemporary school of art in the Islamic world, according to the definition of Islamic art reached in the first part of the thesis.",301545832,,Dissertations & Theses," Ali Bin Naye, W.Ali Bin NayeW.Ali Bin Naye, W.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757122591 , 44514451 , 101309 , U055838 , U055838", Dissertation/Thesis,1993,, English, English,,1993,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1993,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301545832?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," (UMI)AAIU055838 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Continuity+of+Islamic+art+in+the+20th+century+through+the+contemporary+calligraphic+school+of+art.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1993-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ali+Bin+Naye%2C+W.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.450363678,0.948671241,3175,Unknown,art/music/literature,Mexican avant -garde art and literature; estridentismo,"Estridentismo in Mexico City: Dialogues between Mexican avant -garde art and literature, 1921â€“1924","This dissertation examines the development of estridentismo (â€œstridentismâ€), Mexico's first self-acknowledged avant-garde movement, from the perspective of the visual arts. Estridentismo originated in 1921, in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, with the dissemination of the irreverent manifesto Actual NÂ°1 by the poet Manuel Maples Arce. Seeking cultural renovation, the author called for producing art based on the experience of modernity. A group of avant-garde writers and artists, the estridentistas, rallied to his cause. Long regarded exclusively as a literary movement, estridentismo was grounded in visual models. This study demonstrates that the changes that affected its development occurred as a result of Maples Arce's collaboration with plastic artists, particularly mural painters. Through their example, Maples Arce came to realize that his original proposal was not sustainable in the Mexican context and adapted his writings to reflect a greater social awareness. Throughout the twenties, Mexican artists, faced with the challenge of constructing a new society, sought to reconcile international modernist models with social and local concerns. My dissertation posits that the visual arts are integral to understanding how estridentismo came to embody the structural contradictions of being both international and culturally specific. I demonstrate how in its refusal of simple classification, the case of estridentismo is emblematic of Mexican avant-garde culture of the 1920s. Chapter One delineates Maples Arce's original plan for a Mexican avant-garde. I analyze the manifesto's literary and social significance from the optimistic post-revolutionary moment. Chapter Two reads the origins of muralism in relation to estridentismo, as contemporary proposals for the future of Mexican art. Chapter Three discusses the mutual influences between Maples Arce's theories and the visual arts. Outlining the development of estridentismo as a formal movement, I demonstrate how it came to be defined in the broadest of terms. Chapter Four discusses the paradoxical nature of estridentismo, caught between formal innovation, local forms of expression, and socialist ideals. Although Maples Arce espoused technological modernity, woodcuts and masks, mediums associated with pre-industrial cultures, became paradigmatic estridentista art forms.",305340144,,Dissertations & Theses," Flores, Tatiana EstherFloresEstherTatianaFlores, Tatiana Esther", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765675971 , 30187811 , 66569 , 3088326 , 3088326", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305340144?accountid=14496," 0377 Art History , 0312 Latin American literature"," 0377 Art History , 0312 Latin American literature"," 0377 Art History , 0312 Latin American literature",," 0377 Art History , 0312 Latin American literature"," Art History , Latin American literature"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Art , Avant-garde , Estridentismo , Literature , Mexico City , Murals",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Estridentismo+in+Mexico+City%3A+Dialogues+between+Mexican+avant+-garde+art+and+literature%2C+1921%E2%80%931924&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Flores%2C+Tatiana+Esther&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.903798171,0.925969987,31,Unknown,art/music/literature,mariachi: from rural mestizo cultural expression to an international visual and sound symbol of national identity,"Performing nationalism: Mariachi, media and transformation of a tradition (1920â€“1942)","This dissertation focuses on the development of mariachi as an ensemble and a repertory between 1920 and 1942 with particular attention to relationships with the Mexican and U.S. radio, recording and film industries. Mariachi, a music and dance tradition from Mexicoâ€™s western region was transformed during this period from a rural mestizo cultural expression to an international visual and sound symbol of national identity. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the competing ideologies of hispanismo and indigenismo infused Mexican sociopolitical and cultural discourses with concepts of identity that reflected Spanish and Indigenous influences. In the postrevolutionary period, the government promoted a version of national identity based on the concept of mestizaje located within rural expressive culture. As regional musical traditions became central elements in the project of cultural nationalism, mariachi emerged as a marker of national identity and symbol of mexicanidad. With the movement of large populations to Mexico City in the mid 1920s, mariachi was integrated into urban social and cultural life. The activities of U.S. transnational record companies surged in the late 1920s and early 30s through alliances with radio stations and the creation of networks. Radio stations XEB and XEW were the main sources for broadcasting of Mexican popular music and radio shows were designed for the purpose of advertising U.S. consumer products. The creation of radio networks and increased record distribution effectively absorbed mariachi into processes for the media production of culture and â€œsplitâ€ the ensemble from its traditional contexts and practices of performance. With the success of the comedia ranchera film genre in the late 1930s and early 40s, mariachi reached unimaginable heights of popularity. The singing charro, a symbol of machismo and virility, was embodied in the figures and voices of Tito GuÃ­zar and Jorge Negrete - icons of the genre. As a vehicle for the canciÃ³n ranchera, the films of the â€œgolden ageâ€ projected the image and sound of mexicanidad through processes of musical commodification associated with the contexts and conditions of the Mexican and U.S. transnational media industries.",304983966,,Dissertations & Theses," Henriques, Donald AndrewHenriquesAndrewDonaldHenriques, Donald Andrew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1453224391 , 32566761 , 66569 , 9780549386162 , 3294414 , 3294414", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,9.78E+12, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304983966?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Ethnomusicology , Mariachi , Media , Mexico , Nationalism , Performing , Tradition",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performing+nationalism%3A+Mariachi%2C+media+and+transformation+of+a+tradition+%281920%E2%80%931942%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Henriques%2C+Donald+Andrew&amp;isbn=9780549386162&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.958220642,0.913318727,2263,Unknown,art/music/literature,prominent art movements during the 20 th century.,Rhetoric of warning labels: Human figures in cross-cultural design,"Evaluation of warning label design does not always include the perspectives of researchers or graphic designers and legally, warning labels hold no responsibility for changing human behavior. Over the past two decades, much attention to warning label design has come from fields such as human factors, ergonomics, and social psychology, but scholarship on abstract visuals in technical communication is not emphasized. Warning labels use generalized abstract bodies to depict the risk of great and potential hazards, demonstrating a removal from physical reality. This paper will look at warning labels through the lens of abstraction. Abstraction is a non-mimetic form of an object or an idea, and its interpretation greatly depends on the context and culture it is observed in. Arnheim's theory of abstraction can help designers create effective designs that communicate cross-culturally based on a system of symbols, signs and pictures. The range of abstraction is evident in hybrid warnings that employ both symbols and pictures. Historical uses of warning labels have been subtly reshaped over the years from highly modernized images to ones that contain symbolic images that aid context and understanding of risk. To analyze the way culture shapes warning images, vending machine warnings were analyzed to understand how context and culture affects the abstraction. A selection of wet floor signs was also analyzed for the cultural influences observed in the abstract representations of human figures. Even though the images are standardized, the international images uncovered links between the designs of the warnings and their current usage that suggested they were influenced by prominent art movements during the 20 th century. While standardization is the surest way to represent ideas across all audiences, the images analyzed in this paper demonstrate that warning label designers can stretch the boundaries of standard designs. Very few of the images remained constant between signs that demonstrate the same warnings, which suggests that viewers are responding well to localized images.",1559198038,,Dissertations & Theses," Jacobsen, Kylie M.JacobsenM.KylieJacobsen, Kylie M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3420933961 , 90106382 , 66569 , 9781321026191 , 1560295 , 1560295", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1559198038?accountid=14496," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric"," Technical Communication , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Abstraction , Cross-cultural , Design , Human , Risk , Warning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rhetoric+of+warning+labels%3A+Human+figures+in+cross-cultural+design&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jacobsen%2C+Kylie+M.&amp;isbn=9781321026191&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.991046236,0.992684065,905,Right,capital,"Reebok labor practices, ""pro company"" unions",Putting corporate codes of conduct regarding labor standards in a global -national -local context: A case study of Reebok's athletic footwear supplier factory in China,"This thesis examines the dynamics, possibilities and limitations of corporate codes of conduct---one kind of private regulation tool regarding labor practices flourishing in the past decade's escalating anti-sweatshop campaigns and corporate social responsibility movement---in improving China's labor standards under global-national-local context.

I found the implementation of Reebok labor-related codes at workplace of FS had paradoxical effects on improving labor standards---although codes implementation resulted in a ""race to ethical and legal minimum"" when the most inhumane and obviously illegal sweatshop labor abuses were curbed, Chinese workers of FS were forced to work harder, faster but earn less payment and the employee-elected trade union installed in FS worked more like a ""company union"" rather than an autonomous workers' organization representing worker' interests. Furthermore, to explain the limited effectiveness of codes in improving labor standards, especially on issues of living wage and workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, I found the result was determined by both interconnected structural prohibiting forces embedded in industrial, international, national and local contexts and negotiated agencies of international labor right advocacy groups, consumers, Reebok, FS management, and local branches of Chinese official trade union.",304911763,,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, XiaominYuXiaominYu, Xiaomin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1276405981 , 35906451 , 66569 , 3250560 , 3250560", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304911763?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," Social sciences , Athletic footwear , China , Codes of conduct , Corporate , Factory , Globalization , Labor standards , Reebok",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Putting+corporate+codes+of+conduct+regarding+labor+standards+in+a+global+-national+-local+context%3A+A+case+study+of+Reebok%27s+athletic+footwear+supplier+factory+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Xiaomin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.758042031,0.963050056,987,Right,capital,agribusiness and exploitation in the Ecuadorian banana industry,Growing organic bananas in Ecuador,"This project examines organic banana production in El Oro, Ecuador.

Analysts and observers agree that Indonesia has past a point of no return regarding rehabilitation of most of its national forest cover, while pollution from mining and over-fishing is taking its toll locally, to the extent that social and political upheaval is certainly a possibility in the medium- to long-term as communities suffer a loss of livelihoods and opportunity. The Indonesian public and policy makers are aware of their predicament and this consciousness is being converted into legislation both nationally and regionally. However, corruption and the lack of a clear demarcation between central and regional responsibilities allows the degradation and destruction to continue and even accelerate. The recent increase in demand for palm oil (used as a bio-fuel particularly in Europe), further complicates the situation, as this has now become a new incentive to continue the felling of swathes of forest (legally and illegally), and the draining of boglands. This paper tracks natural resource management and extraction over the past sixty years in Indonesia by taking an approach that highlights degradation of the environment through political evolution and development models. It juxtaposes political developments (from the autocratic and corrupt regime of President Soeharto, through to the Asian financial crisis of 1998 and the beginning of democracy under the reformasi movement), against development economics theory and practice - traditional Washington Consensus policies including the involvement of the International Monetary Fund, as well as a more sustainable approach to development that incorporates multi-tiered approaches including social and environmental inputs. It highlights the paradox of accelerated ecological destruction during the recently reformed decentralized democracy, compared to the relatively controlled extraction under dictatorship, and discusses approaches for environmental sustainability, including environmental accounting, for the present and future.",304329841,,Dissertations & Theses," McClellan, IanMcClellanIanMcClellan, Ian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1481675011 , 39239581 , 66569 , 9780549482475 , 1452305 , 1452305", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304329841?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science"," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science"," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science",," 0332 History , 0615 Political science , 0768 Environmental science"," History , Political science , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indonesia%27s+natural+resources+and+the+environment%3A+Development%2C+politics%2C+and+ecological+destruction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McClellan%2C+Ian&amp;isbn=9780549482475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.911205214,0.971672864,2221,Right,capital,post-New Deal retirement,"Privatizing the Golden Years: Power and Politics in American Pensions, 1935â€“1990","During the 2008 economic crisis, the private pension system in America lost approximately 26 percent of its value. Those going into retirement that year whose plans were heavily invested in the stock market saw large portions of their savings vanish overnight. The controversies concerning the viability of America's heavily marketized retirement system in a context of global economic insecurity underscores a historical puzzle about how American old-age security came to be so dependent on the market in the first place. In particular, why was the post-New Deal retirement security system set-up as a public-private mix? And why, in the subsequent decades, did the private element become both relatively larger and increasingly subject to market outcomes? Conventional accounts highlight a number of explanatory factors such as union weakness, firm influence and policy feedbacks. Drawing on new archival sources, I reassess these claims by comparing each of the major marketizing episodes of institutional change in the private pension system since World War II: (1) the growth of collectively bargained occupational pensions after the war in conjunction with the stagnation of Social Security replacement rates, (2) the movement of pension fund investments out of the bond market and into the stock market, and (3) the most recent numerical displacement of defined-benefit plans with defined-contribution, 401(k)-type, plans. Through an analysis of each of these episodes, I develop a more satisfactory explanation, which, instead of focusing on identifying causal primacy between interest groups (unions and businesses) and institutions (constitutional constrains and new laws), theorizes the interplay between these forces at a middle-level of abstraction. I term this an interactional approach. The project identifies three interactional processes of interest for studies of institutional change: (1) political institutions mediate interest group influence on welfare institutions, (2) political institutions can shape the strategies interest groups take in regards to welfare policy, and (3) political institutions drive changes in welfare policies relative to the balance of power between interest groups. Together, these processes help account for the development of America's retirement security system since the New Deal.",1468937374,,Dissertations & Theses," McCarthy, Michael A.McCarthyA.MichaelMcCarthy, Michael A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3159800551 , 82450892 , 66569 , 9781303559327 , 3602696 , 3602696", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468937374?accountid=14496," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Gerontology , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Firms , Pensions , Political institutions , Retirement , Unions , Welfare state",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privatizing+the+Golden+Years%3A++Power+and+Politics+in+American+Pensions%2C+1935%E2%80%931990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCarthy%2C+Michael+A.&amp;isbn=9781303559327&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.3785177,0.927197564,2491,Right,capital,privatisation of the Telecom Corporation,"The deregulation and privatisation of New Zealand telecommunications: An economic, political and ideological analysis","Profound changes have been made to New Zealand society, the economy, and government over the last decade. These changes are due as much to world events as they are to national occurrences. New Zealand is part of a world-economy and, as such, is influenced by other nation states and global economic trends. These influences have extended beyond just trade in goods and services to include policies relating to enterprise, competition, and trade. In New Zealand, like many other countries belonging to the OECD, such policies have influenced key personnel in business and the government and, as a consequence, have led to fundamental changes in the political economy of the nation. This study goes beyond a political economic analysis of the deregulation and privatisation of New Zealand telecommunications and seeks to determine whether a dominant or hegemonic perception of the role of the state in society was a prominent factor in the restructuring of the economy initiated by the fourth Labour Government. It begins by taking New Zealand as a case study and through an historical analysis of economic and social dependency, outlines the political, regulatory, and ideological influences that underpinned the deregulatory movement. This sets the scene for an inquiry into the steps leading to the privatisation of the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand in an attempt to understand the reasons why Telecom was privatised and what this will mean in terms of opportunities for competitors and regulators. The study critiques the privatisation of the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand and discusses the organisation's future in relation to the opportunities available for telecommunications providers in a lightly regulated environment. The study concludes with an evaluation of current moves to reshape the New Zealand state including the implications this will have for telecommunications users and providers.

Featuring unprecedented partnerships between insurance corporations and development organisations, microinsurance is aimed at extending micro-cost insurance and social safety to low-income populations traditionally marginalised by these services.

Here microinsurance is a nascent intervention, and this study examines the provision, availability and impacts of microinsurance in the disaster-prone rural Malda district of West Bengalâ€”a state famous for its pro-poor and left-leaning government. Research for this thesis was conducted in the form of a multi-sited case study spanning a period of six months from May to October 2007. A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods such as household surveying, direct observation, open-ended semi-structured interviews, key-informant interviews, life histories and snowball sampling were employed for data collection.

It was animated by an official creed, referred to as the â€œ mission civilisatrice â€ or â€œmission to civilize,â€ that established boundaries for what the French government would and would not do in the colonies. At the same time that the French empire was expanding, a religious revival was underway. It spawned a Catholic missionary movement that made France the most significant missionary-sending nation of the nineteenth century. Despite the magnitude of this movement, no studies have been made of the specifically Catholic interpretation of and contribution to the French doctrine of colonial expansionâ€”the â€œmission to civilize.â€ This study attempts to connect the missionary revival with French colonial expansion by focusing upon the issue that first bound together the religious and political conceptions of France's modern mission abroadâ€”slaveryâ€”in the places where debate over its abolition was the locus of social and cultural contention: the colonies of Guadeloupe, Guyane, Martinique, RÃ©union (Bourbon until 1848), and SÃ©nÃ©gal from 1815 to 1852. Whereas, early in the nineteenth century, Catholic missionaries to the French colonies worked mainly with European colonists, by the 1830s and throughout the 1840s they increasingly came to work with the slave population. Although often opposed to slavery in principle, its abolition was far from a pressing concern for most missionaries. Of much greater interest was the extension of primary education, vocational training, and religious instruction to slaves themselves-an endeavor that missionaries described as the â€œmoralizationâ€ of the slave population and which they considered a fundamental necessity before the abolition of slavery could be successfully accomplished. The French government seized upon the financial support of missionary â€œmoralizationâ€ as a means by which to give the appearance of assisting the abolitionist cause while in fact continuing to encourage its delay. Colonial administrators came to rely upon missionary â€œmoralizationâ€ to the extent that, following the revolutionary abolition of slavery in 1848, a new republican government increased its support for missionaries. An attendant increase in religious participation by the former slave population buttressed Catholic arguments for the efficacy of religion as a civilizing force. The Catholic â€œmission to moralizeâ€ among the slaves of the French colonies created an interdependance with the French government so that the national â€œmission to civilizeâ€ ultimately borrowed much of its content from its religious counterpart.",305316149,,Dissertations & Theses," Feay, Troy ErnestFeayErnestTroyFeay, Troy Ernest", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765988181 , 30996651 , 66569 , 3094676 , 3094676", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305316149?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history"," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history"," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history",," 0335 European history , 0328 Black history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0336 Latin American history , 0331 African history"," European history , Black history , Religious congregations , Latin American history , African history"," Social sciences , Africans , Colonies , French , Missionaries , Moralize , Slaves",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mission+to+moralize%3A+Slaves%2C+Africans%2C+and+missionaries+in%0Athe+French+colonies%2C+1815%E2%80%931852&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feay%2C+Troy+Ernest&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.239430899,0.906353468,1643,Right,colonization,Dutch Indies Chinese transnational movmenets,"Encountering competing empires: Journeying Chinese communities in Southeast Asia under Chinese, Dutch, and British imperial rule","This dissertation examines the relationship between Chinaâ€™s expansionism and overseas Chinese empowerment in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It looks at the connection between the Chinese state's ambition of extending its political sphere beyond its territorial boundaries and overseas Chinese increasing political, social, and economic rights. By focusing on the Chinese in the Dutch East this multi-sited research shows that the two seemingly different projects, namely the construction of a pan-Chinese nation and state beyond its territorial boundaries and the overseas Chinese empowerment in colonial Southeast Asia are mutually enforcing processes that developed in tandem. By approaching this topic from the perspectives of imperial competition and journeying overseas Chinese, I argue that Chinaâ€™s construction of a pan-Chinese nation and state, and its competition with European empires and the emerging Japan for overseas Chinese support generated a new identification space for the Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. The competition between empires for overseas Chinese support created opportunities for the overseas Chinese to transform their status from stateless subjects to Chinese nationals, Japanese imperial subjects, and Dutch colonial subjects. My dissertation reveals that Dutch Indies Chinese, a politically unimportant overseas Chinese community that was not recognized by any empire as official subjects before the late nineteenth century, subsequently became pivotal for the promulgation of new state policies. They organized transnational movements in the cities along the Chinese and Southeast Asian coasts and enhanced their statuses by maneuvering Chinaâ€™s policies and negotiating for political and socioeconomic privileges in the Dutch colony.",1506548236,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Oi YanLiuYanOiLiu, Oi Yan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3244031161 , 86078302 , 66569 , 9781303749247 , 3579114 , 3579114", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1506548236?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," History , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , British Empire , Chinese expansionism , Colonialism , Dutch East Indies , Imperialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Encountering+competing+empires%3A+Journeying+Chinese+communities+in+Southeast+Asia+under+Chinese%2C+Dutch%2C+and+British+imperial+rule&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Oi+Yan&amp;isbn=9781303749247&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.627676691,0.99974381,1380,Left,communism/socialism,Chinese Marxism,Tentative discussion of the prosperity and development of chinese marxist historiography in yan'an area during the war of resistance,"Translation from original language as provided by author The generation, development and spread of Chinese Marxist historiography is an indispensable cultural support to the revolutionary career of the Communist Party of China and China's socialist construction. During the war of resistance, Marxist historiography in Yan'an area gradually gained in strength and echoed with Marxist historiography mainly concentrated in areas ruled by Kuomintang with the encouragement and the meticulous guidance from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. They together became the important arteries and veins of Chinese culture during the Anti-Japanese War, thus provided words of support and academic weapon for the Anti-Japanese War led by the Chinese Communist Party. It was no accident that Marxist historiography rose in Yan'an area during the war of resistance, for it both had historical causes and realistic reasons. It was not only influenced by Japanese Marxist historiography, especially by Stalin's Soviet Union's historiography directly or indirectly, but also inherited the tradition of the twenty-five histories in fact, and even had something similar to new schools and new ideas since ""the revolution in historiographic world"" called as non-Marxist historiography. The Marxist historiography should combat applied historiography and historical view of emperor, resist the retro trend of the nationalists and settle internal disagreements among the communists. It was in response to the call of ""characterized Chinese scholarship movement"" and was the reflection of the international relationship in wartime, still was subordinate to the comprehensive construction of the new state apparatus from the red political power. Chinese Marxist historiography in Yan'an area during the war of resistance could not take shape or develop without the troika's favorable cooperation-the formation of the Marxist historians, the establishment and evolution of the historiographers' institute and the popularity of history education. In this period, Marxist historiography worker were devoted to the history field covering general history, intellectual history, specialism history, historical theory, historical philosophy and popular history. As a result, the researches involved were abroad and comprehensive, including social nature and historical rule, recent history and party history, history philosophy and ideology culture, peasant wars and the movements for workers and peasants, ethnic issues, international relations, history teaching and so on. Therefore, when combing the vein of Chinese Marxist historiography in Yan'an area during the war of resistance, we could also pick out its important features. The historians in Yan'an area differed from Chinese traditional and modern historians in Guidance theories, historical thinking, stylistic rules, usage of historical data,linguistic features, collection collaboration and so on. Besides, it inherited ethnic characteristics of Chinese historiography, absorbed scientific principles or laws of the Western historiography and carried forward party spirit principles of the Soviet Union. This paper is to draw a moral from Chinese Marxist historiography in Yan'an area during the war of resistance by serious probe and analysis, as well as providing references for the development of Chinese Marxist historiography under the guidance of the materialism of history, which can give effective play of its social function based on the national conditions in China in the face of the impact of the Neo-Confucianism, the Neo-Taoism, post-modern thinking, post-post modern thinking and many other Chinese and Western ideological trends of historiography.

While in this systematic study object, the early study of this subject is not enough. And the point of this thesis is to study a part of this systematic subject in certain period that is the First Revolution period. I will give a general discussion concerned about the class theories which the CPC formed during the First Revolution period. First, in this paper, there will be a general demonstration about the main ideas formed by the CPC in that period. The related understanding and discussions about certain subjects in the revolution situation, as well as the resolution passed by the CPC committee could demonstrate the evolution process of the CPC's class theories in that historic situation. Second, in this paper, there will be a discussion about the factors which affected the class theories formed by the CPC in that period. During the First Revolution period, there were two main sources which affected the CPC in the understanding of China's social class problems, one is the theoretical element and the other is the CPC' practice experience in that period. As to the theoretical factors, the study and the understanding of Marxism by the pioneer CPC members is an important source. While in that period, under the special international situation, the Soviet Union revolution experience and the theories of Socialist revolution by Lenin have a more direct affection to CPC. On the other hand, not long after the foundation, the CPC has taken part in the revolution. During the process, the victory or the failure of the revolution is decided by the different classes of the society. By contracting and working with the different classes at that time, the experience gives the CPC a deeper acknowledgement of the characteristics of the classes. And the acknowledgments from both the revolution theories and the practice have a complicated relationship and they interact each other. Last, the paper analyzed the significance of the social class theories formed by CPC in that period. The immature class theories formed by CPC at that time is a basis of the future New Democratic Revolution Theory. Meantime, under the direct of these theories, the CPC achieved a lot in the development of Labor movement as well as the Peasant movement; and the CPC learned a lot in dealing the relationship with the bourgeois. On the other hand, the failures in the movement during the revolution period have disclosed that the CPC was still immature in the subject of the understanding of China's social classes and the lessons in the revolution period would be a treasure for the",1874969489,,Dissertations & Theses," Tan, HuanTanHuanTan, Huan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319380751 , 111160532 , 189128 , 10490970 , 10490970", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874969489?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAI10490970 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analysis+of+the+chinese+communist+party+social+class+theories+during+the+period+of+the+firt+civil+revolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tan%2C+Huan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.343128929,0.995631438,3812,Left,communism/socialism,Communist Party of China,A Comprehensive Study of the Development of the CPC's Democratic Thoughts,"Before the foundation of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter CPC) the Chinese democratic revolution has been occurred. The Chinese revolution has been continued for several decades before CPC has become the major revolution force in Chinese political arena. The Revolution under the leadership of CPC has been the continuation of the Chinese democratic revolution indeed. Therefore, the following characteristic background for the foundation of CPC goes as: firstly, its long period of living in isolation and its serious political corruption have caused the under development of Chinese economy and thus the level of the productive forces for the development of democracy in China is kept really low; secondly, the invasion of the Imperial Powers has robbed China of its sovereignty as well as the independence of the Chinese nation; thirdly, the 1911 Revolution (Xinhaigemin) has overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China, but the newly born Republic of China headed by Jiang Jieshi later has turned into the regime of big landlords and bourgeoisie. It has not paved the way for the development of Chinese National Capitalism, but threw itself into the lap of Imperial Powers to suppress the development of Chinese National Capitalism. The nature of its Class has determined itself to fail to set down the right policy for the classes and politics in China so as to complete an effective political conformity of the Chinese society. Therefore, after the establishment of the Republic of China, the whole country still remains disintegrated, and the Chinese people still live an extremely poor life, let alone their independence and democratic rights in China. In 1917, the October Revolution in Russia won its victory and then it has brought Marxism into China. With its revolutionary and scientific and practical features, the Marxism has been accepted by the progressive intellectuals in China, therefore, CPC has come into being which has been the product of the combination of Marxism and Chinese revolutionary practices. Since its foundation, CPC has been guided by the Marxist proletariat revolutionary thoughts and struggled for the ideal of Communism. CPC has worked out the proletariat revolutionary strategy, adopted the democratic principles of Marxism, established the Marxist Party and Army and led Chinese people to carry on the democratic revolution in China. During the Chinese revolution, with the combination of democratic thoughts of Marxism and the revolutionary practice in China led by CPC, the CPC democratic thoughts have come into being. Thereafter the CPC democratic thoughts have been developing. This dissertation aims at making a comprehensive study of the CPC democratic thoughts in six chapters. Chapter one has discussed the establishment of CPC democratic thoughts. The CPC democratic thoughts set the Marxist democratic thoughts as its core with the background of particular Chinese revolution and rich Chinese Civilization. Therefore, the establishment of CPC democratic thoughts have been influenced by the following three forces: Marxist democratic thoughts, capitalist democratic thoughts, and the Chinese traditional thoughts such as â€œhuman-oriented and rule of virtueâ€. Since the establishment of the CPC democratic thoughts have come into being in the course of democratic revolution, it has presented itself with two features: adopting to conditions of Chinese revolution and responding to the task of the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, China has remained as no independence to the outside and no sovereignty inside, its people has lived in extremely poverty. Just like the famous scholar in Peking University, Prof. Guan Haiting pointed out in his writing, The Review of History of 20th Century Chinese Political Development, as to the Chinese people living in such a poor life, democracy has become a real luxury in their life, the first thing to do for the Chinese people at that time should be conducting the revolution to save the nation in peril, therefore, the Chinese democratic movement often serves as the tool to save the nation in peril and it remains not as its aim at all. That is why we can say that the CPC democratic thoughts have the revolutionary feature from its very beginning. The CPC democratic thoughts has developed with the focus of conducting Chinese revolution and taking the regime for the revolution, and with its aim of capturing the victory of the revolution in China and establishing of the new democratic state. Therefore the CPC democratic thoughts have been embodied as the concrete revolutionary strategy and tactics, such as â€œthe mass lineâ€ and â€œunited frontâ€. As to the periods of establishment and development of the CPC democratic thoughts, the period from the foundation of CPC to the victory of new democratic revolution is the most important period for the primary establishment of the CPC democratic thoughts. Chapter two has talked about the development of the CPC democratic thoughts. Before the foundation of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, what kind of state-ship and government should be established in China has become an urgent task for CPC. At that time, guided by Marxist thought of Proletariat dictatorship and based on the practical condition of China, the CPC has creatively brought forward the Peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship which guided the new China to establish the state-ship of the Peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship and its basic democratic system, and has pave the way for the socialist democratic system in the way of government guarantee. In addition, CPC has guided Chinese people to pass the first basic law, namely, the Constitution in China in 1954. The Constitution has stipulated the state system of the Peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship in China, the system of government of peopleâ€™s congress, the basic democratic system of multi â€“nationality, the system of multi-party co-operation and democratic supervision, and democracy at basic levels. It has also regulated peopleâ€™s basic democratic rights which has embodied the CPC democracy and democratic legal system thoughts. At the same time, CPC has led people to conduct the economic building and set the first five-year plan and the target of industrial development which has lain a solid base for the establishment of the socialist democratic system and embodied the CPC thought that the productive forces is the base for development of democracy. After foundation of Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC), the state system of Peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship is of the new democracy. During that period, the public ownership as the dominated position in the national economy has not established, and there are also five kinds of economic forces in the countryâ€™s economy which are not of the socialism. Guided by the ideal of the socialist democracy, CPC has renewed national economy and put forward their transition towards the socialist economy. CPC has regulated this transition into the Constitution which is the embodiment of CPCâ€™s building of socialist democracy in China. The transition towards the socialist economy, the CPC democratic thoughts has also developed into the socialist democratic thoughts. After â€œthe Three Great Remouldâ€ movements, namely, movements of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, China has established the socialist democracy system and pushed the development of the CPC democratic thoughts into that of the Socialist democracy thoughts. This period has been the period of establishing and developing of CPC socialist democracy and legal system thoughts with its focus of creation of peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship, transition towards the socialism, paving the way for building of socialism and making perfect the legal system. Chapter three has focused on the ups and downs of the CPC democratic thoughts. After the completion of â€œthe Three Great Remouldâ€ movements, the new system of socialism has been established in China. The development of Chinese democracy and that of the CPC democratic thoughts both have been based on the socialism thereafter. Before and after â€œthe 8th CPC National Congressâ€, the CPC has made a lot of exploration in the way of how to improve and develop the socialist democracy. The CPC has found more problems and studied more issues. For example,, Mr. Mao Zedong has discussed how to balance the relation between the central government and the local government in his On the Ten Major Relations and on its related discussions. In the field of scientific work, the CPC has adopted the guideline of â€œletting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contendâ€, developed a policy of â€œlong-term co-existence and mutual supervisionâ€ with other democratic parties, and formed the thought of â€œhandling correctly the contradictions among the peopleâ€ and so on. During September 15-27, 1956, the 8th CPC National Congress was held in Beijing which was held with the background of the victory of the socialism and the realization of its fundamental change of social conditions in China. The congress has reflected the status of the every social class and Chinese changes in their political, cultural and economic senses. The congress has summed up the experiences of the Peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship as well as of constructing the newly socialist democracy. More importantly, the congress was held after the 20th National Congress of Communist Party of the Soviet Union and has discussed the malpractice of the Soviet Union Mode and stressed the issue of the development of democracy and brought forward many thoughts and strategies of constructing the socialist democracy. But due to the pressing economic development and the threat from the international capitalism, due to the unilateralism of developing the economy and due to the influence of the malpractice of the Soviet Union Mode, the â€œLeftâ€ mistakes have occurred in the CPC and the thoughts of the 8th National Congress has been given up in the practice of socialist construction. During the transformation to the socialist construction, the development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been misled and the â€œLeftâ€ thought in CPC has been spread unchecked and prevented the development of the socialist democracy and led to the happening of the tragedy of â€œCultural Revolutionâ€. Chapter four has stressed the recovery and the development of the CPC democratic thoughts. The opening of 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the CPC has indicated the ending of the â€œLeftâ€ errors in CPC. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the CPC has resumed the Marxist thought line of â€œseeking truth from the factsâ€ and renewed the correct thought of how to develop the socialist democratic thoughts around the 8th National Congress of CPC. During the correction of the â€œLeftâ€ errors, CPC has set forth the Four Fundamental Principles (the socialist road, the Peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship, Marxist-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thoughts and the leadership of the CPC) which guide the construction of the socialist democracy. Along the correct guideline of â€œseeking the truth from factsâ€, the CPC has set forth the thoughts of reforming system. As to the economic system, the CPC has brought forward the central task of the economic construction and come back to the road of Marxist idea that â€œthe productive forces have been the base for the development of democracy. Constructing the socialist democracy must be needed to enhance the construction of the legal system and democratic system, and make the democratic system institutionalized and legalized so that to meet the requirement of extending democracy and of constructing the socialist modernization. The CPC has brought forth the thought of reforming the system of cadre leadership which starts to the prologue of reforming the political system. Chapter five has detailed the comprehensive development of the CPC democratic thoughts. On the 12th National Congress of CPC, the CPC has stated the importance of developing democracy from the overall situation of constructing the socialist modernization. The CPC headed By Mr. Deng Xiaoping has changed the modernization development strategy from its unilateralism of developing the economy into the comprehensive one, in other words, modernization in China means not only the modernization of economy, but also the modernization of politics and culture. The CPC has also set forth the task of building our great motherland into a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country. Thereafter the CPC democratic thoughts has finally shook off from its thinking of revolution and stepped into the suitable track of developing the socialist democracy in China, set out the strategy of comprehensive development of the society and has made the democracy as one of the developing target of the whole development of the society. The reforming of the political system has officially brought forward only after the primary success of the economic reforming. With the deepening economic system reform, the former political system has not met the development of economy. In order to liberate the productive forces and shake off the bondage of related superstructure, the 13th National Congress of CPC has stressed the thought of reforming the political system. On the 13th National Congress of CPC, the CPC has stated the thought of reforming the political system in a comprehensive way which is the further advance in developing the CPC democratic thoughts. With the further development of reforming and opening-up, the CPC has continued its exploration in developing the socialism and later the CPC has developed the theory that China was in the primary stage of socialism and the thought of the socialist commodity economy and further developed into forming the new theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Among which building the socialist democratic thoughts with Chinese characteristics has become the advancement of the CPC democratic thoughts. With the guideline of building the socialist democratic thoughts with Chinese characteristics, the CPC has formed its reform thought of political system with the base of â€œadhering to and improving the socialist democracy systemâ€ in its practice of political reforms. With the advancement in legal system construction and publication of democracy, the CPC has developed into the thought of â€œruling with law and constructing the socialist legal countryâ€. After the successes in reforms in economic and political systems and with the start of building a well-off society in an all-round way, the CPC has pointed out the new thought of development of political civilization as its democratic thoughts. The development of political civilization has come into being with the development of the times and it is the requirement for the CPC to build a well-off society in an all-round way and it is also the advancement of CPC democratic thoughts. In terms of its contents, the development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been centered on how to reform and improve the basic system of the socialism, and the development stage is its mature period for the CPC democratic thoughts. Chapter six has summed up the path and characteristics of the CPC democratic thoughts. The development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been influenced by many factors, such as social conditions for the economy, peopleâ€™s education level, peopleâ€™s knowledge of law, and democratic practice. It is clear that the CPC democratic thoughts have been a combination of many factors. With the influence of these factors, the CPC democratic thoughts have gained their characteristics: peopleâ€™s democratic dictatorship, socialism, adaptation to the revolution and construction, keeping on developing and so on. In general, the various stages of the CPC democratic thoughts have indicated a progressive course in which the latter stage has advanced with the base of the former. From the revolution period to the socialist construction period, the CPC democratic thoughts have adapted to the requirement of revolution first and then of socialist construction, and experienced the following stages: from the democratic thoughts of the revolutionary party to that of the party in power, from its stress on seizing the victory of the revolution and creating new system to stressing the socialist systematic construction and legal development, from its stressing that democracy should be submitted to the needs of revolution and economic construction to the idea that the democracy construction has become the important part of collective targets of socialist construction. In the part of conclusion, this dissertation has stressed again that the CPC democratic thoughts have been guided by the ideal of communism and developed with the direction of socialist democratic practice, in other words, the CPC democratic thoughts have developed with the direction of communist ideal and also with the direction of socialist practice which reflects that the basic law of Chinese Socialist democracy development led by the CPC, namely, from its ideal to its practice, and again from its practice to its ideal. Therefore, not only from the viewpoint of the CPC democratic thoughts, but also from the practice guided by the CPC democratic thoughts, the ideal is not far from us, our theory could give us strong motivation an push us forwards our ideal; as long as we strive for our ideal with heart and soul, we human beings could step into the glorious future of Communism.",1025010154, ä¸­å›½å…±äº§å…šæ°‘ä¸»æ€æƒ³å‘å±•ç ”ç©¶,Dissertations & Theses," Lu, YiLuYiLu, Yiå¢è½¶", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711563571 , 70481472 , 189128 , H150165 , H150165", Dissertation/Thesis,2005,, Chinese, Chinese, ä¸­å›½å…±äº§å…šæ°‘ä¸»æ€æƒ³å‘å±•ç ”ç©¶,2005,PQDT - Global,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1025010154?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH150165 , Social sciences , ä¸­å›½å…±äº§å…šã€æ°‘ä¸»æ€æƒ³ã€ã€the CCPã€democratic thoughtsã€",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Comprehensive+Study+of+the+Development+of+the+CPC%27s+Democratic+Thoughts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lu%2C+Yi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.272584945,0.98273449,3425,Left,communism/socialism,socialism in Germany,REMNANTS OF AN UNWELCOME PAST: THE EXISTENCE OF NEO-NATIONAL SOCIALISM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY,"The thesis developed directly from an interest in the issue of terrorism and political violence, as studied for my MA degree. In the case of the Federal Republic of Germany politically motivated violence has seemed almost exclusively, judging from published material, to have left-wing origins, as in the case of the Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Faction) and the Revolutionare Zellen (Revolutionary Cells). This thesis sets out, however, to examine the existence of terrorism from the right and to assess its significance. The thesis has been divided into eight chapters. It begins by looking at the existence of right-wing extremism. Chapter one examines the potential sympathy amongst the West German electorate for right-wing extremist sentiment. Chapter two traces the development and history of organised right-wing extremism from 1945 to 1990 and shows that the rise of the Republikaner in 1989 marked the third ascent of right-wing extremism in the FRG. Subsequent chapters focus on the adherents of neo-National Socialism as it is from this area, for the most part, the right-wing acts of violence emanate. Chapter three investigates the rise of neo-Nazism at the end of the 1970s and traces its development, its leaders, membership and international connections. The fourth chapter illustrates the objectives of the neo-Nazis by examining the ideology behind it. Chapter five focuses on the issue of right-wing terrorism and argues that the violence from the right represents a more serious threat to public order than is imagined. Chapter six seeks to explain the appeal of neo-Nazism and provides an account of the social composition of neo-Nazism while the seventh chapter examines the political and judicial reaction to the existence of the neo-Nazi movement. Finally, the last chapter pulls all the above strands together to present a picture of neo-Nazism at the beginning of the 1990s and assesses its position in the newly united Germany.",303986894,,Dissertations & Theses," MCGOWAN, IVOR LEEMCGOWANLEEIVORMCGOWAN, IVOR LEE", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745163111 , 31188441 , 66569 , DX94908 , DX94908", Dissertation/Thesis,1991,, English, English,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303986894?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology"," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology"," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology",," 0700 Social structure , 0627 Criminology"," Social structure , Criminology", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=REMNANTS+OF+AN+UNWELCOME+PAST%3A+THE+EXISTENCE+OF+NEO-NATIONAL+SOCIALISM+IN+THE+FEDERAL+REPUBLIC+OF+GERMANY&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MCGOWAN%2C+IVOR+LEE&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.017662638,0.970418166,26,Left,communism/socialism,"democracy, Marxism, and anarchy",The challenge of organization: Anarchist and Marxist politics since the First International,"My investigation deploys a genealogical analysis of the relationship between Marxist and anarchist theories of organization, by locating the most profound and deep-seated antagonisms and similarities between these traditions. This project identifies how aspects of classical anarchist and Marxist thought---as it developed in and around the time of the International Working Men's Association---formulate antecedent characteristics that influence and permeate contemporary radical social movements. I show that despite their cleavages, current Marxist and anarchist movements contain the capacity to strengthen their bonds of solidarity and maintain sustainable alliances and coalitions. I argue that both Marxists and anarchists must accept a plural definition of 'democracy'---described here as a complex system that attempts to create mechanisms in which the maximum number of persons affected by a decision can participate in the process of orchestrating organizational goals and strategies---if these traditions are to effectively work together and create a viable socialist alternative to global capitalism.",304965028,,Dissertations & Theses," Stevens, AndrewStevensAndrewStevens, Andrew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1166579701 , 34159951 , 66569 , 9780494154298 , MR15429 , MR15429", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,9.78E+12, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304965028?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science",," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science"," Social research , Political science", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+challenge+of+organization%3A+Anarchist+and+Marxist+politics+since+the+First+International&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stevens%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9780494154298&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.693963025,0.966091907,3397,Left,communism/socialism,German socialism in the UK,"German socialism in british exile, 1840-1859","Between 1840 and 1860 much of the development of early German socialism and social democracy occurred in emigrants' communities abroad, the most important of which was in London. This thesis examines the political activities, organisations and debates in this colony, which for many years also formed the social and intellectual context of Marx's ideas. The organisational centre for socialist exiles was the German Workers' Educational Association. Within German artisanal socialism, it became the single most important centre of ideological debate of the `utopian' Weitling's doctrines, of Marx's views, and of early socialist internationalism. After the failure of the 1848 revolution, the returning refugees fragmented into mutually hostile groups of socialists and non-socialist democrats. Many socialists, however, were also attracted by the uncompromising revolutionarism of the Blanquists, and when this began to clash with Marx's economic analysis, the main organisation of the socialists, the Communist League, split. The public image of exile politics, however, was dominated by the much larger factions of exiled democrats (around Gottfried Kinkel and Arnold Ruge), who are analysed here with respect to their attitude to socialist demands. In particular the larger section of the Communist League under August Willich co-operated closely with non-socialist democrats in order to promote a revolutionary revival at home, as well as dominating the Germans' relations to both Chartists and French exiles. On the whole, thus, the socialist movement was much broader and more tolerant of other groups than the previous scholarly concentration on Marx's politics alone would suggest. The mid-fifties have long been regarded as a period of decline in socialist development, but in London the Germans continued to be involved in propaganda and organisation. A new international association represented a wide variety of exiled socialists, ranging from Weitlingian communists to those straddling socialism and liberal democracy. The dissertation concludes with the renewed conflict between the socialists and democrats in the late 1850s, which was focussed intensively for the first time on the issue of national unification.",301523958,,Dissertations & Theses," Lattek, ChristineLattekChristineLattek, Christine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756102841 , 44242281 , 101309 , U025660 , U025660", Dissertation/Thesis,1990,, English, English,,1990,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301523958?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU025660 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=German+socialism+in+british+exile%2C+1840-1859&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lattek%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.370713867,0.964481137,1047,Left,communism/socialism,Mao Zedong,The research on mao zedong's anti-bureaucratism theory,"Translation from original language as provided by author Bureaucratism, referring to the kind of leadership styles that act as losing contact with reality and the masses and being the master of people, is a common phenomenon of the social life. It's the counter of the values of modern society such as freedom, democracy, and equality and a retarder of the development of the society, so anti-bureaucratism is an important part of the democratic revolution and social constructions. As the leader of Chinese democratic revolution and a founder of socialist construction, anti-bureaucratism is also one of the subjects of his theories all through his life. As a result, the research of his anti-bureaucratism theory has got important meanings in both the theory and the reality. Both the goal and the power of the New Democratic Revolution contain the request of anti-bureaucratism, which make a relation of cause and result. Mao Zedong took series of measures in the revolutionary procession to fight against bureaucratism which has remarkable effects, therefore, the procession armed by democracy eventually destroyed Chiang Kai-shek's new warlord rules. So the fight against anti-bureaucratism is not only the key of Mao Zedong's secret of defeating the enemy, but also configured a new model of politics, which offered a theoretical foundation for the establishment of a new country. After new China was founded, the first and foremost task is to establish and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, but a considerable number of the party members tainted with the bad habit of bureaucratism resulting from the rolling party's position, and broke people's democracy. In order to maintain the purity of the revolution, Mao Zedong took a lot of measures, rectification as the chief way, but the effect was not obvious, together with the complex international situation, Mao Zedong over-estimated the situation of bureaucratism, which linked to the mistake of expansion of class struggle, and finally resulted in the Cultural Revolution that plunged the country into turmoil which was launched to save the Party and the country from the danger of being changed into the capitalism. The conclusion of the experiences and lessons of Mao Zedong's efforts in the fight against anti-bureaucratism is important for our current anti-bureaucratism work. The sparkling parts of his anti-bureaucratism theory, such as valuing political education and the supervision of the masses and the ""three important styles of work"", still remains in the current socialist core value system. But simply taking the ways of ideological and political education and large-scale of mass movement would never eradicate the bureaucratism, structural reforms is the only way",1869953208,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhao, Ling LingZhaoLingLingZhao, Ling Ling", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315473301 , 70615242 , 189128 , 10526252 , 10526252", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,, Chinese, Chinese,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869953208?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAI10526252 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+research+on+mao+zedong%27s+anti-bureaucratism+theory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhao%2C+Ling+Ling&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.716764641,0.959682919,433,Left,communism/socialism,Great leap forward movement,Great leap forward movement research in shaanxi province,"Translation from original language as provided by author From 1958 to 1960, the Communist Party continued criticism of 1956 of opposition to a risky policy incorrectly, which launched the large scale ""great leap forward"" campaign throughout the national territory with a global failure. As one of the largest provinces in Northwest of China, Shaanxi Province started the ""great leap forward"" campaign under the leadership of the Party Central Committee in 1958. The campaign was a very ""left"" movement of the line, and its range spread to agriculture, industry, science, education, health and other fields, eventually, Shaanxi's economic development had brought great losses. At present, the research of Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" campaign is still relatively weak and is not a system. So study for it in-depth, from which sum up experiences and learned, we can not only have a very important academic value and theoretical significance, but also have very important practical significance for this stage of development of socialist modernization construction in Shaanxi Province. Overall, this article is divided into six parts. The first part is introduction. This section mainly discusses the background and significance of the subject. Through the analysis of research status at home and abroad, the author takes a certain amount of research method so as to form their own way of research. The second part is about the age of launching Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"". This is primarily an analysis of both international and domestic reasons .That international reasons are mainly capitalism proposed rehabilitation and the Premier of the State of the US strategy and the domestic reasons are mainly social reason and opposition to a risky policy. The third part is the historical development of Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"" movement. The article considers the history of the development of Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" are in general consistent with the country, and it can be divided into four stages, which include the launching phase from November 1957 to April 1958, the climax stage from May to December in 1958, 1959 in stage of continuing leap stage, 1960 in the ""sick"" leap stage and terminates. The fourth part is the main contents and main features of Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"" movement. This part is on the basis of a thorough analysis of Shaanxi Province's ""great leap forward"" movement, in order to summarize it and come to the main character. Thinking of this article, Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" campaign is mainly in the areas of agriculture, industry and science as well as culture and public health. Agricultural aspects of the ""great leap forward"" mainly highlight the performance of water conservancy construction, satellite and high yield people's communization movement. Industries include all people making iron and steel movement and local industry sprouted. Culture and public health aspects of science and education, include literacy campaigns, health education, inter alia ""four pests"" and so on. The fifth part is about the serious consequences and lessons of Shaanxi Province ""great leap forward"" movement. Serious consequences are mainly in the economic imbalance in the national economy, lack of democracy in political; people should note on the economic objective laws of economic development, as well as on the construction of democratic politics.

It analyzes four historical moments that illustrate the prison's revivification as a democratic institution. The first chapter reconstructs the legal culture that preceded Leavenworth and the competing ideas of democratic justice that emerged from the context of Bleeding Kansas, and produced four federal prisons and one state institution. The second chapter argues that the congenital formation of Leavenworth and Fort Leavenworth military prison as sites for the punishment of Native Americans continued the US Indian Wars in a new form. The chapter examines Leavenworth's role in the relocation of Indian Territory from Kansas to Oklahoma, and in the production of Native criminality. The third chapter argues that Leavenworth was part of a state pedagogical project that crossed the interconnected social landscapes of the prison's inside and outside. The chapter examines the relationship between prisons, citizens, and race through three interconnected social movements imprisoned for espionage during WWI as federal prisons became segregated institutions. The removal and reattachment of citizenship to the body is explored through resistances to civil death among the 99 members of the Industrial Workers of the World, 62 members of the Black 24 th Infantry, and 3 central figures in the Mexican Revolution. The next chapter focuses on the history of prison litigation at Leavenworth and the success of ""jailhouse lawyers"" in drawing national attention to Leavenworth's position as ""the next Attica,"" and in forcing the federal Bureau of Prisons to agree to close Leavenworth in 1974â€”a decision that was reversed within one year, as Leavenworth assumed a new role within the federal system as the home of federal habeas law. The chapter examines Leavenworth's place in a new legal framework of preemptive prosecution, total solitary confinement, and behavior modification. The epilogue considers Leavenworth's place in the global war on tenor, as the proposed ""home"" for GITMO detainees. It suggests that practices of torture reflect practices within US prisons and that a more complicated theory of prisons and democracy is necessary.",898367657,,Dissertations & Theses," Benson, Sara M.BensonM.SaraBenson, Sara M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2485218941 , 63954051 , 66569 , 9781124967790 , 3480348 , 3480348", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898367657?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology",," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," American studies , Law , Political science , Criminology"," Social sciences , Bleeding Kansas , Critical race and legal studies , Kansas , Law and society - prison law , Leavenworth Penitentiary , Legal culture , Prisons , Punishment , Slavery , United States , War on Terror",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+prison+of+democracy%3A++US+legal+culture+and+the+idea+of+Leavenworth+Penitentiary&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Benson%2C+Sara+M.&amp;isbn=9781124967790&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.420005913,0.929907156,228,Left,communism/socialism,Communist Party of Taiwan,The japanese occuption period of the communist party of taiwan,"Translation from original language as provided by author The Communist Party of Taiwan (TCP for short) played an important role in the history of Taiwan national movement. It was the most radical revolution organization of Taiwan. Under the help of the Communist International, Communist Party of Japan and Communist Party of China, The TCP was founded in shanghai on April 15, 1928. Later it came to Taiwan, and attracted the Taiwan Culture Association and Taiwan Peasant's Organization. Unfortunately, the TCP was destroyed by colonial police of Japanese on June of 1931, which caused the vacuum time of Taiwan national movement. The TCP was not mature. As a national branch of the Japanese Communist Party, It was the result of the communist international pushing forward the world revolution. After the rebuilt of TCP, the readers had different opinion about the revolution circumstances as a result of the impact of the Communist International, there was a debate between Xie xuehong who insisted the confederative route and Wang wande who insisted the class conflict, but the substance of their contest was about revolution route and tactics not the factional. They fought for leadership and control of TCP, which caused the fission of the external organizations. It was not good for the development of Taiwan national movement, and also made TCP be in trouble. The TCP lacked the social foundation and the leaders were not enough mature, which were the fundamental cause of TCP's defeat. Although the time of TCP was only 3 years, it had the important meaning to Taiwan people opposing the imperialism and colonialism. The meaning of ""the national independence of Taiwan"" mentioned by TCP's party platform is letting Taiwan be independent from the colonialism of Japan. As one of the central leaders of TCP, Xie xuehong who be trained by the Communist International bended herself to the career of Taiwan's liberation from Japan not Taiwan's independence from china.

The first-generation leaders' group headed by Mao Zedong has made instructive exploration on the progress of socialism which formed a solid foundation for the CCP's outlook on scientific development both in theory and practice. The international socialist movement and the development of foreign capitalism have provided both beneficial experience and lessons for us resulting in the party's idea of development in the 90s. Scientific development constitutes the essence and core of the idea. The 90's outlook answers the three elementary questions of why we should develop, where the power of development locates and the goal of development. During the prolong reform of China, Deng Xiaoping put forward a series of opinions about the problems of development. These opinions were passed on to the third-generation leader's group headed by Jiang Zemin. The success of the 90's economic development was rooted from their insisting and implementing such outlook of development.The 90's development strategy of our party was a detailed demonstration of the idea on scientific development. Den Xiaoping's strategic theory of development dealt with the goal of development, the path for development and the sustaining and comprehensiveness of development. The third-generation leaders' group centered by Jang Zemin further enhanced and implemented the outlook on scientific development primarily by way of reforming economy, implementing the strategy of sustaining development, pushing forward the country's administration under law enforcement and political civilization, enhancing the country's comprehensive strength by developing education and science. The national economy's health and steady growth was greatly propelled with these measures taken.The 90's idea on development is of great significance. First and foremost, it is the inheritance and innovation of the Marxism. Secondly, it provides theoretical guidance for the China-featured socialist construction. In addition, it endows the fourth-generation leaders' group with theoretical basis. Though the 90's idea on development has proved a great success in leading China's socialist practice, it caused several social problems signifying the limit of the party's idea on development. In the 90s, the party's adhering to the socialist direction of development is the fundamental source for the success of China's socialist",1868796848,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, Zhu QingChenQingZhuChen, Zhu Qing", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314548711 , 70613842 , 189128 , 10361547 , 10361547", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868796848?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10361547 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+scientific+development+ideas+of+the+chinese+communist+party+in+the+1990s+of+the+20st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Zhu+Qing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.861266941,0.909504487,223,Left,communism/socialism,"CPC, Marxism, proletariat revolutio",Study on women's aid work in war of deng yingchao in anti-japanese war,"Translation from original language as provided by author Deng Yingchao (1904-1992),born in Nanning of Guangxi,originally from Guangshan of Henan,is an outstanding proletariat revolutionist and great politician of China,is a famous social activist and faithful Marxist of CPC,is a pioneer and brilliant leader of the Chinese Women's liberation movement and the international progress women movement.In her early days,Deng Yingchao actively devoted herself to the Chinese Women's liberation movement and laid a solid foundation to direct women to take part in the Anti-Japanese War.

The first half explains the demise of the USSR and its East European allies in terms of their insertion into a changing global environment. A Marxist explanation is given of the economic and social decay of East European â€˜Communismâ€™ in general and of East Germany in particular. The latter state was characterized by two fundamental contradictions. The first was between its economic nationalist form and the developing internationalization of the world economy. The second was between the attractive power of the economically superior West and the GDRâ€™s dependence upon the USSR. East Germanyâ€™s rulers, despite being uniquely grateful for Moscowâ€™s â€˜bear hugâ€™, were also tempted to embrace the West. The East German economy became ever more entangled with and dependent upon Western businesses and states. Albeit to a lesser extent than their counterparts in Poland and Hungary, East Germanyâ€™s rulers found themselves seduced by the superior technologies, commodities, and economic structures of the West. They were torn between loyalty to orthodox Communism and to Moscow, and a tacit awareness of Western economic superiority. This contradiction was compounded when, under Gorbachev, the Kremlin ceased to be identified with Communist orthodoxy. The second half of the thesis is devoted to the revolution itself. The interaction between the regimeâ€™s reaction to the developing crisis and the mobilization of protest is examined. Among the questions addressed are why the SED was unable to prevent mass emigration and why the security forces were unable to crush the protests. In the context of a narrative of the protest movement three aspects are given particular attention. The first is the transformation of society. Over the course of some five months of weekly demonstrations in which millions participated, political institutions were transformed as well as other core features of social and political behaviour. Secondly, the importance of conscious deliberation, debate and strategy is emphasized. Detailed consideration is made of how people became conscious of the developing national crisis, how they scented the opportunity to protest, and how they acted to effect political change. Thirdly, the question of why a divergence developed between the â€˜Citizensâ€™ Movementâ€™ and the rest of the movement is addressed. In particular the radicalization of the mass movement is examined, as are the strategies of the Citizens Movement and of the regime. Finally, the history of the overthrow of the forces of the old regime is narrated, culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall.",1774183298,,Dissertations & Theses," Dale, GarethDaleGarethDale, Gareth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989178761 , 102694062 , 101309 , 10029184 , 10029184 , http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/1225", Dissertation/Thesis,1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774183298?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/1225 , (UMI)AAI10029184 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+east+german+revolution+of+1989&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dale%2C+Gareth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.908090093,0.922429042,3372,Mixed,communism/socialism,"Soldiers, Pacifists, and Secret Agents: Militarization and the Cold War Public Arena","Soldiers, pacifists, and secret agents: Militarization and the Cold War public arena","â€œSoldiers, Pacifists, and Secret Agents: Militarization and the Cold War Public Arenaâ€ documents the emergence of the National Security State from the New Deal period through the Bay of Pigs. The cultural and political policies of the New Deal era embraced the public arena as a site of administrative contact; the state's entanglements in public culture intensified with mobilization for WWII and the ensuing Cold War, placing new limits on political debate and acceptable forms of dissent in the wake of the labor-based and multi-racial social movements of the 1930s. These new entanglements, however, also generated historically-significant alternative press and media formations, such as Marzani &amp; Munsell Press, the Waldport Fine Arts Project, Pacifica Radio, and City Lights Books. In many instances, the foundational figures of these cultural formations emerged directly out of the swiftly consolidating military structure to produce compelling and sustained critiques of U.S. world-ordering ambition which extended over the fields of journalistic, visual, literary and radio culture. Publicly vilified through various forms of incarceration and legal harassment, intellectuals and artists associated with the Office of Strategic Services and Civilian Public Service System generated an extended critical genealogy of U.S. militarism, offering oppositional visions of democracy, racial justice, sexuality and anti-colonialism at the height of Cold War cultural repression. Working collaboratively with intellectuals in other national theaters, the principle figures of this project facilitated several transnational textual economiesâ€”constellated through sites such as pre-Soviet Cubaâ€”which rejected the global bifurcations of Cold War geopolitics and its attendant forms of political subjecthood. Collectively, they attempted to imagine a truly democratic world in which political demands would not be confined to the severely compromised public arenas of national states. Placing their work at the center of wartime and Cold War intellectual history challenges conventional portrayals of Truman-McCarthyism as a period of intellectual ruination, thereby allowing us to reconstruct a more cohesive genealogy of alternative political culture across the traditional â€œOldâ€ and â€œNewâ€ Left divide.

Two of the moments discussed here took place when Korea was a colony of Japan: a so-called â€œconspiracy caseâ€ in 1911 and the 1919 independence movement. The other two moments transpired in the context of the Cold War when Korean orphans and Korean exchange students came to the United States in the 1950s. In recounting these stories, I seek, not so much to chronicle state actions or the work of formal policy-makers but rather to analyze the experiences of Americans and Koreans who encountered each other outside the circles of foreign policy elites and the effects of those encounters. I argue that the interplay of perceptions, people , and official and unofficial policy can be seen in the work of people such as missionaries, mission board members, Korean expatriates, adoptive parents, social workers, journalists, and academics who tried to bind Americans and Koreans through empathetic connections. They did so by portraying Koreans as Christian converts, as supporters of democracy and democratic ideals, and as people embracing western or American cultural norms, including language, schooling, dress, and morals. In molding American perceptions of Koreans, the actors in this dissertation attempted to influence U.S. and Korean relations. They did not always succeed in their goals but, through their endeavors, they facilitated policy discussions, forged ties between the United States and Korea, and began to break down cultural barriers between Koreans and Americans.",903972769,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, HannahKimHannahKim, Hannah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2511652291 , 65581931 , 66569 , 9781124965680 , 3478737 , 3478737", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/903972769?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," History , American history , Modern history , International Relations"," Social sciences , Cold War , Intercountry adoption-Korea , International adoption , Korea , Korea - Japanese colony , Korean independence movement , Protestant missions , Protestant missions - Korea , U.S.-Korea foreign relations , United States-Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ties+that+bind%3A+People%2C+policy%2C+and+perception+in+U.S.-Korean+relations%2C+1905%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Hannah&amp;isbn=9781124965680&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.610092676,0.99174224,457,Left,decolonization,SNCC,"Freedom is Indivisible: The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Cold War Politics, and International Liberation Movements","This transnational history analyzes the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), its relationship with international liberation struggles, and the place of Cold War politics in defining civil rights from 1960 through the early 1970s. Most accounts of SNCC focus on the organization's grassroots work throughout the American South; on voter registration and nonviolent direct action; and on the organization's later turn to Black Power. Yet SNCC's April 1960 founding conference also emphasized solidarity with international struggles, and my work seeks to restore the organization's broad vision to scholarly attention. I place SNCC's creation within the context of worldwide decolonization movements and independence struggles, arguing that these international shifts were crucial to SNCC's formation. My project highlights the development of SNCC's Cold War critique of U.S. racial practices as part of the organization's push for civil and human rights. SNCC connected many of its activities in the American South â€“ the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project, for example â€“ with international ideas and movements, and with the potential of Cold War damage to the United States if the country did not create and enforce an America that reflected its proclaimed global values. My project also reveals how decolonization and African independence defined SNCC's domestic civil rights fight. SNCC sought inspiration and practical strategies from struggles in Ghana, Guinea, South Africa, and elsewhere, and I show how SNCC in turn served as a resource for political movements outside the United States. Even as members devoted great energy to domestic fights for political, social, and economic justice, SNCC also turned outward, connecting racial discrimination in the United States to the treatment of people of color throughout the world. SNCC leaders linked global transformations to changes in the United States, and its organizers and writers emphasized the parallels between domestic racism and colonialism abroad. By 1966, organization leaders called for a Third World alliance to unite black Americans with colonized Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans, forging a link between their own civil rights movement and international liberation struggles. Throughout the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, SNCC activists increased their identification with African liberation struggles and independence movements throughout the Third World, realizing the ""indivisible nature"" of the global struggles against racism, colonialism, and apartheid. By tracing the internal debates, public pronouncements, and changing organizing strategies that defined this leading civil rights organization, my dissertation fills a critical historical gap. Following scholars such as Mary Dudziak, James Meriwether, Brenda Gayle Plummer, and Penny Von Eschen, who have shown how international connections defined earlier civil rights efforts, and building upon pioneering histories of SNCC by Clayborne Carson and others, I argue that international currents proved critical to SNCC's fight for domestic civil rights and global human rights. My work is part of larger effort by a number of scholars, remapping the chronology and geography of one of the most profound moments in American history. An intellectual, social, and political history of a key decade in United States and world history, my dissertation contends that SNCC demanded social change within and beyond the borders of the United States, and that a better understanding of SNCC furthers the internationalization of U.S. history, and a new retelling of the Black freedom struggle.",884584356,,Dissertations & Theses," Wood, Julia ErinWoodErinJuliaWood, Julia Erin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2431564871 , 63674621 , 66569 , 9781124806822 , 3467852 , 3467852", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884584356?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," African American Studies , American studies , Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Civil rights movement , Cold War , Decolonization , Human rights , Liberation movements , Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Freedom+is+Indivisible%3A+The+Student+Nonviolent+Coordinating+Committee+%28SNCC%29%2C+Cold+War+Politics%2C+and+International+Liberation+Movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wood%2C+Julia+Erin&amp;isbn=9781124806822&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.220864645,0.986052099,1409,Left,decolonization,Peace Corps and 1960s movement cultures,"The point of the lance: Gender, development, and the 1960s Peace Corps","This dissertation argues that in its founding and iconic decade, the 1960s Peace Corps embodied and disseminated modernization theory, formulating fantasies that obscured the contradiction between the United States' anti-colonial rhetoric and its drive to secure global hegemony. By presenting economic modernization and development as an opportunity for third world nations to assert their national masculinity (throwing over both passive, indigenous selves and ancient, matriarchal societies) and thus enter into a global brotherhood of nations, the Peace Corps and its volunteers helped paint the United States as an altruistic partner in anti-imperialist struggles for self-determination. Using gender theory and critical development studies frameworks to analyze policy and archival documents, volunteer memoirs, popular novels, oral history interviews, and other cultural texts, this dissertation analyzes the Peace Corps' vision of worldwide modernization as it appeared in agency rhetoric, iconography, and policy; in encounters between volunteers and people in the countries where they served; and in the social movements that emerged to challenge U.S. power as the decade progressed. Chapters 1 and 2 explore Peace Corps discourses of liberal development and rugged altruism in the agency's early years. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 trace the connections between the Peace Corps and 1960s movement cultures. In these chapters, I consider how women volunteers imagined their relationship to both frontier masculinity and feminism as well as how modernization discourses pioneered by the Peace Corps shaped the civil rights, Black Power, and antiwar movements.

Taiwan New Cinema configures the different political formations of Taiwanese culture, and deals with the historical, social and cultural relations between Taiwanese culture and other cultures such as Mainland Chinese, American and Japanese. I argue that Taiwan New Cinema has become a vital cultural space wherein questions of national borders and identities are being renegotiated. This thesis will investigate Taiwan New Cinema and its historical and cultural phenomena from three directions. First, it aims to develop an understanding of constructed national identities by examining how Taiwanese history has been written within the Taiwan New Cinema movement and by considering Taiwan cinema in the light of the concept of national cinema. Part 1 proposes that Taiwan New Cinema is the site of a dynamic contestation in the representation of Chinese exile, shifting from a monumental style aimed at encouraging a sense of collective identity to a more self-reflexive and critical approach. Second, this dissertation attempts to reevaluate domestic genres by mapping the spaces culturally occupied by selected new wave film texts produced to challenge, in various ways, the dominant realist aesthetics. Part 2 argues that Taiwan New Cinema tackles the issue of American neocolonialism by exploring the significance of popular genre in Taiwan, especially the effects of the Cold War on Taiwan society. Third, this dissertation is concerned with the way in which postcolonial discourse is inscribed in Taiwan New Cinema. Since the 1990s, there have been transnational trends in deploying Taiwan New Cinema as a site of cultural translation for addressing postcolonial subjects or responses to Japanese contemporary culture. Part 3 reveals a diverse landscape in film narrative, subject matter and cinematic style in relation to an attempt to reimagine the colonial past.",1784059936,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Wan-JuiWangWan-JuiWang, Wan-Jui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017532631 , 93841502 , 101309 , U618665 , U618665 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/14925", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784059936?accountid=14496, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0459 Communication, Communication," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/14925 , (UMI)AAIU618665 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crossing+borders+in+taiwan+new+cinema%3A+historiography%2C+popularity%2C+postcoloniality&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Wan-Jui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.367396657,0.944386656,2806,Left,decolonization,Hindu nationalist movement,(De)secularizing the nation: Global modernity and the politics of Hindu nationalism,"The modern narrative of progress and reason that premised itself on the inevitability of the regression of religion from public/political life gives rise to a certain amount of incredulity in the observation that religion is back in the reckoning in international politics. Rather than seeing this recent intensification of religious passions, both in the East and the West as the sign of an incomplete modernity that had not fully blossomed worldwide, scholars now increasingly question the inevitability of secularization. Whether it is those who ask if the rise of religious nationalisms constitutes a new source of conflict in the post-cold war world, or those who now question the very principle of â€˜secularismâ€™ as a viable historical-political institutionalization of modernity in a post-modern world, the complex interconnections and contradictions between the worldwide rise of religious nationalisms, and the global project of modernity are becoming increasingly visible and troubling. Examining the discursive intervention of the Hindu nationalist movement into the contemporary political debate in India, this dissertation explores the renegotiation of national identity in the face of liberalization and globalization. Looking at religion as a symbolic (and postcolonial) resource for the reclaiming of national â€˜particularityâ€™ and â€˜authenticityâ€™, I argue that even though most religious nationalisms present themselves as 'traditional' responses to the â€˜problems of modernityâ€™, contemporary religious nationalisms remain linked to modernity, and the modernist project, in integral ways. Hence, the binary dichotomy between secularism/fundamentalism used to frame the modern/pre-modern dichotomy remains problematic, not simply because it usually and increasingly constructs an orientalist Western/non-Western (First world/Third world) framework, but because it fails to acknowledge these complex interconnections between religious nationalisms and modernity. Locating the contemporary emergence of Hindu nationalism in India within a larger context of the economic and social dislocations caused by failed developmentalist projects and late capitalism, and the new discontents generated through the more recent adoption of neoliberal economic policies by the Indian state, the dissertation documents how the Hindu nationalist movement works on the existing discursive terrain (popular understandings of â€˜Indian secularismâ€™ and the â€˜Indian nationâ€™) to create new meanings and a new common-sense.",304509060,,Dissertations & Theses," Biswas, ShampaBiswasShampaBiswas, Shampa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730221721 , 30399771 , 66569 , 9780599522565 , 0599522569 , 9950276 , 9950276", Dissertation/Thesis,1999," 9780599522565 , 0599522569", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304509060?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0318 Religion , 0332 History"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0318 Religion , 0332 History"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0318 Religion , 0332 History",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0318 Religion , 0332 History"," International law , International relations , Religion , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Globalization , Hindu , India , Modernity , Nationalism , Politics , Religion , Secularization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%28De%29secularizing+the+nation%3A++Global+modernity+and+the+politics+of+Hindu+nationalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Biswas%2C+Shampa&amp;isbn=9780599522565&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.811486605,0.921234082,587,Left,decolonization,East Pakistan/Bangladesh's student movements,"Beyond liberation: Students, space, and the state in East Pakistan/Bangladesh 1952-1990","This dissertation examines the history of East Pakistan/Bangladesh's student movements in the postcolonial period. The principal argument is that the major student mobilizations of Dhaka University are evidence of an active student engagement with shared symbols and rituals across time and that the campus space itself has served as the linchpin of this movement culture. The category of ""student"" developed into a distinct political class that was deeply tied to a concept of local place in the campus; however, the idea of ""student"" as a collective identity also provided a means of ideological engagement with a globally imagined community of ""students."" Thus, this manuscript examines the case study of student mobilizations at Dhaka University in various geographic scales, demonstrating the levels of local, national and global as complementary and interdependent components of social movement culture.

This study reveals the development of a particular type of contentious student activism was driven by private frustrations, grievances and intellectual concerns, and that led to particular forms of collective action that became institutionalized in two ways: (1) as a repertoire relied on by students; and (2) more generally, as a culturally acceptable mode of expressing opposition. However, the development of student's political consciousness did not reflect only political grievances and frustrations. Student activism was the result of many different resources and opportunities. To be successful, student movements required both the physical and conceptual space in which they could construct political opposition. This dissertation challenges the assumption that free spaces must always be local, free and participated in by groups from below. Free spaces may be as important for highly-visible privileged groups as they are for an invisible subaltern. This may force activists to seek free spaces in places far from local settings supported by transnational actors and social networks. This study finds this phenomenon in fields as different as the anti-European anti-colonial student movements of the 1920s to the post Indonesian independence movements of the 1950s down to the present. By focusing on the claims and contentious identities of the study movement and of the student movements, this study reorients the study of Indonesian student activism from analysis of protest to the analysis of the specific spaces created through their reliance on the powerful narratives that shaped each decade of student activism.",1018715679,,Dissertations & Theses," Sapiie, StephanieSapiieStephanieSapiie, Stephanie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2679436111 , 68147552 , 66569 , 9781267346896 , 3508858 , 3508858", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018715679?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0615 Political science , 0745 Higher education"," Asian Studies , Pacific Rim Studies , Political science , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education , Collective identity , Indonesia , Political activism , University students , West Java",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Free+spaces%2C+collective+identity+and+political+consciousness%3A+Student+activism+and+repression+on+West+Java%2C+Indonesia%2C+1920%E2%80%931979&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sapiie%2C+Stephanie&amp;isbn=9781267346896&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.18738248,0.916637178,2948,Left,decolonization,women  in anti-colonial liberation movements,"Gender and the German autumn: The representation of terrorism and the female terrorist in social discourses, literature and film","In the 1970s in Germany, an urban guerilla movement arose following the decline of the student movement and parallel to the women's movement. The emergence of armed resistance groups was shaped by international anti-colonial liberation movements, the historical exigencies of postwar Germany, and in particular Germany's National Socialist past. One aspect of the phenomenon of armed resistance in Germany is that at least half the members of underground groups were women, a fact that is echoed in the over-abundant figure of the female terrorist in social discourses, literature and film of the 1970s and early 1980s. This study is a reading of this historical fact, the often hysterical fascination it elicited, and the ways in which individual and political identities among the spectrum of the left and the women's movement were constructed in relation to the figure of the female terrorist. This figure had an important ideological function in which the politics of the new German nation, the New Left, and feminism in relation to gender and German history can be read. Through a formal analysis of specific representations, I show how fears of and fantasies about terrorism and in particular the female terrorist addressed underlying social, political and individual conflicts particular to this generation of political activists. Terrorism raised points of doubt, contention, and anxiety relating to issues that preoccupied the 68 generation: guilt and atonement for the National Socialist past, alternatives to the nuclear family and changing gender roles, and the role of the new media in transmitting message about these issues. The object of this study is an elusive phantom of various discourses (social, political and legal texts, popular culture, film, and literature) but also a group of historical subjects whom I approach in a final chapter that focuses on autobiographical writings and oral interviews with women who were involved in the urban guerilla groups Bewegung 2.

My thesis breaks new ground in that it attempts to place the story of Tunisian veterans in the wider global context of the World Wars and decolonization. Earlier studies of Tunisian veterans, while comprehensive in some aspects, limit their inquiry to a specifically Tunisian context. My research into recently-released French archives documenting Tunisian veterans in the 1950s also contributes to the importance of my thesis. Whereas most Tunisian historians have considered the veterans as ""collaborators"" with the French, my research indicates that such generalizations simply do not describe the complex relationship between the veterans and French colonial rule. Rather, I argue that veterans participated in and, in some cases, seem to have organized armed resistance to French rule. In contrast to similar research on African veterans from French Equatorial Africa (AOF), my research on North African veterans reveals that the political roles open to Tunisian veterans in the post-independence period were few and far between, unlike the situation in the Ivory Coast or Mali. Finally, my limited interviews with Tunisian veterans and my use of interviews transcribed by other Tunisian scholars provide unique insights as to how veterans themselves interpreted the wartime and post-war environment. The introduction functions as an historiographical overview positioning Tunisian veterans within the wider context of veterans' movements in France, North Africa, and elsewhere. Specifically, I pose the question of why Tunisian veterans did not become politicized as did other Arab veterans (notably in Iraq and Morocco). The first chapter deals with the establishment of the French Protectorate in Tunisia and the First World War. I explore the depth of pan-Islamic and pro-Ottoman sympathies among the troops, as well as the experience of Tunisian troops in German prisoner-of-war camps. The second chapter deals with the aftermath of the First World War and the halting efforts to define social benefits for the veterans. The veterans and their descendants use their correspondence with the French administration to negotiate benefits on the basis of their wartime sacrifices. The third chapter deals with the Second World War and the enormous upheaval of the French defeat in 1940. I use an appeal by Marshal PÃ©tain and a Free French Franco-Arabic military journal Al-Nasr , published from 1943-1946, to detail the intense French propaganda efforts to retain the loyalty of Muslim soldiers. The fourth chapter details belated French efforts to reinvigorate their policies towards the veterans, while exploring the increased militancy of some veterans as French power waned in the late 1950s. The fifth chapter deals with the post-independence period (1956-Present) and describes how Tunisian veterans were pushed to the margins of historical memory (both in France and in Tunisia). The chapter ends with a discussion of how and why the veterans have once again emerged as a potent symbol for national unity and pride in both France and Tunisia in recent years.",305338363,,Dissertations & Theses," DeGeorges, Thomas PatrickDeGeorgesPatrickThomasDeGeorges, Thomas Patrick", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1158516551 , 34018301 , 66569 , 9780542692284 , 3217711 , 3217711", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,9.78E+12, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305338363?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history"," Middle Eastern history , European history"," Social sciences , Colonialism , France , Tunisian , Veterans , World War I , World War II",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+bitter+homecoming%3A+Tunisian+veterans+of+the+first+and+second+world+wars&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DeGeorges%2C+Thomas+Patrick&amp;isbn=9780542692284&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.819714378,0.998801311,1111,Left,education,Taiwanese musical method,"The KodÃ¡ly method in Taiwan: Its introduction and adaptation to elementary music education, 1987â€“2000","The purpose of this study was to examine the introduction and adaptation of the KodÃ¡ly method in Taiwan through the year 2000, with special emphasis on elementary music education. Elementary music education in Taiwan evolved through five major periods. The influences came from the Netherlands, Spain, Ming/Qing China, Japan, and the Republic of China. The Taiwan democratization movement helped to pave the way for acceptance of new international music education methods. The KodÃ¡ly method arrived in Taiwan during a democratic era: the 1980s. This was a period of dramatic social changes and major reforms in elementary education. This Hungarian method came to Taiwan through North America. Although the method was introduced by several foreign KodÃ¡ly teachers it had little influence until several foreign-trained Taiwanese KodÃ¡ly teachers cooperated to promote the method through the Taiwan KodÃ¡ly Society (TICS) and several teacher in-service training programs. As a result, the method became better known among elementary music educators than before, but it was still not widely accepted. KodÃ¡ly enthusiasts faced many challenges in Taiwan, and the adaptation of the KodÃ¡ly method there has been difficult. The challenges were similar to those faced by other international music educators when introducing the method to their countries. Among other problems, inadequate collaboration with foreign music educators and insufficient participation in international events resulted in a partial understanding of the KodÃ¡ly method on the part of Taiwanese music educators. The lack of governmental support contributed to the lack of general acceptance in Taiwan as well. Despite the problems encountered, the KodÃ¡ly method would seem to be highly suitable for teaching indigenous folk music because it relies on movable- do systems, something it shares with traditional music teaching techniques. It could be adapted as the framework to develop an elementary music education system for Taiwan. The incorporation of traditional tools used to teach Taiwanese indigenous folk music could add authenticity and provide diversity in learning music.",304685866,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Ying-ShuLiuYing-ShuLiu, Ying-Shu", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472137171 , 39056491 , 66569 , 9780549453154 , 3300666 , 3300666", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304685866?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education"," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education"," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education",," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education"," Music , Music education , Elementary education"," Communication and the arts , Education , Adaptation , China , Elementary , Introduction , Kodaly method , Music education , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Kod%C3%A1ly+method+in+Taiwan%3A+Its+introduction+and+adaptation%0Ato+elementary+music+education%2C+1987%E2%80%932000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Ying-Shu&amp;isbn=9780549453154&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.7684452,0.9959485,809,Left,education,Argentenian and Chilean student movements,Building Counter-Power: A comparative study of student movements in Argentina and in Chile at the turn of the 21st century,"This project provides a comparative cross-national study of high school and university student power during the last decades in Argentina and Chile to assess the extent to which there is something specific about students vis-Ã -vis other social movements. The study analyzes contentious events to assess their main demands and repertoires of contention, their relations within a complex network of social and political organizations, generational continuities, and ruptures between student movements. Beginning with a critique of the individualistic and behavioral focus on social movement power, the study scrutinizes at the operation of social forces and institutional practices that eliminate overt conflict form the public agenda, and finds that students play distinctive roles in bringing previously unarticulated issues into explicit contention. Through a combined method approach, the study shows that; a) generational references and generational boundary-making are a paramount feature of student mobilization in the present; b) studentÂ´s identities have concrete effects on their selection of tactics and alliance-building; c) though students are impacted by process of global circulation of ideas, these are always mediated by the historical and contextual characteristics of conflicts; d) when students move outwards of the education system to make non-student demands, this process yields a thickening of social networks and social alliances. The comparison between Chile and Argentina shows that both the institutional arrangements of the existent educational systems and the nature of capitalism in both countries are fundamental elements for understanding the differences in terms of a) the perceived threat by authorizes, b) the degree of visibility and public support and c) the relative leverage exercised by student movements in both countries. Educational systems where the state plays a central role in regulation, management, delivery and financing have greater capacity to grant concessions and negotiate with students, avoiding ongoing escalation of conflicts.",1767658261,,Dissertations & Theses," Gonzalez Vaillant, GabrielaGonzalez VaillantGabrielaGonzalez Vaillant, Gabriela", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3961130561 , 98745902 , 66569 , 9781339502632 , 10017534 , 10017534", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767658261?accountid=14496," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0626 Sociology"," Education Policy , Latin American Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , Education , Argentina , Chile , Countentious politics , Leverage , Students movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+Counter-Power%3A+A+comparative+study+of+student+movements+in+Argentina+and+in+Chile+at+the+turn+of+the+21st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gonzalez+Vaillant%2C+Gabriela&amp;isbn=9781339502632&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.886757857,0.979836601,3340,Left,education,popular education in the Mission,The role of *education in strengthening social movements: A case study of the Mission Anti -Displacement Coalition in San Francisco,"This research contributes to social science theory about uses of education in social movements, addressing a theoretical gap regarding strengthening existing social movements. Using a theoretical framework that recognizes the role of schooling in reproducing oppressive society, I examine popular educational processes as a tool to change society, focusing on how education might help a social movement to persist and also to strengthen under conditions of change. My theoretical framework includes critical social theory, critical pedagogy and literature on social movements, race, colonialism, and social transformation. Social movements can be strengthened by increasing amount and quality of participation; both can be improved through popular education processes. Such education is the process of acquiring information, being exposed to and understanding new ideas, being able to critically evaluate information, events or experiences with respect to historical conditions and structural forces, and learning the tools to learn. It also includes processes that make re-evaluation of new situations possible. Processes of re-evaluation strengthen social movements by creating possibilities for effective responses to larger social forces. This study is a participant observation ethnography of uses of popular education in strengthening an urban social movement concerning land use: the Mission Anti-displacement Coalition (MAC). This small geographic urban community was impacted not only by the City of San Francisco, but also by larger global forces and historical processes of colonization. MAC addressed these impacts through educational processes to strengthen itself as a social movement by improving the quality of participation. I assessed quality of participation as: more and better engagement; increased effectiveness of movement organization or structure; increased understanding of current problems; and increased policy and strategy effectiveness. This study showed that history is crucial to understanding current conditions of a local community. Organizers in MAC saw the role of social movements as transforming not just reforming society, and education helped achieve this goal. Listening was a significant popular educational process that helped strengthen social movements resulting in consciousness raising and healing from oppression. Eliminating racism was central to the MAC's work in transforming society, and was advanced by the popular educational listening practices.",305031298,,Dissertations & Theses," Selig, Christine ElizabethSeligElizabethChristineSelig, Christine Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1014307861 , 17941201 , 66569 , 9780542343698 , 054234369X , 3190865 , 3190865", Dissertation/Thesis,2005," 9780542343698 , 054234369X", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305031298?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," Educational sociology , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Urban planning , Area planning & development"," Social sciences , Education , California , Education , Land use , Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition , San Francisco , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of++*education+in+strengthening+social+movements%3A+A+case+study+of+the+Mission+Anti+-Displacement+Coalition+in+San+Francisco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Selig%2C+Christine+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780542343698&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.482055924,0.977115306,1130,Left,education,open-education movement in Sub-Saharan Africa,A critical analysis of the open educational resources (oer) movement in the higher education sector in sub-saharan africa,"This study critically analysed three Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa to help establish: What were the origins of the OER Movement?Â  How has it evolved?Â  What was the current state of the OER Movement a) globally; and b) in Sub-Saharan Africa? What were the key emerging issues facing the OER Movement generally and did these issues find commonality in the Sub-Saharan African OER Movement? What was the role of the OER Movement in supporting the Higher Education sector in Sub-Saharan Africa? In order to effectively decode the OER phenomenon â€“ through the lens of three case studies â€“ this research adopted qualitative research methods since these better enabled the researcher to understand, analyse and report the social and cultural contexts within which the OER initiatives were being implemented. The key findings of the research support the view that a shift in thinking is required in the way Higher Education is provided in Sub-Saharan Africa and that elements of the global OER Movement may be able to catalyse this shift. Further, this will need to be supported by adequate planning and resource provision, without which the ability of countries, institutions, educators and, indeed, the learners themselves, to benefit from OER strategies, will be severely curtailed. This stud also suggests that there is a need for further research into OER creation, organisation, dissemination and use that ideally, emanates from the African HEIs themselves, and which analytically describe and evaluates good practice for OER in Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the study suggests that the identification and inclusion of the key stakeholders who would participate in the development of an African OER Network focused on Higher Education and Training might be an effective starting point.",1783040240,,Dissertations & Theses," Bateman, Peter ThomasBatemanThomasPeterBateman, Peter Thomas", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4005064031 , 103450392 , 101309 , U580587 , U580587", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1783040240?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0515 Education, Education," (UMI)AAIU580587 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+critical+analysis+of+the+open+educational+resources+%28oer%29+movement+in+the+higher+education+sector+in+sub-saharan+africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bateman%2C+Peter+Thomas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.194304607,0.953336325,3624,Left,education,bilingual education in Cuzco,"â€œTo be Quechua is to belongâ€: Citizenship, identity, and intercultural bilingual education in Cuzco, Peru","This dissertation explores the conflict surrounding discussions about indigenous rights, ethnicity, and citizenship in the Southern Peruvian highlands as a way to explore recent changes in the way these concepts are understood and lived in Peru. After almost twenty years of political violence in Peru, a group of activists and intellectuals emerged in the 1990s andâ€”like indigenous leaders throughout Latin Americaâ€”demanded government recognition of Peruvian indigenous peoples and of Peru as a multicultural, multiethnic nation. In neighboring Andean countries indigenous movements have acquired increasing political prominence, while in Peru, there is still no national indigenous organization in the highlands. Peruvian activists, through the development and implementation of intercultural bilingual education programs in the highlands, are attempting to promote indigenous Quechua identity among highland peoples in an effort to establish a national highland indigenous organization in the country. Drawing on more than a year of ethnographic fieldwork in Cuzco, Peru, this study examines the clash between Peruvian activists and their initiatives at education reform, and the indigenous Quechua peoples for whom they claim to work and represent, who are strongly opposed to the implementation of bilingual education in their children's schools. This project also looks at the relationship between the state, through its involvement in education and language policy changes, and international agentsâ€”such as UNESCO and UNICEFâ€”closely linked to the elaboration of alternative education programs aimed at social development among indigenous sectors of the population. Theoretically, this dissertation concentrates on the way ethnicityâ€”particularly indigenous ethnicityâ€”is currently being rethought by activists, state agents, and Quechuas themselves. Moreover, it highlights the mobilization of changing ethnic and cultural identity labels in the region. Ultimately, this work shows that the mobilization of ethnicity in Peru is a first step toward the achievement of indigenous autonomy and the recognition of indigenous Peruvians as full citizens.",304587576,,Dissertations & Theses," Garcia, Maria ElenaGarciaElenaMariaGarcia, Maria Elena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727947761 , 31863581 , 66569 , 9780493160368 , 0493160361 , 3006725 , 3006725", Dissertation/Thesis,2000," 9780493160368 , 0493160361", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304587576?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education"," Cultural anthropology , Bilingual education , Multicultural education"," Social sciences , Education , Citizenship , Cuzco , Identity , Intercultural bilingual education , Peru , Quechua",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CTo+be+Quechua+is+to+belong%E2%80%9D%3A++Citizenship%2C+identity%2C+and+intercultural+bilingual+education+in+Cuzco%2C+Peru&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garcia%2C+Maria+Elena&amp;isbn=9780493160368&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.592856848,0.93502727,1323,Left,education,education reform in France; Basque activism,"Giving voice to language: Basque language activism and the politics of education reform in France, 1969â€“1994","Over the past several decades there has been a wellspring of political debate in Europe regarding the rights of linguistic minorities in education. Perhaps nowhere has this transnational debate sparked more controversy than in France where the notion of linguistic rights has been negatively construed by many political authorities as antithetical to the republican model of universal public education. Despite such enmity a host of ethnolinguistic activists in France have been laboring for decades to transform education from a site of exclusion into a vehicle of empowerment. In this dissertation I explore the mobilization dynamics that characterized a minority language schooling initiative within the French Basque Country from 1969 to 1994. Drawing on qualitative case study data, I pay particular attention to the struggles, strategies and successes of Basque language activists affiliated with a community-based schooling association known as â€˜Seaskaâ€™. Building on social movement theory, I argue that Seaska gradually accrued the support of reluctant policy-makers by mobilizing an influential repertoire of discursive, organizational and performative strategies. Throughout my discussion I show how these strategic practices allowed Seaska to cope with an enduring tide of political opposition, seize upon several windows of political opportunity and gain increasing levels of recognition within the political arena. By way of conclusion I consider future avenues for conducting comparative research on minority language activism in educational settings beyond the French Basque context.",858078929,,Dissertations & Theses," Heidemann, Kai AlainHeidemannAlainKaiHeidemann, Kai Alain", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2298939681 , 54030241 , 66569 , 9781124519319 , 3447312 , 3447312", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,9.78E+12, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858078929?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0458 Education Policy , 0520 Education history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0335 European history , 0458 Education Policy , 0520 Education history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0335 European history , 0458 Education Policy , 0520 Education history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0335 European history , 0458 Education Policy , 0520 Education history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," European history , Education Policy , Education history , Political science , Social structure"," Education , Social sciences , Basque , Education reform , France , Language revitalization , Linguistic rights , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Giving+voice+to+language%3A+Basque+language+activism+and+the+politics+of+education+reform+in+France%2C+1969%E2%80%931994&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heidemann%2C+Kai+Alain&amp;isbn=9781124519319&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.693944408,0.932182236,1392,Left,education,public school movement in urban Moroccan high schools,An ambivalent embrace: The cultural politics of Arabization and the knowledge economy in the Moroccan public school,"Based on eighteen months of fieldwork conducted in urban Moroccan high schools, this dissertation explores the relationship between Arabization â€“ post-Independence nationalizing agenda â€“ and public education. It argues that the contemporary tensions traversing the public school relate to Morocco's ambivalent cultural politics in the postcolonial period and to the social fragmentation this cultural politics has encouraged. During 2007 and 2008, Moroccan public education was widely acknowledged to be in crisis. Both government and international organizations recommended technical correctives to remodel student competences. What they disregarded is that the Arabized public school has been the cultural battleground for the negotiation of Morocco as postcolonial, modernized and developing country. In this light, the knowledge economy of the public school needs to be interrogated as a cultural frame with a socio-political history. Through classroom observations, discussions with students, teachers and parents and curricula analysis, I trace the Arabized school's ambiguous bilingualism between French and Arabic (fushÄ) and narrate how school participants encounter their colonial heritage as this is re-articulated in the discourse of development. Besides being endangered by the continuous promotion of the French language, Arabization suffers from internal contradictions; through its deployment for the preservation of monarchical authority, Arabization maintains the sacredness and immutability of fushÄ at the expense of the language's wider deployment in new spheres of expression. This tension frustrates students' efforts at social integration and leads to profound skepticism towards the state's moral authority. Arabization is further challenged by alternative portrayals of Moroccan-ness voiced by the Amazigh cultural movement, which is increasingly lending its vocabulary to students' self-narratives. Focusing on the practical articulation between school participants and institution, I nuance theories of socio-cultural reproduction, ideological interpellation and postcolonial criticism to account for unpredictability, incompleteness and ambivalence. These dynamics reconfigure the school, from mechanism of social and symbolic engineering to public space where the cultural politics of Morocco is debated. The debate engages discipline orientations, language form and language training, history, science, translation and moral cultivation. It extends to the experience of cultural politics outside the school where cultural identification and creativity get constantly re-signified through the everyday practices of students.",822244882,,Dissertations & Theses," Boutieri, CharisBoutieriCharisBoutieri, Charis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2229242901 , 56866471 , 66569 , 9781124392707 , 3437751 , 3437751", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822244882?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," Cultural anthropology , Educational sociology , North African Studies , Language"," Education , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Arabization , Development , Education , Knowledge economy , Language politics , Morocco , Postcolonialism , Public education , Translation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+ambivalent+embrace%3A+The+cultural+politics+of+Arabization+and+the+knowledge+economy+in+the+Moroccan+public+school&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boutieri%2C+Charis&amp;isbn=9781124392707&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.534062043,0.894188189,2310,Right,education,co-operative educational movement ,For 'getting it': an ethnographic study of co-operative schools,"The marketisation of the educational sector continues to shape educational provision, policy and practice on a worldwide scale (Apple, 2001; Ball, 2008; Giroux, 2004), ostensibly providing â€˜freedomâ€™ through the conflation of consumer â€˜choiceâ€™ and â€˜equality of opportunityâ€™ via the invisible hand of the market. The assumption that competitive markets will produce better schools and outcomes for their students veils the extent to which a large proportion of the worldâ€™s population are positioned as marginal actors, unable to â€˜competeâ€™ or â€˜chooseâ€™ as equals, as they engage on a significantly uneven playing field (Mills &amp; McGregor, 2014; Reay, 2012). Historical and global (cf. Fielding &amp; Moss, 2011; Neill, 1990; Wrigley et al., 2012) examples of democratic alternatives to the traditional institution of â€˜the schoolâ€™ have provided rich evidence of the radical possibilities for social change in the form of case studies and academic critique. However, the absence of a cohesive platform which allows a multiplicity of voices and diverse contexts to collaborate together and develop a more effective voice, risks positioning these more radical models at the fringe of educational reform. This represents a significant challenge for extending democracy within educational contexts. The co-operative movement represents a possible solution to this, especially in terms of developing its capacity to create a powerful alliance of partners which can reorient the means and ends of public education towards social justice. Indeed, in just six years co-operative schools have come to represent the third largest grouping within the English public education system (Munn, 2013) and in January 2014, there were just over 700 schools in the UK which have committed to adopting co-operative values (self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, solidarity, openness and honesty, social responsibility and caring for others) within the very heart of their schoolâ€™s ethos (Shaw, forthcoming, 2015). Although the first English co-operative trust school opened in 2008, sustained analysis of this model has not been undertaken to date. Therefore, this research project attempts to offer the beginnings of a critical conversation that considers the possibilities and challenges that such a model of schooling might have to offer by undertaking a systematic examination of the recent emergence of a â€˜co-operativeâ€™ model of public schooling from within the socio-historical context of decades of neoliberal educational â€˜reformsâ€™. This piece of research maps out how this model is variously conceived as a more ethical brand by some, and as a radical project which creates the necessary conditions for democracy and social justice to flourish by others. This research therefore, seeks to understand how tropes of â€œgetting itâ€ both constitute and confuse readings of freedom and equality in education as nascent understandings of co-operative school membership become slippery subjects of cooperative school discourse. By undertaking a critical discursive analysis of claims that co-operative school governance structures allow everyone to â€˜have a sayâ€™, this thesis develops a theoretical engagement and provocation of â€˜voiceâ€™ in education as it becomes increasingly troubled with and by attempts to answer the question, â€˜what is a co-operative school?â€™ and â€˜what can it do?â€™ In order to answer these questions, data drawn from critical ethnographic fieldwork undertaken at three co-operative trust and academy schools during 2012-13 was considered alongside discourse analysis of an emerging body of â€˜textsâ€™ that sought to inform and promote â€˜co-operationâ€™ in school. As a result of exploring the accounts of Others who offered a range of narratives that reflect the â€˜making upâ€™ (Hacking, 1990) of the co-operative subject, these different versions of events brought into view both the challenges and the possibilities that â€˜cooperativeâ€™ schools and their members face; as the values and principles of cooperation are also shaped (but not necessarily determined) by claims made for equality which reflect the messiness of everyday school life. Furthermore, this piece of research highlighted the extent to which studentsâ€™ experiences of â€œgetting itâ€ (cooperative schooling) troubled corresponding rights to be included in decision-making processes as the conditions of co-operative school membership are intersected by multiple axes of difference and inequality, both within educational discourse and in wider society. This research suggests that despite the promising emergence of a model of schooling that places a collective approach to civil society at its core, historical asymmetries of power and entrenched marketisation of educational provision and practice tended to prevail. This severely limited the extent to which schools were able to create the conditions of possibility for everyone to â€œget itâ€ and â€˜have a sayâ€™. I thus argue that, in order for co-operative schools to resist the neo-liberal appropriation of freedom through the lens of the â€˜rationalâ€™ individual consumer of education, significant restructuring of governance arrangements is required alongside considerable advocacy work that addresses studentsâ€™ rights to be included and protected as full members of the school community. This thesis closes with a number of observations and recommendations that contribute to reinvigorating the debate about what cooperative schooling can do, in addition to highlighting how this research project offers further insight about the conceptual and methodological dilemmas that work to shape the construction of childrenâ€™s agency and subjectivities as students are variously positioned as heterogeneous subjects of co-operative education and educational research.",1857778156,,Dissertations & Theses," Davidge, GailDavidgeGailDavidge, Gail", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Theatre and education practitioners worldwide have come to recognise TIE as an important resource for the reinforcement of institutional or orthodox education.

During this process of transplantation, the representation of TIE has become an issue that demands careful deliberation in the island. This dissertation surveys the development of Theatre-in-Education in Taiwan from a personal perspective, as well as demonstrating the interdisciplinary relationship between TIE and regional/community theatre through a case study on the encounter of the Greenwich and Lewisham Young Peopleâ€™s Theatre (GYPT) and the Tainan Jen Theatre Troupe. By making use of first-hand experience of TIE transplantation (from Britain to Taiwan) and of interviews with TIE practitioners, the author intends to contextualise the Taiwanese TIE movement by relating it to an international trend of audience-oriented theatre. Within this framework, the author argues that the localisation of British TIE in Taiwan is best embodied, and therefore can be expected to find strength in the association of TIE and those Taiwanese theatre groups of or with a community-friendly nature; in addition, the continuing social, cultural and educational reforms will create a better environment for the growth of Theatre-in-Education in the island.",1221968708,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsai, Chi-changTsaiChi-changTsai, Chi-chang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2832400201 , 45027191 , 101309 , U578566 , U578566", Dissertation/Thesis,2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1221968708?accountid=14496, 0273 Art education, 0273 Art education, 0273 Art education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0273 Art education, Art education," 539877 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+transplantation+of+theatre-in-education+from+britain+to+taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsai%2C+Chi-chang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.381042201,0.903430564,3517,Unknown,education,Imam-Hatip school movmenet in Turkey,Religious education in Turkey: A socio-historical study of the Imam-Hatip schools,"The question of whether and how religious functionaries such as imams and hatips should be educated has been an extremely controversial issue in Turkey for most of this century. In the midst of sweeping anti-religious reforms to create a new nation with a new identity under the guidance of rationalism and scientism, religious education was eliminated in 1924. After the introduction of the multi-party system in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, religious education re-emerged as a result of grassroots demands and pressures. Since then, the secular governments have taken a great interest in controlling and directing religious education. Despite governmental discouragement, the Imam-Hatip school system gained momentum in the 1960s and particularly in the late 1970s. These schools have shown remarkable vitality, attracting ever-increasing numbers of students. Contrary to the original legislative intent, the Imam-Hatip schools developed from a vocational system for the training of religious personnel into an alternative school system in which students receive both a religious and secular academic education at the secondary level. This study explores the relationships established between the people and the governments of Turkey under the electoral framework of the multi-party system and demonstrates that the public could and did force the government to answer the demand for Imam-Hatip schools. The Imam-Hatip school system from 1924 to the present is studied in relation to major social, political and educational developments in order to determine how socio-political factors shaped the present system of religious education in Turkey. As the case of the Imam-Hatip schools demonstrates, educational reform in Turkey has been motivated by the people's ideas and beliefs rather than imposed from above by the government. Today, a major ""post-Kemal self-discovery"" is taking place in Turkey. Concerned not only about Islam, this movement is focused on religion's potential for inculcating broad and sophisticated cognitive, emotional and ethical skills for dealing with the chaotic global, social, economic and ideological upheavals that mark the contemporary world.",304267606,,Dissertations & Theses," Tarhan, MehmetTarhanMehmetTarhan, Mehmet", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741878721 , 19497841 , 66569 , 9623807 , 9623807", Dissertation/Thesis,1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304267606?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history"," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history"," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history",," 0520 Education history , 0527 Religious education , 0320 Religious history"," Education history , Religious education , Religious history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Religious+education+in+Turkey%3A+A+socio-historical+study+of+the+Imam-Hatip+schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tarhan%2C+Mehmet&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.902873827,0.898575763,2340,Unknown,education,Confucius teaching educational movement in China,"Risen from chaos: the development of modern education in china, 1905-1948","My PhD thesis studies the rise of modern education in China and its underlying driving forces from the turn of the 20th century. It is motivated by one sweeping educational movement in Chinese history: the traditional Confucius teaching came to an abrupt end, and was replaced by a modern and national education model at the turn of the 20th century. This thesis provides the first systematic quantitative studies that examine the rise of education through the initial stage of its development. It mainly contains three analytical parts. The first one sets out the jourey toward the birth of the first modern education system, and generalized the main virtues and progresses it brought to China. The second section provides long-term estimates on how much education progressed through 20th century based on a rich variety of indicators: literacy rate, enrolment ratio, and more importantly -- human capital stock (average years of schooling). This exercise allows putting Chinese accomplishments in education into international perspective. The last Chapter of this thesis tackles one hotly debated question that â€˜what factors drove the rise of mass schooling (primary education)?â€™ Given its political turmoil and economic backwardness, the expansion of modern primary schooling that was mainly driven by increasing public efforts seems puzzling. What contributed to mass educationâ€™s noteworthy diffusion in China? Based on a dataset that covers more than one thousand counties, we find that economic factors have little power in explaining the variations in educational outcomes. In contrast, both informal practice of governance imposed by gentry (one important social group in Chinese history) and regional political stability presented their critical importance. The findings of this section not only contribute to pin down determinants of education expansion, but also shed lights on a growing literature stressing the importance of informal institution in providing public goods in non-democratic societies.",1780274873,,Dissertations & Theses," Gao, PeiGaoPeiGao, Pei", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018938771 , 103451732 , 101309 , 10091735 , 10091735 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3169/", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780274873?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3169/ , (UMI)AAI10091735 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Risen+from+chaos%3A+the+development+of+modern+education+in+china%2C+1905-1948&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gao%2C+Pei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.162064722,0.984323559,2277,Right,elites,inter-locking and multifaceted control of the elites over forest-related decisions,Elite capture and forest governance in India,"Elite capture is a persistent problem in forest governance. Influential and powerful elites often capture a major portion of forest-based benefits due to their well-entrenched structural domination of forest governance. The problem is chronic and many scholars have held it responsible for the continuous failure of the state efforts to manage forests equitably and sustainably. They have blamed it for inequitable outcomes. The representation of the state as an incapable entity in countering the elite domination has encouraged various actors to promote the alternative institutional arrangements. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is one of such initiatives that call for an active involvement of communities in forest governance through arrangements that do not include only government. CBNRM has been implemented in many countries through decentralization reforms mostly driven by international donors, non-governmental organizations, fiscal compulsions of central governments and the demands of the civil society and social movements. CBNRM is considered as an antidote to the persistent problem of elite capture. By empowering communities to make plans, and implement them, CBNRM aims at tackling the influence and the domination of the elites over the decision-making processes. However, the evidence does not support this contention. Many studies have shown that CBNRM is highly prone to elite capture. Overwhelming evidence from several studies have shown that CBNRM ignores issues of power relations favoring elites. The poor fail to participate effectively in the participatory programs due to structural barriers and, therefore, fail to shape the decisions on forest resources on which their own livelihoods depend. CBNRM has largely failed in breaking the tight inter-locking and multifaceted control of the elites over forest-related decisions. The continuous failure of forest governance to tackle elite capture motivates the question: â€œWhat governance mechanisms reduce the probability of elite capture in forest management to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes?â€ Drawing on the literature from political science, political ecology, policy sciences and natural resource governance literature to conclude, elite capture is reduced when (i) state or external interventions adopt a pro-poor targeted approach, and (ii) autonomous counter power has emerged in the form of individuals or groups that constantly challenge the institutionalized authority of elites. A mixed method approach - both qualitative as well as quantitative - provides a deeper understanding of the processes involved in elite capture generalizes to large set of cases. This dissertation is based on the analysis of (i) comparative case studies of elite capture in three local governments under decentralized forest management (ii) a dataset of 38 local governments over 7 years on the distribution of timber for house construction and repair from public forests, and (iii) state regulation of felling of trees on private lands that includes market transactions between 11,005 farmers and 215 market traders in 573 villages in Northern India. This analysis shows that only where pro-poor state or external interventions create conditions for autonomous counter power to emerge, has the hold of elites over forest governance been reduced. The counter power emerges when certain prerequisite conditions are present. These include the presence of affirmative action from external interventions, the creation of institutionalized space for collective action, and the existence of clear property rights over common-pool resources. The autonomous counter power acts as an external mechanism to ensure accountability of local resource governance. Foresters should, therefore, engage with the existing corridors of powers on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged sections to make existing forest governance equitable and sustainable.",1642406795,,Dissertations & Theses," Rana, PushpendraRanaPushpendraRana, Pushpendra", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3546756511 , 92623052 , 66569 , 9781321366181 , 3646610 , 3646610", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1642406795?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Geography , Natural Resource Management , Political science , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Autonomous counter power , Decentralization , Elite capture , Forest governance , India , Natural resource management , Neaest neighbor matching , Spatial econometrics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Elite+capture+and+forest+governance+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rana%2C+Pushpendra&amp;isbn=9781321366181&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.756474356,0.983794657,3196,Right,elites,Chinese insurance industry,Try To Elaborate The Social Management Function Of The Chinese Insurance,"Along with the development of social economy, the technology progress and people risk the consciousness's exaltation, insurance, be used as a kind of economy system of guarantee, develop the important function at guaranteeing economy, promoting reform, stabilizing society, takeing benefit to people.Develop in the social and economic life realm along with the modern insurance cognition that as to it's the continuously extending of function, objective last request function contain a process for gradually increasing.Function that traditional insurance theories think, the insurance primarily is an economy to compensate with the funds congenial.Along with the fulfillment that development, society that modern insurance industry gave the new function of insurance with the theoriesed, namely society management function.It is the objective cognition that the insurance industry develop the particular history stage inside characteristic, and is the science summary that insurance industry is concerned with social risk management and play important role.Insurance industry conduct and actions management and manage the risk's special profession, and provide the economy compensate is the most basic function, and also is our country insurance industry instauration after the local business of main function performance.Insurance finance that develop on the economic and in expiation of foundation that congenial function of funds, is a concrete to belong to the sex now.Insurance industry the backlog's large quantity funds, develop more and more important function.Along with the society that insurance industry develop a certain degree also deep into arrive the society living many levels, insurance physically have to guarantee management, social risk management, the social relation manage to manage the function with social reputation, and have already started the quilt cognition.The insurance's social management function is the insurance's social management function of a new function, research that develop of insurance, for the right confidence our country the development direction of the insurance industry, insurance industry of can keep on developping to melt into the national economy to develop with society in have the very important meaning, and promote the development of the economy, and guarantee the stability of the society, service for developping middle-class family social completely.

Even now when Spain has gone from being a country characterized by sending emigrants, then a receiving country and back again, it is not easy to find academic analysis on return processes. In the case of the British retired population, return migration after retirement analysis gets complicated by several factors, among which there is the fact that quite often these migrations are considered by the host society as touristic movements and also the generalization of wealth among the community. This thesis presents an analysis of return migration after a retirement migration of British citizens in the region of the Marina Alta (Alacant). Using approaches as the International Retirement Migration, Lifestyle Migration and core migration theories, we consider a triple approach to an invisible phenomenon with very little evidence. Data from Continuous Register Statistics and the Residential Variations Statistics and the Population Information System is used. Secondly, an approach to the return intentions as they are expressed by the group of British residents in the Marina Alta territory has been studied. These opinions were collected through an electronic survey conducted during the months of August to October 2014. Finally we used semifocused interviews with 30 informants that are people in touch with the group of residents and who are offering their point of view both of the British residentsâ€™ return process as well as the difficulties they face. The main results of this study are, in first place, that the British return movement from Marina Alta to the UK has been growing in recent years, with major peaks in 2010 and 2013, and it is expected a growing trend in the next few years. Several reasons explain this trend: on the one hand the gradual aging of the group, mostly arrived between 1999 and 2006. On the other hand, the effects of the crisis, among which there is the expected difficulty to sell the properties acquired hoping that they would assure a wealthy retirement, which in result, would accelerate the sale process, even taking losses against the initial investment. Another factor to consider is the comparison of costs and benefits between the services offered by the Spanish welfare system, cut to a minimum in its practical application under the â€œDependency Lawâ€ in the Valencian Country, and a liberal system, although with a high range coverage in the case of the UK. And last, but not least, there is the administrative depuration of the register, which has undergone in the last few years. Second, it has to be noted that the group of British residents in the Marina Alta mostly express their desire to remain in the region, thus denying his desire to return. 29% of the surveyed sample expressed their desire to return to a higher amount than others return intention measures observed in similar territories. In addition, a significant portion of the population moves between return and remain intentions, which leads us to consider the weak migration planning with the consequences this may have for an aging and sometimes vulnerable population. Finally, the discourse analysis of semifocused interviews provides an overview on the return process, in some way opposed to the canons of research on retirement migration. On the one hand, because of the difficulties faced when the group has to perform an assisted return under unfavourable conditions in terms of health or finances. On the other hand, because of the helping ways that the expats found regardless of autonomous return or family helped return, basically managed by local or British charities, or by a combination of both. Given the results, this research suggests the need to take measures to normalize the residence of British population in the Marina Alta and, by extension, in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the rest of Spain. These measures have to go through the need to legalize the residence in Spain, with tight controls in the registers and, in particular, an increase in the effort to ensure the proper administrative and statistical monitoring of migrations and a greater involvement of the UK authorities. Moreover, we should introduce measures to promote the exchange of information between authorities, not only on economic and tax matters, but also to reduce the fraud and misuse of health and social services, and to have real information of migratory processes, and ultimately facilitate a return process that sometimes can become calamitous. Finally, there should be a greater involvement of the British government, not only in control and information, but also in ensuring health and social welfare among their residents.

In seeking to understand how the strategic use of frames by different categories of U.S. elites (e.g., government officials, corporate officials, etc.) effectively limited or expanded options for state action in response to the attacks of 9â€“11, this dissertation utilizes and builds on the framing perspective of the social movements' literature. This study considers how elite opinion shapers mobilize collective action frames for elite ends, which draw upon a collective identity and shared racialized, gendered and classed ideologies of â€˜Americaâ€™, its enemies, and its role in the world. Qualitative Content Analysis and Critical Framing Analysis were employed upon a theoretically purposive sample of major speeches of George W. Bush (GWB) and New York Times (NYT) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorials, staff commentaries and guest op-eds. Differences and similarities in diagnostic, prognostic and motivational framing between sources and categories of elites were identified and sociologically explained. This analysis included measuring the amount of support each media document gave for the ideological assumptions of the WOT as represented in speeches of GWB. Although the WSJ was more supportive of the WOT than the NYT, the NYT editorial board was farther ahead of its readership in support of the WOT. And media elites from both newspapers were more supportive of the WOT than government officials. Near consensus for all groups of elites was found for the policy of preemptive strikes and specifically regime change in Iraq. The media were found to not only translate and circulate elite ideologies of the WOT but to help amplify the framing of them as well. What emerged from the data while employing Critical Framing Analysis to examine constructions of race; class and economics; and gender in elite discourse, was an ideology that can best be described as an imperialist ideology. It is argued that elites and media elites in particular, delegitimated not only â€˜terroristsâ€™ but those who criticized the â€˜inevitabilityâ€™ of the Americanization of global economy and culture.",305204724,,Dissertations & Theses," Klocke, Brian VirgilKlockeVirgilBrianKlocke, Brian Virgil", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 828402671 , 19298711 , 66569 , 9780496123612 , 0496123610 , 3151935 , 3151935", Dissertation/Thesis,2004," 9780496123612 , 0496123610", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305204724?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Social structure , Political science , Mass media , International law , International relations"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Discourse , Elite ideologies , Framing , Media , Terrorism , War on terrorism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Framing+the+world%3A+Elite+ideologies+in+United+States+media+discourse+of+the+War+on+Terrorism+campaign&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klocke%2C+Brian+Virgil&amp;isbn=9780496123612&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.418849674,0.933538233,2002,Right,elites,new public management movement,Study on performance-excellence-based local government overall performance evaluation model in china,"Translation from original language as provided by author With the global economic and social development, human's need to handling public affairs diversifies. As the main function of government serving the society, public administration becomes the focus all over the world.

Building on both historical and ethnographic data, it details a multiplicity of ways in which Malian women influence political events. It does so by highlighting the often opaque political implications of women's ritual and economic activities. Women's formal organizations may constitute often covert but powerful electoral lobbies. They work as mediators between state institutions and citizens and may be asked by local power holders to enforce administrative changes at the local level. Moreover, women's groups represent a major reference point for local and international aid agencies in search of development partners. This work begins with a critical review of some of the available literature on village politics. It tries to account for the ways that memories of the past have informed people's political practices during the struggle for independence from France. The work continues with discussing a number of institutional transformations that women's formal organizations have gone through from the colonial era to the present. While it describes the diverse historical phases of the women's movement, the main goal remains to further an understanding of the relationship between political practices and local culture. At the center of my discussion I situate the patronage system, since relationships among women within their organizations are far from egalitarian. Building on work by Amselle, Bagayogo and Lambert de Frondeville, I present patron-client relationships as an orienting paradigm within women's political associations. This discussion allows me to focus on the ways in which women's political activism, social distinctions, and Mande social philosophy intertwine in the practices and representations of female group members. I explore the multiple dimensions of the patronage system in Mali by looking at leaders' professional identities, motivations, cultural values, and political practices.

With rapid development of China's economic, many domestic industries have been stimulated and have developed at an unprecedented speed. With global economic integration and growth, more domestic enterprises are encouraged to participate in international market competition. Facing with domestic and international market competition, consumers' demands for high quality products, environmental deterioration and insufficient natural resources, industry competition and enterprise credit crisis, employees' protection for their legal rights and the requirements of corporate social responsibility for social stability and harmony, domestic corporations must seek new strategies to improve their competitive qualities. The movements of corporate social responsibility are flourishing in the global world, which are considered as guides for corporation social responsibility development and can provide a favorable external environment, more importantly, if we can clarify the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, it will enhance the corporate social responsibility action. This thesis, which is based on corporate social responsibility and stakeholders' theory, will give corporate social responsibility and stakeholder's definition and construct the corporate social responsibility and financial performance research model. After having a deep study of academic literatures, the author has constructed social responsibility and financial performance measures and selected research methods which meet the requirements of models to carry out correlation and regression study. By using 51 pharmaceutical companies listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen Securities Exchange from 2003 to 2009, I have done empirical research on the relationship between pharmaceutical corporate social responsibility and corporate financial performance.

Moreover, the work here assesses the overall impact of this type of policy making is as it emerges from privately-formed, yet publicly-directed CSR networks seeking to regulate global business behavior. The growing popularity of this type of engagement between business and civil society opens it up to criticism that it falls short in terms of its overall democratic responsiveness. From this, the charge emerges that there exists a fundamental â€œdemocratic deficitâ€ in these more private decision making processes at the heart of CSR engagement as the gulf between the decision makers the decision takers expands. This charge, if true, potentially imperils it as a legitimate means of regulating business-society relations and shaping important public policies.

Scientists and the policy elite alone are unlikely to solve the â€˜wicked problemâ€™ of climate change, even in the unlikely scenario that consensus was reached and concerted international action was forthcoming. Increasingly, it is recognised that institutional learning through technocratic refinements of the status quo are inadequate. Although there is widespread belief that anthropogenic global warming is an urgent problem, political action has not followed scientific knowledge, because we have been slow to recognise the problemâ€™s cultural implications. A range of voices within the environmental movement (broadly conceived) have increasingly challenged technocratic policy framing, with new ways of thinking. By widening the debate these critical voices increase the possibility of learning to react in new ways, which increase the capacity for collective agency. Based on this assessment, the aim of this thesis is to explore the ways in which the cultural politics of particular activist milieus generate public curriculum, through catalyzing the relationship between the cultural politics of civil society and the political culture of the state. From the 1960s onwards, the environmental movement has undergone a process of differentiation and specialisation, such that distinct cultural formations â€“ oriented around direct action, relocalisation, and professional campaigning â€“ emerged. Different ideal typical modes of â€œclimate change communicationâ€ â€“ agonistic pluralism, public participation, and social marketing (Carvalho &amp; Peterson, 2012) â€“ can be mapped onto the public pedagogies of these activist cultures. Political theorist Chantal Mouffe (2005, p. 20) uses the term agonistic pluralism to describe a situation where the â€œadversaryâ€ is understood in a productive sense to be â€œa crucial category for democratic politicsâ€: where this is denied, we/they relations are understood to be â€œantagonisticâ€ in the sense that conflicting parties do not recognise the legitimacy of one another. This view recognises the power play and affective commitments that determine modes of political association. On the other hand, â€œpublic participationâ€ views politics as constituted through non-partisan rational deliberation in legitimate public fora. Finally, â€œsocial marketingâ€ approaches discard the notion of people as rational decision makers, but also discard the principle of public participation in favour of the notion that political communication can be improved through expert evidence-based interventions. Cultures of direct climate action tend towards agonistic communicative styles, characterised by contestatory moments and a public pedagogy of â€œdefining the enemyâ€ (Newman, 1994). On the other hand, this approach has been perceived as problematic by movement intellectuals in relocalisation movements, who have argued that the non-politicised experimental practices of local communities, which engage optimistically with a sense of the possible, may in the long run, be more productive of the kind of mass cultural value shift required in order to tackle climate change. More recently, reflecting their own situated organisational structures and actor-networks, knowledge workers in the professional campaigning sector have increasingly applied insights from social psychology, behavioural economics, and cognitive science in order to find ways that engage tacit cultural values and norms in their public pedagogical efforts. In seeking to ascertain the ideal conditions for communication, the ENGO sector aligns most closely with a â€˜social marketing approachâ€™ to public pedagogy. Working with the â€˜agonisticâ€™ discourse theory of Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau, I believe that all cultures of activism necessarily engage in a contingent politics of articulation, at the heart of which lies antagonism and hegemonic struggle. In this thesis, I construct an intertextual research model, capable of exploring the contingent processes of articulation within cultures of climate change activism, between them, and between the movement at large, and the wider public, as they engage (implicitly or explicitly) in hegemonic struggles that provide moments of educative potential to activists, bystanders and politicians. I argue that the public pedagogies of these cultures of activism cohere around the articulation of what Laclau (2005) would call â€œempty signifiersâ€, which link particular claims, interests, and identities through creating a frontier separating them from an outside, which partially constitutes the insideâ€™s identity.",1775429129,,Dissertations & Theses," McGregor, Callum KennethMcGregorKennethCallumMcGregor, Callum Kenneth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3974074541 , 102698722 , 101309 , 10033572 , 10033572 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9832", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775429129?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9832 , (UMI)AAI10033572 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultural+politics+of+climate+change+activism+in+the+uk+as+public+pedagogy+%282005-2011%29%3A+direct+action%2C+relocalisation%2C+and+professional+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McGregor%2C+Callum+Kenneth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.313518257,0.926158538,3374,Left,environmental,sustainable development,Sustainable development and tourism,"The intent of this study is to investigate the role and responsibility of tourism from the perspective of sustainable development. The goals and processes of development are reviewed as they evolved after the end of World War II along the path to sustainable development. Development goals expanded from a narrow economic focus to include social and human development. Development processes encompassed building human capabilities and democratic institutions to facilitate greater participation of the stakeholders affected by development effort. This trend opened up investigation to what extent development was sustainable in the long run. Tourism, as a major development option, has been promoted for its potential to offer a unique combination of features that provide opportunities to meet established sustainable development dimensions. To examine this hypothesis, a theoretical and methodological framework is constructed with five key dimensions arranged to recognize that, for development to be sustainable, it must embrace social and human as well as economic development goals achieved through processes and institutions operating within the context of protecting existing human cultures and natural environments. Indicators from this framework that address the evaluation of sustainability of development in general are enhanced with additional indicators from numerous international, regional, national, and local sources for evaluating sustainable development of tourism in particular. This expanded framework is used to examine and analyze development of international tourism across twenty-eight destinations to see if there were occasions where indicators from all five key dimensions of sustainable development were successfully applied. In order to explore linkages between tourism development and sustainable development, extensive data were collected from sixty sample case-studies. No occasions were found where all the dimensions of sustainable development have been successfully addressed as measured by positive indicators taken from the sample case-studies. This indicates that tourism may not be compatible with sustainable development. Future research should investigate whether sample-case studies describing more recent tourism development show a trend of improvement in the movement towards sustainability.",305427704,,Dissertations & Theses," Speier, Jonathan VanSpeierVanJonathanSpeier, Jonathan Van", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1158512461 , 18219261 , 66569 , 9780542713842 , 3220162 , 3220162", Dissertation/Thesis,2005,9.78E+12, English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305427704?accountid=14496," 0617 Public administration , 0814 Recreation , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0617 Public administration , 0814 Recreation , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0617 Public administration , 0814 Recreation , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0617 Public administration , 0814 Recreation , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," Public administration , Recreation , Urban planning , Area planning & development"," Social sciences , Sustainable development , Tourism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustainable+development+and+tourism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Speier%2C+Jonathan+Van&amp;isbn=9780542713842&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.926014276,0.912922472,675,Left,environmental,Occupy; anti-GMO movement,Making the case against GMOs: Issue adoption and adaptation by occupy activists,"The Occupy movement is one of several global justice social movements that have appeared around the world in recent years. Other prominent movements include the Arab Spring, the 15-M protest movement in Spain, and anti-austerity protests in Italy, Greece, and other parts of Europe. Although Occupy has many of the traditional components of social movements, it differs in that it is generally unwilling to focus on a single issue or to make specific demands. In addition, the many Occupy groups that have appeared worldwide do not represent a single culture and mission but rather are subject to local variation based on community-specific history, culture, and identity. Occupy groups identify a wide range of social, economic, and environmental issues of both local and global concern and make decisions about which issues to address and what actions to take at any specific point in time. This ethnographic case study examines the role of social representations (group values, beliefs, and descriptions) and political opportunity structure (historic, cultural, and political environment) in determining the focus of protest. Activism by Occupiers in Ventura County, California in opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) was studied to determine what factors contributed to the selection of this issue for protest over other recognized issues. The study finds that a combination of external stimuli, internal champions, evolving representations, and access to a protest target were significant in the choice of protest subjects. Internal dialogue within the group produced a concern over GMOs in the food supply that made activism in support of the global anti-GMO movement a perceived worthwhile activity for the group. The campaign to label GMOs in California made the issues related to GMOs publicly visible, and the physical presence of a Monsanto facility (a major manufacturer of GM seeds) provided a location for protest.",1513234949,,Dissertations & Theses," Long, Tracy NoraLongNoraTracyLong, Tracy Nora", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3267934051 , 86686032 , 66569 , 9781303786990 , 3614029 , 3614029", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1513234949?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0344 Social research"," Cultural anthropology , Social research"," Social sciences , Ethnographic case study , Genetically modified organisms , Gmos , Occupy movement , Political opportunity structure , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+the+case+against+GMOs%3A+Issue+adoption+and+adaptation+by+occupy+activists&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Long%2C+Tracy+Nora&amp;isbn=9781303786990&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.903171894,0.912489832,3140,Left,environmental,Peruvian environmental movement,"The lords of guano: Science and the management of Peru's marine environment, 1800â€“1973","This is an ecological history of a development project planned and managed by technical experts: the origin, decline, spectacular revival, and tragic fate of the Peruvian guano industry. In another sense, this is a social history of an elite typeâ€”the environmental technocratâ€”and those they served. During the nineteenth century, scientific travelers appropriated Andean knowledge of vast, ancient deposits of nitrogen fertilizer for use by farmers in the Northern Hemisphere. During the early twentieth century, environmental scientists reoriented the guano industry for Peruvian use. They oversaw the development of perhaps â€œthe greatest of all industries based upon the conservation of wild animals.â€ This project had both global and local repercussions. The two-way exchange of personnel, ideas, and technologies between Peru and the rest of the world revolutionized scientific understanding of the Peru Current ecosystem. This knowledge led directly to international recognition of the global importance of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon. Through the issue of human population control, Peru's experiment inspired the emergence of an environmental movement that spanned the Americas after World War II. In Peru, technical experts fundamentally influenced the political process, input-intensive agriculture, artisanal and industrial fishing, the organization of â€œbig scienceâ€ institutions, as well as the guano birds and their ecological community. Ultimately, technocrats enriched and empowered a new ruling class for Peru. Beginning in the 1940s, the specter of an impending catastrophe in the global food supply gave impetus to the exploitation of the world's fish stocks. To serve this demand, scientists helped engineer for Peru the largest industrial fishery on Earth. Their studies legitimated the decision to let the guano birds pass into oblivion so their food, the anchoveta , could be processed into animal feed. As a reflection of persistent global trends of food distribution, rather than feed the world's undernourished, this fishmeal enabled affluent northerners to consume more meat. This fishery was carefully supervised by experts, but they proved unable to prevent its collapse during the El NiÃ±o of 1972â€“1973. This ecological disaster reveals how fleeting â€œsustainable growthâ€ can be, even for the best-managed development projects.",305294857,,Dissertations & Theses," Cushman, Gregory ToddCushmanToddGregoryCushman, Gregory Todd", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765265821 , 30406431 , 66569 , 3119663 , 3119663", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305294857?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0585 Science history , 0768 Environmental science"," 0336 Latin American history , 0585 Science history , 0768 Environmental science"," 0336 Latin American history , 0585 Science history , 0768 Environmental science",," 0336 Latin American history , 0585 Science history , 0768 Environmental science"," Latin American history , Science history , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , El Nino , Environmental history , Guano , Marine environment , Peru",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+lords+of+guano%3A+Science+and+the+management+of+Peru%27s+marine+environment%2C+1800%E2%80%931973&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cushman%2C+Gregory+Todd&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.416770059,0.912023626,982,Left,environmental,Fair trade coffee in Costa Rica,Fair trade coffee in Costa Rica: A new model for sustainable development?,"Costa Rica offers an excellent case study due to its historically distinctive democracy, nationalist tradition, and unique economic development, all aspects historically intertwined with coffee production in this country. This study examines the current situation of coffee producers and the coffee industry, both of which operate under the guidelines of the global commodity chain (GCC), a global trading mechanism that creates power and income disparities among the different actors involved. Fair trade has emerged as an alternative to the GCC with the potential to offer social, economic, and environmental benefits to coffee producers and their communities. This dissertation questions whether fair trade can offer an alternative model of development for coffee producers in Costa Rica in the era of globalization. Cooperatives can be sites of progressive and social empowerment and the fair trade movement, sharing many of these goals, alternatively markets their products. Drawing upon primary and secondary data, including field research and interviews, this research project examines the nine cooperative members of the consortium COOCAFE from two different angles: first, as cooperatives that offer benefits for its members; second, as fair trade cooperatives that offer fair trade advantages not available to any other coffee cooperative in Costa Rica outside the consortium. A wide spectrum of cooperative and fair trade cooperative attributes and services are examined. The study, moving beyond this initial set of criteria, further examines two issues: environmental sustainability and gender. Ecological issues that derive from coffee production, such as deforestation, water and soil pollution, and loss of biodiversity are examined to determine if the cooperatives do indeed maintain sustainability while producing coffee, following fair trade criteria. Also, this dissertation addresses the absence of women in the literature of agriculture and development, and examines the role/s that women involved in the cooperatives have in the production of fair trade coffee and the extent to which fair trade benefits women in particular. The study concludes that fair trade, as an alternative trading mechanism, has the potential to counterbalance the detrimental outcomes produced by neoliberal free market policies by deconstructing the notion of development and re-designing global trade systems, making small producers more relevant in the global commodity market.",304766440,,Dissertations & Theses," Pongratz-Chander, KrisztinaPongratz-ChanderKrisztinaPongratz-Chander, Krisztina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1320970821 , 36649991 , 66569 , 3257741 , 3257741", Dissertation/Thesis,2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304766440?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations , Fair trade , Models , Sustainable development , Costa Rica"," Social sciences , Alternative development , Coffee , Costa Rica , Fair trade , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fair+trade+coffee+in+Costa+Rica%3A++A+new+model+for+sustainable+development%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pongratz-Chander%2C+Krisztina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.456509662,0.910615449,3365,Left,environmental,"social justice coffee, south and north","Fair trade in an unfair world?

It is demonstrated that the current vision of the network, based on gaining voluntarist commitments from giant, profit-driven TNCs, is substantially different from the old vision of the network, which sought to play a role in laying the groundwork for a broader movement that aspired to create an alternative trading system based on international market regulation. Contrary to many perceptions, the current market-friendly orientation of the network is highly compatible with neoliberal globalization, which in part explains its sales success and the growing support it has received from TNCs and neoliberal institutions like the World Bank. The remaining chapters focus the analysis on fair trade coffee. Chapters Three and Four provide a short history of the coffee industry and the various strategies to promote development, from the International Coffee Agreement to the Costa Rican social welfare state, and compares them to fair trade. Chapter Five provides a case study of the Union of Indigenous Communities of the Isthmus Region (UCIRI), a Mexican fair trade cooperative, and assesses its success in promoting capability enhancement. Chapter Six examines fair trade in Canada and critically analyzes the network's growing corporate orientation. It is concluded that the network has the ability to provide important developmental benefits to its members, but the long term impact of these gains and the ability to broaden them are significantly limited by the imperatives of global capitalism. While providing an important social justice critique of a neoliberal ""moral economy,"" the network ultimately lacks the broader and more universal reach of the statist development projects pursued in the past.",305390490,,Dissertations & Theses," Fridell, GavinFridellGavinFridell, Gavin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1079667701 , 32783301 , 66569 , 9780494115725 , 0494115726 , NR11572 , NR11572", Dissertation/Thesis,2005," 9780494115725 , 0494115726", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305390490?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Coffee , Fair trade , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fair+trade+in+an+unfair+world%3F+The+prospects+and+limitations+of+social+justice+coffee%2C+south+and+north&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fridell%2C+Gavin&amp;isbn=9780494115725&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.52125527,0.905308638,1715,Left,environmental,young environmentalists,Voices of young environmentalists: A generational perspective on environmentalism,"Modern environmentalism, a conceptual lens through which to view the human relationship with the natural world, has deep roots in the period of social movement building that swept Western nations during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the past half century it has evolved to include new perspectives and face new environmental challenges. More recently, it has been less effective in tackling significant global environmental problems. Fifty years on, a younger generation of environmentalists is now addressing contemporary environmental issues, and developing its own interpretation of how environmentalism can be a force for social change. Through a phenomenological study of 20 young adults from British Columbia who care about the environment, the research focuses on how the group views modern environmentalism. The findings indicate that the participants believe environmentalism is in transition, and they are optimistic about their role in the changes that are under way. The emerging interpretation retains strong continuity with the past, but notably emphasizes people, a deeply personal view of how one lives a sustainable life, a new localism, a focus on community organizing grounded in social media, and a hopeful narrative predicated on solutions.

This finds its expression in Michels' iron law of oligarchy. The contemporary idea of the global information society appears open to new democratic alternatives for organization which escape this double bind. This thesis explores whether these possibilities have any basis in the reality of contemporary organizing. To this end I investigate the global environmental movement, representative of contemporary conditions as the Social Democratic party was of modernity. Contemporary organizing is marked both by a relationship to globality and the importance of the use of information technologies. Friends of the Earth (FoE) was founded by transnational elites, yet is marked in the present by the empowerment of local groups. Thus the identity of FoE is not given over to the action and interests of elites, transnational or national, but rather is a product of the performance of ordinary members. Authority and power relations operate but not on the basis of the command of the centre over the rest but rather in relation to a fundamental negotiation about the requirements of organizing on behalf of he planet. This decenteredness requires us to theorize differently the way we make sense of the boundaries and boundedness of organizing. Globality becomes our focus rather than modern internationalism. Information technologies allow organizing to escape the double bind, since they demonstrate that it is not technically inevitable, whilst globality provides the dynamic emphasis that underlines the necessity to escape the problematic of centralization.",301517909,,Dissertations & Theses," Washbourne, Neil J.WashbourneJ.NeilWashbourne, Neil J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757968601 , 44736841 , 101309 , U111552 , U111552", Dissertation/Thesis,1998,, English, English,,1998,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301517909?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU111552 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+iron+laws%3A+information+technology+and+social+transformation+in+the+global+environmental+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Washbourne%2C+Neil+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.523737015,0.999449825,3600,Left,environmental,anti-petro chemical disputes in Louisiana,"Uneasy alchemy: Dissonance, resistance, justice, and change in Louisiana's industrial corridor","The contested discourses of environmental disputes in the rural petro-chemical region of Louisiana are analyzed for the constructed narratives of three disciplinary arenas at the forefront of the debate: health, economics, and the law. Carried out by heterogeneous groups formed specifically around issue-based politics, the public debates are purposeful: they emerge from new social movements actively advocating justice and change with respect to their causes. In the three arenas as well as in the formation of the narrative story, expert-activists played an important role. They brought global knowledge into a conversation with local knowledge to form an important discourse with which to resist and change the corporate-government narrative that was firmly entrenched in the industrial region. The most successful activist strategies typically involved alliances: (1)Â between local citizens and expert-activists, (2)Â across races and classes, and (3)Â between local and national organizations. The residents' affiliation with experts led to a strengthening of local allegations regarding their environment and the emergence of a more participatory, democratic, and effective citizen-input process. By grounding expertise in the lives of everyday people who deal with pollution, I believe, following Sandra Harding, that we reach a closer version of realityâ€”what she terms â€œstrong objectivity.â€ Strong objectivity extends traditional concepts of scientific objectivity by taking into account the underlying agendas and cultures that shaped the science. I use strong objectivity as a lens to examine these citizen-expert alliances and as a test to show why official science, that of corporations and government agencies, is weak at its very foundation. This combination of local knowledge and scientific expertise proved to be a potent hybrid knowledge that has been a catalyst for environmental improvement in the region. Chapters two through five illuminate key tensions in the diverse narratives and interpretations of the issues. Ethnography is my primary methodology. I conducted extensive interviews with local informants, attended numerous public meetings, and referenced public hearing transcripts.

An analysis of the United States NGO policy advocacy for international environmental treaties,"This study aims at analyzing the major determinant factor of success and failure in the efforts of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to influence international environmental policy outcomes. Given the growing role and impact of NGOs in world affairs, it is interesting and important to specify the conditions under which the NGOs make differences in world politics. Among many different areas and levels of NGO involvement in world politics, this study focuses on examining policy advocacy of the U.S. environmental NGOs to shape their government's policy regarding two international environmental treatiesâ€”the Montreal Protocol (1987) for ozone layer protection and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992). Drawn largely from three bodies of literature, this study probes three factors conditioning the efficacy of NGO policy advocacy. The first factor, suggested by the pluralist interest group theory and the resource mobilization theory of social movements, concerns the human and organizational resources of the NGOs. Four elements of NGO resourcesâ€”memberships, revenues, leaderships, and expertiseâ€”are analyzed. The second and third factors are pertinent to what the political process approach to social movements calls the political opportunity structure. The second factor is an availability of NGO access to policy-making processes, while the third factor is a configuration of allies and opponents within the policy networks concerned with each issue. For the access factor, this study examines degrees of NGO access to both the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. federal government in each case. For the alliance and opposition configuration, this study measures and compares the degrees of support/opposition displayed by major participants in policy deliberations of each issue toward NGO advocacy. The analysis shows that while the resource and access factors have not much affected the efficacy of NGO advocacy reflected in the two environmental treaties, the configuration of allies and opponents played a crucial role. Based on these findings, this study makes some theoretical suggestions for future studies of NGO policy advocacy and also practical suggestions for more effective NGO advocacy.",304722056,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Young HoKimHoYoungKim, Young Ho", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728433851 , 26760241 , 66569 , 9780493080888 , 0493080880 , 9999406 , 9999406", Dissertation/Thesis,2001," 9780493080888 , 0493080880", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304722056?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," International law , International relations , Environmental policy , Nongovernmental organizations--NGOs , Studies , Political activism"," Social sciences , Global climate change , International environmental treaties , Nongovernmental organizations , Policy advocacy , World politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+do+NGOs+make+differences+in+world+politics%3F++An+analysis+of+the+United+States+NGO+policy+advocacy+for+international+environmental+treaties&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Young+Ho&amp;isbn=9780493080888&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.077994683,0.994311746,658,Left,environmental,anti-nuclear energy in France and Germany,"'better active today than radioactive tomorrow!': transnational opposition to nuclear energy in france and west germany, 1968-1981","This thesis examines the opposition to civil nuclear energy in France and West Germany during the 1970s, arguing that small-scale interactions among its diverse participants led to broad changes in their personal lives and political environments. Drawing extensively on oral history interviews with former activists as well as police reports, media coverage and protest ephemera, this thesis shows how individuals at the grassroots built up a movement that transcended national (and social) borders. They were able to do so in part because nuclear power was such a multivalent symbol at the time. Residents of towns near planned power stations felt that nuclear technology represented an intervention in their community by state and industry, a potential threat to their health, wealth and way of life. In the decade after 1968, concerns like these coalesced with criticisms of capitalism, the state, militarism and consumer society that were being made by a more politicised constituency. This made the anti-nuclear movement both broad-based and highly fragmented. Activist networks linked people across existing national, political and social boundaries, but the social world of activism was subject to its own divisions (such as between locals and outsiders or between militant and non-violent activists). By analysing both the transnational dimensions and internal divisions of the anti-nuclear movement, this thesis revises the homogenising concepts of social movements that are prevalent in much of the existing sociological and political science literature. At the same time, it situates the anti-nuclear movement historically within the decade of upheaval that was the 1970s, while moving individual activists from the margins to the centre of protest history.",1512398686,,Dissertations & Theses," Tompkins, Andrew S.TompkinsS.AndrewTompkins, Andrew S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264697401 , 86584282 , 101309 , U605291 , U605291 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4af6ec03-08ba-4c3f-a8c9-fffc4f26aa34", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512398686?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4af6ec03-08ba-4c3f-a8c9-fffc4f26aa34 , (UMI)AAIU605291 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27better+active+today+than+radioactive+tomorrow%21%27%3A+transnational+opposition+to+nuclear+energy+in+france+and+west+germany%2C+1968-1981&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tompkins%2C+Andrew+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.056623527,0.993188169,261,Left,environmental,anti-dam activism,Dams and transnational advocacy: Political opportunities in transnational collective action,"Possible arguments to explain the gradual decline in big dam development and its site transferring from developed to developing countries include technical, economic, and political factors. This study focuses on the political argumentâ€”the rise of transnational anti-dam advocacy and its impact on state policy-making. Under what conditions does transnational anti-dam advocacy matter? Under what conditions does transnational advocacy change state dam policies (delay, scale down, or cancel)? It examines the role of transnational anti-dam actors in big dam building in a comparative context in Asia. Applying the social movement theory of political opportunity structure (POS) and using the qualitative case-study method, the study provides both within-case and cross-case analyses. Within-case analysis is utilized to explain the changing dynamics of big dam building in China (Three Gorges Dam and proposed Nu/Salween River dam projects), and to a lesser extent, Sardar Sarovar Project in India and Nam Theun 2 Dam in Laos. Different domestic and international POS (DPOS and IPOS) impact the strategies and outcomes of anti-dam advocacies in these countries. The degree of openness of the POS directly affects the capacity of transnational efforts in influencing state dam policies. The degree of openness or closure is measured by specific laws, institutions, discourse, or elite allies (or the absence of these) for the participation of non-state actors on big dam issues at a particular moment. This degree of openness is relative, varying over time, across countries and regions. This study finds that the impact of transnational anti-dam activism is most effective when both DPOS and IPOS are relatively open. Transnational anti-dam advocacy is least effective in influencing state dam policies when both DPOS and IPOS are relatively closed. Under a relatively open DPOS and closed IPOS, transnational anti-dam advocacy is more likely to successfully change state dam policies and even facilitate the opening of relatively closed IPOS. In contrast, under a relatively closed DPOS and open IPOS, transnational anti-dam advocacy can hardly exist. Without the domestic anti-dam pressure from below, international anti-dam efforts from above are less likely to affect state dam policies or open up closed DPOS.",304862911,,Dissertations & Theses," Fu, TengFuTengFu, Teng", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1688983011 , 42769091 , 66569 , 9781109045475 , 3348453 , 3348453", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304862911?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," Political science , International law , Sociology"," Social sciences , China , Collective action , Dam , Hydropower , Hydropower development , Political opportunity structure , Transnational network",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dams+and+transnational+advocacy%3A+Political+opportunities+in+transnational+collective+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fu%2C+Teng&amp;isbn=9781109045475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.076654294,0.991081014,1236,Left,environmental,Kyoto protocol,Geographies of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;lonialism and hope in the Northwest Pacific Frontier Territory-region of Ecuador,"This dissertation investigates the human dimensions of environmental transformations spurred by international climate change mitigation agreementsâ€”such as the Kyoto Protocolâ€”that encourage lowering greenhouse gas emissions with â€˜greenâ€™ market strategies like biofuel and ecological services development projects. It is methodologically grounded in â€œcollaborative activist geographical methodsâ€ and theoretically based at the nexus of development, political ecologies, neoliberalization of Nature, and geographies of hope literatures. It examines the contradictory and complex ways that state â€œclimate change mitigation developmentâ€ projects surround and infiltrate the Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian ancestral territories of the canton of San Lorenzo (Esmeraldas Province), located in the â€œNorthwest Pacific Fronter Territory-region of Ecuadorâ€. This research asks to what degree the Ecuadorian stateâ€™s support and investment in oil palm plantation expansionâ€”designed to meet biofuel crop demandsâ€”in the coastal rainforest regions results in the rearrangement, and often times, devastation of Indigenous AwÃ¡ and Chachi and Afro-ecuadorian communitiesâ€™ natural and human geographies. It also inquires into the Ecuadorian governmentâ€™s recently approved (October 2008) state-level conservation incentives project called Socio-Bosque (Forest Partners) developed to do the following: protect the rainforests and its ecological services, alleviate poverty in rural areas, and position the country as an â€˜environmental world leaderâ€™ for taking concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from avoided deforestation. Socio Bosque claims to be progressive and even revolutionary, but may enact new forms of exploitation and governance in Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian territories that are specific to time and place, but are enduringly colonial. Nevertheless, this research also highlights geographies of hope by demonstrating that, contrary to the surrounding sea of monoculture oil palm plantations and the CO 2 lonial air of contradictory laws in relation to biofuel and ecological services development, AwÃ¡, Chachi, and Afro-ecuadorian communities maintain sustainable practices and enhance agricultural diversity within their territories. Additionally, it emphasizes the emergent place-based social movements in relation to defense of their territories and identities; Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian communities avoid conflict pressures by creating inter-ethnic networks. By casting social nets between their territories, their communities stay connected and, together, defend their rights to territorial self-determination and â€œLiving Wellâ€ and the rights of Nature.

However, confusion abounds of what constitutes local food systems, and little evidence exists of the capacity of local food systems to significantly support the dietary requirements of major metropolitan areas. Drawing on the fields of sustainability, ecological economics, spatial analysis, regional studies, urban agriculture and social justice, this dissertation is an attempt to address questions of capacity and structure of the local food system in Philadelphia. For this, a conceptual framework for the analysis of local food systems as a strategy for sustainability is developed. The conceptual framework builds on the ecological economics theory argument that there is a fundamental need to acknowledge the natural resource limit for human development and achieve a steady state, or equilibrium in resource consumption and re-generation. Concepts of localization and regionalization in geography, planning, regional and sustainability studies suggest that achieving this type of equilibrium is unlikely at the global scale. Therefore, a more refined study of place and context is required if we are to pursue strategies for sustainability in general and in the case of food systems. In this dissertation the city of Philadelphia is studied to further the knowledge base on local food systems and their potential to promote sustainability in major urban areas. First, socio-spatial analysis is used to study formal and informal components of the local food system and the relationships among them. These include food producing community gardens, institutional gardens, urban farms, educational farms, farmer markets and the farms who supply them, Community Supported Agriculture, local food processing and distribution companies, food retailers and buying clubs that serve the city of Philadelphia. Institutions include city and state government organizations addressing food policy, non-profit organizations and associations dealing with hunger, nutrition, food security, health, education and more. Data is gathered using field research, interviews, and internet resources, analyzed and mapped using ArcGIS. Results define, categorize and map the local food system in Philadelphia as conceptualized and viewed by its participants, and indicate that their interactions in ways of cooperation, sharing of knowledge and resources, and the new economic and social models that arise from their actions, not only define and improve the city's food system, but fundamentally contribute to the sustainability of the city. Next, statistical data and spatial analysis methods are used to calculate the potential for food production in the city and region. Within the urban sphere, infrared aerial photography and other spatial and socio-economic data are utilized, combining remote sensing and GIS techniques to establish land availability and potential for growing food within the city boundaries. At the regional level an ecological economics framework is utilized, analyzing statistical data of land use and agriculture production compared to current food consumption practices and federal dietary guidelines, to evaluate the potential for a semi-closed regional food system to satisfy the dietary requirements of the city. Results show the agriculture hinterland in most of the defined foodshed regions produce enough food to satisfy the dietary requirements of the city. Nonetheless, issues of overlapping foodsheds, competition over local resources and structural social issues complicate the development of a localized food system around major metropolitan areas. Still, while more study is needed, my findings indicate that local food systems are posed to support the development of more sound environmental, social and economic interactions within the urban and food systems, thus positively impacting the sustainability of both the urban and regional sphere.",884221159,,Dissertations & Theses," Kremer, PelegKremerPelegKremer, Peleg", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2428808651 , 63666861 , 66569 , 9781124782423 , 3465799 , 3465799", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884221159?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning",," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," Geography , Environmental Studies , Urban planning"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Gis , Local food systems , Philadelphia , Regional food systems , Remote sensing , Urban agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Local+food+systems+as+a+strategy+for+sustainability%3A+Analysis+of+a+scale+dependent+sustainable+urban+food+system+A+case+study+in+Philadelphia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kremer%2C+Peleg&amp;isbn=9781124782423&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.29181938,0.982696036,1762,Left,environmental,wildlife conservation in South Africa and Mozambique,Tracking Wildlife Conservation in Southern Africa: Histories of Protected Areas in Gorongosa and Maputaland,"In this dissertation, I argue that the development and demarcation of protected areas in southern Africa has not only been a process of defining boundaries but also of defining belonging. I focus specifically on how wildlife has been determined to belong in particular areas and how these animals have been claimed as belonging to individuals, communities, provinces, nations, and regions. I focus on the histories of wildlife conservation in Mozambique and the northern part of KwaZulu Natal, with particular emphasis on Gorongosa and Maputaland during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, a time of great social and political change in both South Africa and Mozambique. I have selected these areas not to propose points of comparison between conservation practices in these neighboring countries, but rather to demonstrate complex continuities, exchanges, and cross-fertilizations. Ideas about wildlife conservation crossed national borders, as did animals, their advocates, and, eventually, protected area boundaries. By employing a transnational perspective on protected area histories, I illustrate and analyze this movement of personnel, non-human animals, and conservation practices between nation-states. By interrogating the scientific knowledge production and policy-making of protected area development, my narrative foregrounds the ways that wildlife has been implicated in and impacted by ideas about where these animals belong and to whom. Conceptions of indigeneity and nativeness, which tie belonging to place, have impacted the territories and scales of protected areas, as well as what (or who) has the right to dwell within their borders. However, these categories of belonging are not inherent to the wildlife species they have been attributed to. Instead, â€œbelongingâ€ is a condition that is made through a complex network of biocultural interactions. It is produced through dynamic constellations of political conditions, cultural values, economic interests, scientific ways of knowing, and animal behavior.",1733693340,,Dissertations & Theses," McKeown, KathleenMcKeownKathleenMcKeown, Kathleen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3868640621 , 100252242 , 66569 , 9781339235790 , 3734824 , 3734824", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1733693340?accountid=14496," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history",," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history"," Wildlife Conservation , African Studies , Ecology , African history"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Belonging , Indigeneity , Mozambique , Protected areas , South Africa , Wildlife conservation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tracking+Wildlife+Conservation+in+Southern+Africa%3A+Histories+of+Protected+Areas+in+Gorongosa+and+Maputaland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKeown%2C+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9781339235790&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.567350259,0.977639197,624,Left,environmental,an ecological critique of capitalism,Explaining global-unevenness of environmental degradations: Monopoly economy and spatial injustice,"This dissertation presents an ecological critique of capitalism. The aim is to develop a theoretical frame that can explain globally-uneven degradations as opposed to global risks. I conceptualize the global-unevenness of environmental degradations as a problem of spatial injustice, and argue that this spatial injustice is systemically produced under the current capitalist economy, which is a global monopoly economy. In order to theorize injustice distributed along the logic of spatial hierarchy, power relations between different actors should be specified. Taking large corporations as a primary analytical unit, this dissertation theorizes the current economy in terms of monopoly power. I argue that, in an economy characterized by a high level of concentration, the market division-of-labor does not necessarily represent decentralized/uncontrolled coordination as portrayed in mainstream economics. Instead, the market is instrumentally organized by monopoly power, and the resultant market configuration is highly controlled and hierarchical, at least highly enough to avoid being regarded as subject to competitive conditions. In particular, focusing on the firm-to-firm market, I explore how large corporations actively shape their relationship with other firms in their upstream- and downstream- industries. Analysis of monopoly power reveals that, in an economy with vastly asymmetric power relations, the economic activities of large corporations that produce market-captured positive values also produce and distribute uncaptured negative values. This process of cost externalization is, I argue, the central mechanism forcing uneven distribution of environmental hazards. This dissertation, then, applies the monopoly approach to a globalized economy under neoliberalism. I argue that neoliberalism has little to do with the expansion of the competitive market principle and much to do with the global division-of-labor driven by large transnational corporations (TNCs). Based on this analysis of the global monopoly economy, I explore the social and environmental consequences that result from the cost externalization performed by TNCs through globally hierarchical production networks. If large TNCs are the power units significantly responsible for the grave degradations observed in many parts of the world, the legal immunity that TNCs are enjoying for the problems they induce requires a separate explanation. Transnational injustice is difficult to deal with especially because political systems are nationally organized while the problem at hand has a transnational quality. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) of the US provided a small opportunity to overcome the limitation of nationally-organized legal systems by allowing foreign (non-US) nationals to file their suits in the US courts. However, the ATS raised challenges to the Westphalian notion of sovereignty, and the small opening for TNC-liability provided by the ATS has shut over the last three-decade period, as those challenges were settled in such a way to reaffirm Westphalian sovereignty. By analyzing court decisions on selected ATS cases against TNCs, and with specific focus on the rationales for TNC-immunity under international law, I point out that the concept of nominal statehood based on the Westphalian ideal produces real effects that pose serious obstacles in efforts to address transnational injustice. Based on the analysis of monopoly power and its negative consequences, this dissertation also provides a critique of depoliticization trends shown in contemporary economic- and social- theories. First, I argue that mainstream economic theories adhere to the competitiveness assumption by treating corporations, regardless of their sizes, as individuals, without capturing the fact that a market dominated by large corporations operates through qualitatively different dynamics from competitive market dynamics. Economically-induced spatial injustice has thus become an irrelevant topic in mainstream economics, as the power issue, which should be a major implication drawn from the consideration of firm size, has become analytically negated. Second, this dissertation also points out how contemporary social theories, too, have lost their critical quality. I argue that social theories, both mainstream and leftist alike, came to negate the concepts of structural unevenness and antagonism in their theorization of critical consciousness and agency when they departed from the Marxist tradition of analyzing class structure. This trend is closely related to the fact that recent social theories take the rise of so-called ""new social movement"" agendas in advanced countries as their primary empirical base. Given that the problem at hand is transnational injustice, i.e. injustice that is hierarchically distributed in a globally-uneven fashion, I argue, over-generalization of the advanced world's experiences runs the risk of under-theorizing the critical consciousness that does and should develop from the unevenness itself, that is, from the experiences of the more oppressed people.",1446999248,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, SeungjinKimSeungjinKim, Seungjin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3112767581 , 82640682 , 66569 , 9781303423000 , 3595925 , 3595925", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1446999248?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0344 Social research , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Social research , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Environmental degradation , Externality , Large corporations , Monopoly economy , Neoliberalism , Spatial injustice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Explaining+global-unevenness+of+environmental+degradations%3A+Monopoly+economy+and+spatial+injustice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Seungjin&amp;isbn=9781303423000&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.055237343,0.950757066,1440,Left,environmental,food secrurity,Talking Trash: Oral Histories of Food In/Security from the Margins of a Dumpster,"This dissertation explores oral histories with dumpster divers of varying food security levels. The project draws from 15 oral history interviews selected from an 18-interview collection conducted between Spring 2008 and Summer 2010. Interviewees self-identified as divers; varied in economic, gender, sexual, and ethnic identity; and ranged in age from 18-64 years. To supplement this modest number of interviews, I also conducted 52 surveys in Summer 2010. I interview divers as theorists in their own right, and engage the specific ways in which the divers identify and construct their food choice actions in terms of individual food security and broader ecological implications of trash both as a food source and as an international residue of production, trade, consumption, and waste policy. This research raises inquiries into the gender, racial, and class dynamics of food policy, informal food economies, common pool resource usage, and embodied histories of public health and sanitation. Topically, the chapters build from Chapter 1 : ""Dumpstering the American Way of Life""--a theoretical analysis of the space of the dumpster and its social and legally stigmatized margins framed within questions of ideal citizenship and consumption. Chapter 2 : ""Situating Food in the Dumpster"" explores the possibilities of (re)imagining the dumpster-as-food-source within contexts of food in/security. Chapter 3 : ""On Twinkies, Chickpeas, and the 'Real' Food Paradigm"" is an examination of the contemporary re-visitation and application of modernist food discourses as a means of constructing alternative food paradigms in the present. I trace a particularly gendered modernist history through to contemporary food movement literature constructing 'good' food and 'real' food including works by chef-activists and scholars such as Alice Waters, Michael Pollan, Carlo Petrini, Jamie Oliver, and Marion Nestle. Chapter 4 : ""Tackling Informality: The Dumpster as Public Health Threat"" engages turn-of-the-century food specific public health measures in relation to a 'politics of clean' as it applies to the dumpster and extends to mechanisms of State control over other exemplary informal street food economies. By overlapping the oral narratives with research about food and waste policies, practices, and literature, I build an overall hypothesis. I begin by arguing that the interviews show there are broad spectrums of divers and diving narratives. Each chapter discusses varying diver experiences in relation to intertwined food, trash, and health related policies and paradigms in an attempt to thicken understandings of the dumpster and garbage as transnational material residue, as food source, and as a form of commons space.",916247848,,Dissertations & Theses," Vaughn, Rachel A.VaughnA.RachelVaughn, Rachel A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2561741391 , 62931271 , 66569 , 9781267097927 , 3489924 , 3489924", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/916247848?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history , 0619 Environmental Justice"," American studies , Modern history , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Dumpster diving , Food security , Food studies , Oral history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Talking+Trash%3A+Oral+Histories+of+Food+In%2FSecurity+from+the+Margins+of+a+Dumpster&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vaughn%2C+Rachel+A.&amp;isbn=9781267097927&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.417867,0.949238492,731,Left,environmental,Mira Behn and Sarala Behn and their roles in the evolution of Gandhian philosophy of socioeconomic reconstruction and environmental conservation,The contribution of Mira Behn and Sarala Behn to social and environmental transformation in the Indian state of Uttarakhand,"The influence of Mohandas K. Gandhi on social and environmental movements in postcolonial India has been widely acknowledged. Yet, the contributions of two European associates of Gandhi, Madeleine Slade and Catherine Mary Heilemann, better known in India as Mira Behn and Sarala Behn, have not received the due attention of the academic community. This dissertation is an examination of the philosophy and social activism of Mira Behn and Sarala Behn and their roles in the evolution of Gandhian philosophy of socioeconomic reconstruction and environmental conservation in the present Indian state of Uttarakhand. Instead of just being acolytes of Gandhi, I argue that these women developed ideas and practices that drew upon from an extensive intellectual terrain that cannot be limited to Gandhiâ€™s work. I delineate the directions in which Gandhian thought and experiments in rural development work evolved through the lives, activism, and written contributions of these two women. Particularly, I examine their influence on social and environmental movements, such as the Chipko and the Anti-Tehri Dam movements, and their roles in promoting grassroots social development and environmental sustainability in the mountain communities of Uttarakhand. Mira Behn and Sarala Behnâ€™s integrative philosophical worldviews present epistemological, sociopolitical, ethical, and metaphysical principles and practices that have local and global significance for understanding interfaith dialog, social justice, and environmental sustainability and thus constitute a useful contribution to the theory and practice of human emancipation in our times.",1668087633,,Dissertations & Theses," Mallik, BidishaMallikBidishaMallik, Bidisha", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3642061131 , 95114892 , 66569 , 9781321641196 , 3691176 , 3691176", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1668087633?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability",," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy , 0640 Sustainability"," History , Asian Studies , Environmental philosophy , Philosophy , Sustainability"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Anti-tehri dam movement , Behn mira , Behn, sarala , Chipko , Environmental philosophy , Sustainability ethics , Uttarakhand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+contribution+of+Mira+Behn+and+Sarala+Behn+to+social+and+environmental+transformation+in+the+Indian+state+of+Uttarakhand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mallik%2C+Bidisha&amp;isbn=9781321641196&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.861817653,0.948762908,1377,Left,environmental,european green party,On the development and apocalyps of the european green party,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since human society paced into the industrialized time productivity expanded rapidly. Generally speaking people's living standard rocketed in west European and other developed countries, and middle-class became the main part in the social structure. The system of social well-being and insurance was almost consummated yet, so people didn't have to worry about how to survive and living problems, and less attention is paid to personal benefit. As productivity expanded, industrial pollution, nuclear waste, imbalanced ecology attracts more and more attention. Part of the public in the developed countries has doubts about the capitalist product system. They thought that the capitalist system chasing market and profit ignored the ecology and environment, and quest a new way to change the entire society into a new one which fits the ecology.

Based on participant observation of a coffee trade show and conference, interviews with coffee retailers and roasters and content analysis of coffee trade journals, it investigates the role of the coffee retailer in translating fair trade principles and politics of consumption to potential consumers.",304406169,,Dissertations & Theses," Scannell, LaurenScannellLaurenScannell, Lauren", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1554507041 , 40344471 , 66569 , 9780494391426 , MR39142 , MR39142", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304406169?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," Agricultural economics , Social structure", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ethical+grounds+and+imagined+brew%3A++The+fair+trade+movement+and+speciality+coffee+retailers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Scannell%2C+Lauren&amp;isbn=9780494391426&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.994760714,0.930518414,1467,Left,environmental,sustainable development,Development of a Framework to Assess Sustainability of Building Projects,"The last three decades witnessed a global shift in focus towards sustainable development, primarily owing to the effects of human activities on planet earth. The resultant sustainability movement, which originated in the 1980's, has been acknowledged universally as the response to environmental, social and economic concerns facing most nations. Sustainable development, a concept which meets the needs of today without compromising the needs of future generations, is being made use of for almost all activities ranging from international mega ventures to individual projects. In this context, the building industry, which makes a significant impact on the social, environmental and economic well-being of the society, has a prime responsibility in meeting with sustainability requirements in all facets of the design, construction and operation of buildings. The concepts of green building, environmental impact assessments and the building environmental assessment methods are several means of addressing these issues, but are considered as inadequate to contend with the wider spectrum of sustainability. Currently efforts are being made by the building industry and the allied professions to adhere to sustainability norms by enhancing the current green building practices. The formulation of a measurement system to appraise the sustainability of a building project, as being attempted through this research, is one such effort at meeting with the global demand for sustainability. The inspiration for the research is created by the current sustainability efforts of the building industry, while the theoretical connotations of building design processes and existing building performance measurement systems are used as a springboard for the execution of this research. The feedback from professionals in building and allied industries makes a vital contribution in the formulation of the framework for the measurement system. While the proposed sustainability assessment framework is expected to be utilized as a tool to gauge the extent of sustainability of a building project, with time it could be further enhanced in order to keep abreast with demands of the industry. The research contributes towards formulating a best practices methodology for design of sustainable building projects, and the success of such an exercise is primarily attributed to the ability of the assessment system to serve as a guideline to deliver sustainable buildings. In order to address such concerns, the means of integrating the assessment method with a selected segment of the project delivery process is demonstrated, so that it can also serve as an application tool in the design of sustainable buildings. Accordingly, this research ventures into allied domains in the building industry, and it opens up several avenues for further research in future. The final outcome of the research is a framework for a sustainability assessment method that could be applied by owners and design teams seeking high quality, sustainable buildings as the final output of their endeavours.",1022503533,,Dissertations & Theses," Weerasinghe, Udawattage Gamini DharmagupthaWeerasingheGamini DharmagupthaUdawattageWeerasinghe, Udawattage Gamini Dharmaguptha", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2698612491 , 70124772 , 66569 , 9780494835517 , NR83551 , NR83551", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1022503533?accountid=14496," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability"," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability"," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability",," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability"," Architectural , Civil engineering , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Building projects , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Development+of+a+Framework+to+Assess+Sustainability+of+Building+Projects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weerasinghe%2C+Udawattage+Gamini+Dharmaguptha&amp;isbn=9780494835517&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.947194405,0.92175525,82,Left,environmental,organic food sectors,Organic limited: The corporate rise and spectacular change in the Canadian and *American organic food sectors,"The twentieth century saw the rise of industrialized food production in North America. In many cases, industrialized agriculture produces negative social and ecological effects. In response to the exploitive practices of industrialized agriculture, a number of counter movements emerged in the mid twentieth century, including the organic farming movement. The principles and practices of organic agriculture presented an alternative form of food production, distribution and consumption that accounted for the social and ecological costs associated with feeding mass populations. Over the last twenty years, the organic food sector has seen phenomenal growth, that challenges organic's status as a counter-movement. Food safety issues have emerged the industrialized, globalized food system prompting concerned consumers to seek alternatives, contributing to organic food's rapid market expansion. As a result of its remarkable market growth, new actors have entered the organic food sector and organic food is now part of policies and regulatory frameworks of many OECD countries. Changes in both the structure of the organic food sector and the actors involved in it have challenged organic's standing as a counter-movement to the industrialized food system, and what it means for a food to be defined as 'organic'. This thesis examines the changing political economy of the organic food sector in Canada and the US over the past twenty years. It looks at the corporatization of the organic food sector and the insertion of organic into various levels of governance, including national policy-making agendas and global trade agreements. As a result of these changes it is argued that organic has fundamentally moved away from its original status as a challenge to the status quo, and is now part of the global food regime that it once so adamantly opposed and sought to replace. By examining the pressures for changing the social and ecological principles of the organic movement, it is shown that it has effectively shifted from a social movement to an advocacy network.

However, this narrative masks a dynamic complexity as changes in the organic sector have not just been of scale but are complicit in changes to the qualitative characteristics of 'organics'. The new economic, social and political contexts in which organics are now being constructed means that it is an increasingly contested term. In this context, the thesis is primarily concerned with the transformation of British organics towards being a successful market commodity and an agricultural policy instrument. With a particular focus on the political sphere, the thesis examines the evolving engagement of the British government with the UK organic movement since 1980 and the materialisation of particular policy outcomes for organic agriculture. Given the organic movement's critique of 'conventional' farming, support from government has been mixed, although the study records a progressive shift in favour of organics. It is essential to establish why organic agriculture has become a policy issue for government and, crucially, how government has dealt with the criticism of mainstream agriculture that organics contains. The thesis identifies several 'organic agricultural policy networks' to conceptualise the changing relations between the government and other interests. The study draws on the insights of an interpretative tradition which contends that policy networks are enacted by individuals. Together, these actors have constructed three different organic 'storylines' that are constituted in the particular memberships of the policy network in temporally specific sets of circumstances. An important focus, therefore, is the way in which the actors in the network have 'acted on organics' in the making of organic policy.",1428929004,,Dissertations & Theses," Tomlinson, Isobel JaneTomlinsonJaneIsobelTomlinson, Isobel Jane", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3059340411 , 81401972 , 189128 , 9781303383298 , U593221 , U593221", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428929004?accountid=14496, 0359 Food Science, 0359 Food Science, 0359 Food Science,, 0359 Food Science, Food Science," (UMI)AAIU593221 , Biological sciences , Britain , Growth narrative , Organic food , Organic movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+British+organics%3A+the+role+of+central+government%2C+1980+-+2006&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tomlinson%2C+Isobel+Jane&amp;isbn=9781303383298&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.086702253,0.988494647,639,Left,environmental,Movimiento Campesino de Santiago del Estero (MOCASE) ,Food sovereignty as resistance: Mocase's defense of territory and indigenous campesino knowledge in argentina,"Over the past six years, the convergence of the food, climate, energy, and financial crises have contributed to a new direction of global land seizures, commonly known as land grabs. The large-scale forms of current land grabs set unprecedented records in terms of their pace and scale. Extrapolating from a broad analysis of the drivers, the actors, and the land use changes of the current ""land rush,"" the first half of the paper draws from current literature to provide a background of land grabbing in Latin America. Financial investors, agribusiness firms, foreign governments, and national elites are among the numerous actors that have exploited precarious land tenure conditions finding justification in the current global food-crisis-centric narrative. The second half of the paper further interrogates land grabs in Argentina, particularly examining soybean production in the province of Santiago del Estero. Through interviews with the agrarian social movement Movimiento Campesino de Santiago del Estero (MOCASE) in Argentina, the research aimed to understand how land grabs affect local communities and the strategies of resistance used by MOCASE. The resulting study found a discourse of resistance couched within the concept of food sovereignty. To engage farmers in the concept, the movement organized and mobilized communities to defend their territories and reclaim an indigenous collective identity. The movement works discursively and in action, by leveraging a counter-hegemonic discourse while simultaneously building an alternative agricultural model. The paper concludes with broader implications of food sovereignty on government policy and society.",1476439688,,Dissertations & Theses," Meisner, JasonMeisnerJasonMeisner, Jason", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3178078521 , 84548612 , 66569 , 9781303609152 , 1549231 , 1549231", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1476439688?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0394 Ethics , 0473 Agriculture , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Ethics , Agriculture , Latin American Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agroecology , Food sovereignty , Land grabs , Mocase , Modernization theory , Santiago del estero",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Food+sovereignty+as+resistance%3A+Mocase%27s+defense+of++territory+and+indigenous+campesino++knowledge+in+argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meisner%2C+Jason&amp;isbn=9781303609152&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.039379393,0.996734863,546,Left,ethno-racial justice,black panthers,"Lock My Body, Can't Trap My Mind: A Study of the Scholarship and Social Movements Surrounding the Case of Imprisoned Radical Mumia Abu-Jamal","In the thirty years since a death sentence was imposed on Black journalist and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, formations of civil support have organized along the lines of a social movement referred to as the â€œFree Mumiaâ€ movement. The movements which coalesce on his behalf are international in scope and have become foundations upon which to pitch battles for broader issues of economic and racial justice. Notwithstanding imprisonment, Abu-Jamal has continued his work of advocacy journalism in the form of political commentaries, broadcasted essays and published works. This outpouring of social commentary and academic production provides substance for the movement on his behalf and contributes to the bank of Black political thought. Yet for all the attention Abu-Jamalâ€™s case has provoked, and despite the movements which unite on his behalf, the Free Mumia movement, and the role of Abu-Jamalâ€™s scholarship remain understudied phenomenon. By using the reflections and experiences of thirteen individuals who have participated on campaigns for his freedom, this project identifies the trajectory of Abu-Jamalâ€™s scholarship and explores the relationship between his academic production and the movements on his behalf.

I focus on a strand of fiction and performance whose ambitious aesthetic aims both work within radical ethnic movements and exceed the identitarian strictures associated with these movements. Black Arts/Black Power, the American Indian Movement (AIM), and the multiethnic Third World Strike were profoundly transnational and cross-racial in their theory and practice, and I show how writers working within and after these movements developed experimental forms and figures that navigate between particular ethnic identities and a universalizable collective political subject. Drawing on a long-standing body of work that has shown the inseparability of politics and aesthetic form, I place revolutionary nationalist aesthetics in dialogue with a recent theoretical tradition that has reimagined universalist politics. My project traces its argument from collaborations between Henry Dumas and Sun Ra, whose play with ontological categories does not easily fit Black Arts's strongly racialized context, through the fraught relationship between Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony and AIM's political theater, to more recent retrospective accounts of nationalist movements by Karen Tei Yamashita and Jamaican novelist and anthropologist Erna Brodber. My first two chapters examine the ways that Sun Ra's 1950s streetcorner leaflets, Dumas's 1960s fiction, and Silko's narratives of natural revolution rework tropes of nature, both in order to revise the ontological ground of identity and to imagine modes of collective being. The second half of my project examines later writers who reclaim earlier movements within contexts of multiculturalism and globalization. I turn to the ways that Brodber uses depictions of spirit possession to revise Marcus Garvey's black nationalism into a model for a radical global subjectivity, and how the formal fragmentation of Yamashita's I Hotel resituates multiethnic subjectivities around their relation to global struggle. I argue that this strand of American literature offers a useful alternative to contemporary multicultural politics by developing an engaged political aesthetics that negotiates between ethnic particularity and a democratic, global commons.",1151451646,,Dissertations & Theses," Ragain, Nathan DaleRagainDaleNathanRagain, Nathan Dale", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2814315791 , 71531062 , 66569 , 9781267723376 , 3531213 , 3531213", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1151451646?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," African American Studies , American studies , Black studies , Caribbean literature , American literature , Ethnic studies , Native American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Aesthetics , Brodber, Erna , Contemporary American literature , Dumas, Henry , Ethnic American literature , Jamaica , Nationalist movements , Silko, Leslie Marmon , Sun Ra , Yamashita, Karen Tei",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Aesthetics+of+Revolutionary+Nationalism%3A+Narratives+of+Social+Movement+in+Ethnic+American+Literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ragain%2C+Nathan+Dale&amp;isbn=9781267723376&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.187727008,0.994321268,411,Left,ethno-racial justice,black movements in Colombia and Brazil,"States, movements and the new politics of blackness in Colombia and Brazil","The 1990s marked a dramatic shift throughout Latin America from constitutions and state policies that hinged on ideas of colorblindness and mestizaje to targeted policies for black and indigenous peoples. This study analyzes the role black social movements played in this shift in Colombia and Brazil, two countries where the state adopted the most comprehensive reforms for black populations in the region. It also analyzes the impact of achieving such reforms on black movements' trajectories in the two countries. In so doing, I not only examine how black movements are shaped by the political context in which they emerge, but how they are able to reconfigure that political context in ways that ultimately reshape black movements themselves. Drawing on 18 months of fieldwork including in-depth interviews, archival analysis, and ethnographic methods, this study reveals new ways of understanding ethno-racial politics in these countries and offers insights about the relationship between movements and the state, as well as contestation within movements. Further, in examining how black movements seize upon changes in the global political field, appropriate global discourses into local struggles, and build transnational alliances, this work also challenges us to integrate the constant interplay between global and local processes into our analyses, especially when our aim is to understand social movement dynamics in the Global South. In the first part of the dissertation, I show how the rise of global policy norms around multiculturalism, and the Durban World Conference against Racism, provided political openings for black movements in Colombia and Brazil, respectively. However, I maintain that it was the interplay between such global factors and national political developments paired with strategic action by black movements that best explains states' adoption of these historic reforms. Even so, while both countries adopted policies for black populations beginning in the 1990s, the dominant discourse around black rights in Brazil centers on notions of ""the right to equality"" and inclusion, whereas black issues in Colombia are largely framed in terms of the ""right to difference"", culture, territory and autonomy. I suggest that these discursive differences have as much to do with how black populations were historically imagined by the state in the two cases, as they do with the different discursive tactics used by black movements when making demands on the state. The second part examines the consequences of the shift to ethno-racial legislation on internal black movement dynamics in the two countries. More specifically, I analyze the nature of formal structures of political participation set up for black populations in response to movement pressure. I do this by examining how movement actors negotiate, inhabit and contest such spaces, revealing a reality of social movement institutionalization that is much more complex than the literature suggests. Whereas black movements in Brazil have been absorbed into mainstream politics within a relatively democratic state, black movements in Colombia have either been repressed violently or institutionalized into precarious alternative political structures leading to unique internal movement dynamics. In order to understand the relationship between structure and agency as well as ntional and international political processes in these two cases, I propose the conceptual framework of national and global political fields which I argue contributes both to the literature on race in Latin America and social movements.",1525820678,,Dissertations & Theses," Paschel, Tianna ShontaPaschelShontaTiannaPaschel, Tianna Shonta", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3307435781 , 87679742 , 66569 , 9781303829574 , 3616147 , 3616147", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1525820678?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0296 African American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," African American Studies , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Affirmative action , Globalization , Latin america , Multiculturalism , Race and ethnicity , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=States%2C+movements+and+the+new+politics+of+blackness+in+Colombia+and+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paschel%2C+Tianna+Shonta&amp;isbn=9781303829574&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.807233153,0.989923344,1558,Left,ethno-racial justice,AfAfm cinema as a cultural movement,"Envisioned communities: African American life and the moving pictures, 1896â€“1927","This dissertation investigates the role of cinema in the modern black experience and the generative role that African Americans played in the creation of American modernity. Two questions animate this study. First, how did African Americans consolidate their institutions and social bonds amid the distending forces of turn-of-the-century migration? Second, how and why did cinemaâ€”as a location, medium, and set of practicesâ€”become so important to the collective articulation of black identity in the early twentieth century? By mapping the patterns of turn-of-the-century migration with the development of black cinema practices from 1896 to 1927, this project traces black economic, social, and cultural practices across space and time. It begins in the post-Reconstruction period, when African Americans looked inward to fortifying the institutions that stood at the center of black life. Yet at the same time, hundreds of thousands of black migrants were departing the countryside for the urban South and West. At this curious juncture when black life was both turning inward and expanding outward, African Americans used film as a tool for collective racial progress. Black churches, halls, and schools hosted moving picture exhibitions, which brought the race together and raised money for the construction of buildings that conspicuously demonstrated black material progress. Eventually black film exhibition moved into colored theaters, which became celebrated monuments of black life and public claims to urban space in the Jim Crow city. During this time, African Americans associated race and cinema primarily with tangible, physical locations. Yet when colored theaters started to compete with black religious institutions, middle class blacks were forced to reconsider the ideas of racial uplift, which championed both piety and black-owned businesses. After 1910, a series of eventsâ€”including Jack Johnsonâ€™s victory as heavyweight champion of the worldâ€”further shifted the focus from the exhibition site to the screen. Black conceptions of freedom and natural rights based on new sensibilities of racial representation informed the first mass protest movement of African Americans in the twentieth century as well as transnational formations of racial identity articulated by the race film industry.",1283100316,,Dissertations & Theses," Caddoo, CaraCaddooCaraCaddoo, Cara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2879607441 , 75064602 , 66569 , 9781267851475 , 3549040 , 3549040", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1283100316?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," African American Studies , Black history , American history , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Black church , Black institutional life , Cinema , Leisure , Migration , Visual culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Envisioned+communities%3A+African+American+life+and+the+moving+pictures%2C+1896%E2%80%931927&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Caddoo%2C+Cara&amp;isbn=9781267851475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.294268832,0.985012279,259,Left,ethno-racial justice,Cuban revolution,"The circulation of transatlantic ideas and people in Cuban slave society, 1791-1844","This dissertation explores the circulation of people and ideas in Cuba during the Age of Revolutions. It analyzes how the mobility of political, anti-slavery, and abolitionist ideas, and the traffic of people who espoused these kinds of ideas, influenced Cuban colonial authorities' efforts at social control. Conversely, it also examines the impact these ideas had on free people of color and slaves in Cuba during the period 1791 to 1844, exploring the connection between ideologies of liberty, freedom, and equality and popular resistance. The central claim is that slaves and free people of color developed popular networks of communication and mobility that operated outside of the colonial government's scope of authority and challenged efforts at social control. As social spaces beyond the purview of authorities, these networks provided free blacks and slaves the opportunities to learn of and engage with transnational ideas. Moreover, people of African descent, slave and free, utilized their experiences of living in Cuban slave society to radicalize the transnational ideas they appropriated from the Atlantic world, including memories brought to the Caribbean by some African-born slaves. This project treats the movement of people and ideas as a serious subject of historical inquiry, tracing when, how, and under what conditions ideas reached slaves and free people of color, and uncovering points of contact between these subordinate groups and transatlantic ideas.",304853615,,Dissertations & Theses," Paul, Eric A.PaulA.EricPaul, Eric A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1917155531 , 49777851 , 66569 , 9781109487398 , 3379637 , 3379637", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304853615?accountid=14496," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0582 Modern history"," Caribbean Studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Age of Revolutions , Atlantic world , Colonial Cuba , Cuba , Free people of color , Popular resistance , Slavery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+circulation+of+transatlantic+ideas+and+people+in+Cuban%0Aslave+society%2C+1791-1844&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paul%2C+Eric+A.&amp;isbn=9781109487398&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.491118458,0.982726647,825,Left,ethno-racial justice,Cuban civil rights movement,"Binding Freedom: Cuba's Black Public Sphere, 1868-1912","My dissertation studies the cultural, social, and political associations linked to the civil rights movement in Cuba during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which witnessed the abolition of slavery, the crumbling of colonialism and the entrance of black intellectuals into formal politics. I trace the emergence of a black public sphere and analyze the networks of communication among people of color in Cuba and the wider Black Atlantic through sources that include antislavery narratives, the black press, court cases and secret police records. I argue that people of color in Cuba, enslaved and freed alike, engaged in political and intellectual activity throughout the nineteenth century and played a much more active role in shaping the way race relations, blackness and Cuban identity were formed than intellectual and political histories tend to show. A driving question of â€œBinding Freedomâ€ is how collective consciousness is articulated through print culture and converted into social movements. Thus a major thrust of the study centers on the limitations of antislavery narratives as well as the social and economic hurdles the black press encountered and of the ways in which the consumers and producers of the papers negotiated these difficulties. The second half of the project focuses on the transition from colonialism to â€œcolorblind republicanismâ€ to map how the black press and civic organizations adapted their discourse and tactics to confront new forms of social and political oppression.

The use of hip hop as public performance has been the most recent occurrence in reclaiming a sense of free cultural expression and immediate communication and interactions with the public. Historically, U.S. hip hop, and the development of its four elements, DJ, breaking, MC, and graffiti, have encouraged street culture and public street performances as a way to reclaim public space, and inform on-lookers to the social inequalities produced with a spatial-temporal awareness (Baker, p. 218). Non-U.S. hip hop has not deviated from this phenomenon, and in many cases has significant, politicized hip hop movements that have flourished. Many Cuban and Brazilian rappers and artists are creating more provocative, street displays of expression that elucidate the contradictions of daily existence in marginalized, neglected communities. For this reason, Cuban and Brazilian hip hop both have the uniqueness of these incorporations and contradictions in hip hop expression, based on the fact that both Cuban and Brazilian governments are promoting hip hop culture. This dissertation examines the use of hip hop inspired street performance as both hidden and public transcript. James C. Scott in Domination and the Arts of Resistance defines these two terms as methods that are employed by power entities exercising control over discourse through cultural manifestation. The dissertation will be contextualized in this framework. What is of concern for this dissertation is how Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian youth and other hip hop-influenced youth in these countries exert public spatial control under specific historic and contemporary circumstances where social contradictions are growing between whites and non-Whites, artists and governing bodies. I will utilize hip hop street culture and spoken word, performance art as a performative, corporal expression that has received financial support from the Cuban and Brazilian government, while at the same time has remained community-based in both countries. Nongovernmentally-supported hip hop street performance has allowed some artists the liberty to bypass cultural institutions and other avenues of official and national artistic recognition, for instance, seeking other benefactors to support their work. Despite this, artists, participators, and rappers are ""playing"" various political alliances and employing both hidden and public transcripts to benefit from the increasing support of the art form, and in the case of Alamar, Cuba and Salvador, Brazil performers, are producing socially ""conscious"" artistic manifestations in public places for specific audiences with specific intentions and objectives. In many cases these performers seek not only to produce personal art that usually has an activist intent that also benefits the government sponsored financial support of ""rebel"" music culture, but to also allay hidden transcripts to the communities in the audience who pick up on its subtleties. I will contextualize these ideas through an analysis of national identity and history, and how culture and identity have historically informed social justice and values in the racially and socially polarized societies of Havana/Alamar and Salvador. Hip hop will then be analyzed as a public resource (YÃºdice, p. 9). Hip hop culture allows participating communities to share in the global public discourse of social transcendence and power (Pardue, Ideologies, p. 24). Public performance also arms artists with a wider arsenal of material. It also gives a sense to audience members that they are participating in a resource of social integration and increasing political momentum (Baker, p. 240). This dissertation will describe how Afro-Brazilian and Afro-Cuban communities use hip hop to publicly and creatively express their local concerns through a politics of culture in the commercial arena of ""the street"". This cultural politics is then incorporated into other affiliations with the state or socio-political movements and used for specific purposes within these two countries. Many artists negotiate with these institutions, while maintaining a cultural autonomy and a critical quality to their work.

Turning first to work by W. E. B. Du Bois and C. L. R. James, I demonstrate that the problem of the color line was a significant public relations burden for the United States at a time when both the Soviet Union and nations of color (India, China) pointed repeatedly to the failings of the self-appointed leader of the free world. The United States government tried to manage or â€œspinâ€ the global scandal of American racism by sponsoring performers who would preach the benefits of capitalist democracy overseas. These propaganda ventures were somewhat successful in generating positive images of race relations in the United States, yet they were also, ironically enough, productive of a new kind of black oppositionality. Reading closely performances by Louis Armstrong, James Baldwin, William Faulkner (and his black interlocutors), and the players of a touring production of Porgy and Bess , I argue that African American cultural producers and intellectuals recognized in the government's propaganda program an opportunity to stage their own counterpropaganda theaterâ€”a counterpropaganda theater that typically involved exposing the nation to even more international critique. By reminding other nations that the United States somehow could not find a way to enfranchise its black citizens, these intellectuals and cultural producers placed pressure on the government to work for social change. For example, I demonstrate that through the clever use of a well-publicized challenge to the state, Louis Armstrong may have played a role in Eisenhower's intervention during the Little Rock desegregation crisis. Such counterpropaganda performances also played an important role within the African American community at home. The enormous black newspaper and magazine coverage devoted to black counterpropaganda performances by Armstrong and Baldwin suggests that such media-savvy and internationally-oriented performers helped construct the alternative black public sphere that would sustain the black struggle during the 1950s and 1960s.",304530779,,Dissertations & Theses," Stecopoulos, HarilaosStecopoulosHarilaosStecopoulos, Harilaos", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730199161 , 30479801 , 66569 , 9780599507845 , 0599507845 , 9948503 , 9948503", Dissertation/Thesis,1999," 9780599507845 , 0599507845", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304530779?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science"," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science"," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science",," 0591 American literature , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0328 Black history , 0615 Political science"," American literature , American history , International law , International relations , Black history , Political science"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Cultural politics , Nation , Propaganda , Race",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+world+elsewhere%3A++United+States+propaganda+and+the+cultural+politics+of+race+and+nation%2C+1945--1968&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stecopoulos%2C+Harilaos&amp;isbn=9780599507845&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.265398759,0.959279836,3006,Left,ethno-racial justice,natural childbirth movement,"The politics of reproduction: Childbirth, health care and culture in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia","What does the concept of culture mean to health care professionals working in the maternity ward of a Lower Mainland hospital? What does the current model of maternity care with its focus on self-care and natural childbirth reveal about the larger social processes and cultural metaphors? The material of this thesis is based on one month of intensive fieldwork in the maternity ward of Richmond hospital and 10 semi-structured interviews with nurses, doctors, and educators. In Part 1, I focus on the meanings ascribed to culture in the context of health care restructuring, immigration, and transnational racism. I contend that these â€œlocalâ€ meanings of culture reflect broader social, economic and political processes, as well as historical patterns of racism and discrimination. In Part 2, I focus on the natural childbirth discourse, and the ways in which key concepts of the natural childbirth movement have been incorporated into biomedical knowledge and practice. This section emphasizes the production of knowledge and the process through which certain meanings become â€œofficialâ€ or â€œauthoritativeâ€, rather than the evaluation of models of birth care. This thesis may be useful to health care professionals concerned with the underutilization of the health care system by immigrant populations.

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, South Asians and African Americans learned from each other in ways that not only advanced their respective struggles for freedom, but also helped define what freedom could and should mean. This transnational exchange did not entail the clean transfer of ideas, practices, or identities. Rather, a bi-directional process of self-transformation through self-recognition bridged struggles that were themselves internally diverse. Looking abroad and seeing oneself involved reflection in both senses of the wordâ€”a partial mirroring and a great amount of thought and practice. This work focuses on the evolution and political significance of two analogiesâ€”one comparing African Americans with all colonized subjects of the British Raj and the other comparing African Americans with Dalits (â€œUntouchablesâ€). These analogies, always political, increasingly became enmeshed in global power politics, especially during the Second World War and the Cold War. While assessing the elisions and missed opportunities involved in analogizing disparate social and political movements, this dissertation argues that an unrecognized continuity of exchange linked African Americans and South Asians in opposition to what many understood as the intersection of racism, imperialism, and oppressions based on caste, class, and gender. Analyzing these historical exchanges, this thesis contributes to scholarly debates regarding diaspora, cosmopolitanism, racial formation, anti-colonial and post-colonial nationalisms, nonviolent civil disobedience, Afro-Indian solidarity, the origins of the Third World, and the relationship between the Cold War and the American Civil Rights Movement.",304892550,,Dissertations & Theses," Slate, NicoSlateNicoSlate, Nico", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1853258161 , 48372761 , 66569 , 9781109256864 , 3365439 , 3365439", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304892550?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure",," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," Black history , History , American history , Modern history , Social structure"," Social sciences , African-American , Caste , Cold war civil rights , Colored cosmopolitanism , India , Race , Racial diplomacy , South Asian , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reflections+of+freedom%3A+Race%2C+caste%2C+and+the+shared+struggle%0Afor+democracy+in+the+United+States+and+India%2C+1914%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Slate%2C+Nico&amp;isbn=9781109256864&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.366651277,0.952555786,191,Left,ethno-racial justice,racial and ethnic identity formation among Japanese Americans,When the diaspora returns: Transnational racial and ethnic identity formation among Japanese Americans in global Tokyo,"This dissertation examines how Japanese Americans reconstruct their racial and ethnic identities through migration to Japan. Using a transnational framework, I show how identity constructions in Japan emerge from a combination of new experiences interacting with people in Japan, and past experiences in the United States that continue to shape self-perceptions. I use the case of Japanese Americans in Japan to reconsider how the concepts of race and ethnicity can be used to develop a comparative framework for discussing global constructions of race and ethnicity. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork in Japan, including 50 qualitative interviews with Japanese Americans living in the Tokyo area. Japanese American migration to Japan is a specific type of transnational movement: that of an ethnic group to its ancestral homeland. As a framework for comparatively discussing multiple constructions of Japaneseness in the United States and Japan, to flesh out the complexities of Japanese American â€œethnic returnâ€ experiences in Japan, I theorize â€œJapaneseâ€ as what I call a heterogeneous global ethnic group â€”an ethnic group that spans national borders and is internally diverse. This concept is similar to the notion of diaspora in some ways but can enable a discussion of Japanese American migration to Japan that diaspora cannot. Three types of identity formations among Americans of Japanese ancestry in Japan can be discerned. First, Japanese Americans from the U.S. continent who can phenotypically blend into Japanese society tend to reconstruct what I term â€œracialized national identitiesâ€ as â€œJapanese Americansâ€ in Japan. Second, ethnic Japanese from Hawai'i reconstruct â€œHawai'iâ€ identities while in Japan. Finally, mixed race Japanese Americans must grapple with the category of â€œhÄfu,â€ which is gaining increasing social recognition in Japan.",304599088,,Dissertations & Theses," Yamashiro, Jane HisaYamashiroHisaJaneYamashiro, Jane Hisa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1591792201 , 40988701 , 66569 , 9780549787853 , 3326464 , 3326464", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304599088?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Asian-American , Ethnic identity , Globalization , Japan , Race & ethnicity , Tokyo , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+the+diaspora+returns%3A++Transnational+racial+and+ethnic+identity+formation+among+Japanese+Americans+in+global+Tokyo&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yamashiro%2C+Jane+Hisa&amp;isbn=9780549787853&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.237674259,0.918464034,3622,Left,ethno-racial justice,Black and Japanese American struggles for racial equality in the 20th century,Transforming Los Angeles: Black and Japanese American struggles for racial equality in the 20th century,"Over the course of the 20th century, exponential economic and population growth transformed Los Angeles into a global city with a multi-ethnic population. Racial and ethnic diversity were the product of the capitalist economy's increased reliance on non-white labor and the efforts of communities of color to carve out a space for themselves in the city. Race and class interacted in the construction of a structure of inequality that was produced and reproduced not simply by hierarchichal relations of production but through residential segregation and through a contestation over urban space. Prior to World War II, the Japanese American and African American communities remained predominantly under the leadership of ethnic elites, who subscribed to the philosophy racial uplift. In response to the segregation produced during the suburbanization of the city, middle-class ethnic leaders promoted the idea of housing â€œimprovementâ€ to distinguish themselves from their less fortunate brethren and improve relations with whites. However, white resistance to integration, limited the effectiveness of the â€œimprovementâ€ strategy. Struggles for racial progress through employment generated broader participation. The general rejection of minorities by organized labor pushed Japanese American workers to greater dependence on the ethnic economy, while African Americans were moved to mass political action for public sector and defenese-industry employment. It was only with the dramatic emergence of social movement unionism in the CIO during World War II that the fight for racial equality became integral to organized labor. However, the unity that made the wartime advances possible dissipated under the pressure of Cold War politics. While the social conditions of black and Japanese Americans diverged considerably in the postwar era, community leaders united behind an integrationist agenda. Integrationists achieved success in breaking down discriminatory legal barriers but ultimately failed to dismantle the structural bases of inequality. The pent-up frustration caused by concentrated poverty and segregation exploded in the Watts Rebellion. Japanese Americans came to be identified as a â€œmodel minority,â€ whose acceptance into the middle-class validated mainstream society's claim to being â€œcolorblindâ€ while signifying that the hardship of blacks was self-produced.",304581774,,Dissertations & Theses," Kurashige, Scott TadaoKurashigeTadaoScottKurashige, Scott Tadao", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727709811 , 19230831 , 66569 , 9780599850781 , 0599850787 , 9979064 , 9979064", Dissertation/Thesis,2000," 9780599850781 , 0599850787", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304581774?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0337 American history , 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American history , Black history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Black struggle , California , Japanese-American , Los Angeles , Racial equality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+Los+Angeles%3A++Black+and+Japanese+American+struggles+for+racial+equality+in+the+20th+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kurashige%2C+Scott+Tadao&amp;isbn=9780599850781&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.95152347,0.91598262,1693,Left,ethno-racial justice,Civil Rights in Cold War Chicago,"Contentious Cosmopolitans: Black Public History and Civil Rights in Cold War Chicago, 1942-1972","This dissertation looks at how teachers, unionists, and cultural workers used black history to offer new ways of thinking about racial knowledge from a local level. Numerous efforts to promote and teach this history demonstrated how dissident cosmopolitan political currents from previous decades remained relevant to a vibrant and ideologically diffuse African American public sphere despite widespread Cold War dispersions, white supremacist reactions, and anticommunist repressions. My argument proceeds by demonstrating how these public history projects coalesced around a series of connected pedagogical endeavors. These endeavors included the work of school teachers on Chicago's South side who tried to advance curriculum reforms through World War II and afterwards, the work of packinghouse workers and other union-focused educators who used anti-discrimination campaigns to teach about the history of African Americans and Mexican Americans in the labor movement and to advance innovative models for worker education, and the activities of important cultural workers like Margaret and Charles Burroughs who politicized urban space and fought for greater recognition of black history in the public sphere through the advancement of their vision for a museum. Collectively, these projects expressed important ideas about race, citizenship, education and intellectual labors that engaged closely with the rapidly shifting terrains of mid-20th Century civil rights and international anti-colonialisms. Ultimately, this dissertation offers a social history about how cosmopolitan cultural work in public history and similar forms of knowledge production were at the intersections of political realities and lived experience in U.S. urban life.",1634881183,,Dissertations & Theses," Rocksborough-Smith, Ian MaxwellRocksborough-SmithMaxwellIanRocksborough-Smith, Ian Maxwell", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3521594051 , 92319412 , 66569 , 9781321397406 , 3666649 , 3666649", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1634881183?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , African american studies , Black history , Chicago , Civil rights , Cold war , Cosmopolitanism , Cultural workers , Mid-20th century , Midwest , Politics , Public history , Race , Southside , U.s. communism , United states , Urban",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contentious+Cosmopolitans%3A+Black+Public+History+and+Civil+Rights+in+Cold+War+Chicago%2C%0A1942-1972&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rocksborough-Smith%2C+Ian+Maxwell&amp;isbn=9781321397406&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.578297867,0.90868245,1915,Left,ethno-racial justice,"Red Pulp progressive, anti-racist literary movment","Red pulp: Repression and radicalism in mid-twentieth century United States ""genre"" fiction","Red Pulp recuperates, resituates, and re-evaluates the voluminous mid-century mass culture production of a series of once-popular, subsequently suppressed left-wing U.S. writers of ""genre"" fiction. More specifically, it is to date the first full-length, close study of three different re-emerging progressive, anti-racist writers of this period: Guy Endore, Paul William Ryan, and Len Zinberg. Doubly derided by critics and censors as ""Red"" and as ""pulp"" writers, the subjects of my study deserve critical and popular reconsideration, I argue, for reasons political, historical, and literary. All three writers' work defies current categorizations of American Left writing, combining, in heretofore unnoticed ways, explicitly radical, proletarian and anti-racist social commentary, modernist formal experimentation, and sensational, at times seemingly conservative, even reactionary aspects of ""pulp""â€”that is, hard-boiled, detective, adventure, and horror fiction. My study of these writers' varied work, work which was often produced under pseudonyms, and in contexts conditioned by political persecution, calls into question prevalent historical notions of how the ""Old"" Left related to mass culture, how it thought about race, racism, and imperialism, and of how successfully the Communist cultural Left's opposition to U.S. racism was ""silenced"" during the Cold War. In chapter one I critically review the scholarly literature regarding the generic tendencies, limitations, and politics of ""pulp fiction"" as a subset of mass-cultural forms. I engage with Marxist cultural theorists such as Fredric Jameson, Ernest Mandel, Antonio Gramsci, and Teodor Adorno, as well as figures within and American and cultural studies such as Michael Denning, and recent reader-response, and working-class studies interpreters of pulp fiction, such as Erin Smith. Synthesizing and complicating each of these theorists take on pulp, I argue for an understanding of pulp fiction as a contradictory medium for the articulation of left-wing politics to an American mass audience in the early-to-mid Twentieth Century. I further track this account of pulp fiction in relationship to the ongoing literary-historical recovery and revaluating work being done on the U.S. Literary Left. Barbara Foley, Denning, Alan Wald and others in this vein have documented and begun to map the complicated and long-suppressed terrain of American literary radicalism of the mid-20 th century. Red Pulp is an effort to complicate and expand our understanding of proletarian or revolutionary American fiction beyond the overly narrow notion of the term currently either affirmed (or more often, dismissed) by contemporary scholars and critics of the period. In each subsequent chapter of Red Pulp, I examine these left literary works in close detail. I demonstrate in each case how the work of Endore, Zinberg, and Ryan, is sophisticated, self-reflexive, and ironic in ways not previously noticed. I further argue that returning left-wing, Jewish, and working-class writers, such as Guy Endore, Len Zinberg, and Paul William Ryan, to the ""pulp"" contexts and discourses where they belong forces us to rethink the status of these popular discourses and their historical development. In chapters two through four I turn to the life and works of Guy Endore, author of among other novels, the best-selling horror ""classic"" Werewolf of Paris (1933) and Babouk (1934), a sensational, experimental historical novel about the Haitian Revolution. Endore's work and its reception reveal both the tremendous possibilities but also the formidable dangers and limitations of appropriating conservative established mass-cultural generic confines for ""progressive"" ends. Positioning Endore biographically, politically, and discursively, in part through the examination of materials unearthed by original archival research at the Endore Papers held at UCLA, I argue that he occupied a productively liminal location within/without the burgeoning American mass culture industries, and the growing Communist-led cultural movement of the Depression. In each of these three chapters I position Endore's work in relationship to a different mass-popular genre; historical fiction, horror fiction, US colonialist writing on Haiti, respectively. In chapters five and six I turn to the work of Paul William Ryan, who maintained dual, concurrentâ€”and I argue, interrelatedâ€”writing careers: as a West Coast proletarian journalist, political poet, and pamphleteer, under the name ""Mike Quin,"" and as a successful writer of pulp fiction novels immediately after WWII and on the cusp of the Cold War under the pseudonym ""Robert Finnegan."" In chapter seven and eight I examine the voluminous literary production of Len Zinberg, better known as international best-selling pulp writer, ""Ed Lacy."" Zinberg's early works such as his anti-racist boxing thriller Walk Hard-Talk Loud (1939), and his critical bilndungsroman of an ex-radical journalist, Hold with the Hares (1947) reveal sophisticated but explicit left-critiques of American society, while his later pulp works maintain a subtle, subversive, at time subdued, but nonetheless consistent left commentary on U.S. post-war racism, imperialism, and American Big Business.

The case studies for this research are the relationship between the Black Panther Party and the U.S. government, particularly in New York City; and the Black Power Movement and the Jamaican Labor Party government in Kingston, Jamaica. The Jamaican case study also examines the relationship between the People's National Party government, elected in 1972, and the U.S. government. The period of focus of this work is between 1964 and 1976. The evidence for the U.S. case was obtained through the examination of issues of the Black Panther, the ""Black Extremist"" file of the Federal Bureau of investigation, interviews with former Black Panther Party members, and various secondary sources. The evidence for the Jamaican case was obtained through interviews with former Black Power activists and associates of the People's National Party, in addition to secondary sources and newspaper articles. The analytical approach of this work is guided by, what I call, the political implications approach, which focuses on the role of the combination of the political consciousness and actions of movements in shaping the nature of their relationships with dominant institutions. The evidence in this work indicates that the consciousness and actions of the Jamaican Black Power Movement and the Black Panther Party led to a repressive response from the state rather than an embracing or co-opting one. Although the People's National Party in Jamaica actually came to maintain control of the state in the wake of the Black Power Movement, its consciousness and actions led to repression from a more powerful state force outside of its boundaries--the U.S. government, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency. Outside of consciousness and actions, various contextual factors influenced these repressive relationships, such as race, class and political economy, the international context, the local historical context, the relative power of states, and the internal capacity of movements.",304275681,,Dissertations & Theses," Maurrasse, David JeffreyMaurrasseJeffreyDavidMaurrasse, David Jeffrey", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 743140381 , 19783061 , 66569 , 9632743 , 9632743", Dissertation/Thesis,1996,, English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304275681?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0325 African Americans , 0700 Social structure"," 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0325 African Americans , 0700 Social structure"," 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0325 African Americans , 0700 Social structure",," 0328 Black history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0325 African Americans , 0700 Social structure"," Black history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , African Americans , Social structure"," Social sciences , Black Panther Party , Black Power Movement , social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revolutionary+enough%3A++Black+power+and+state+repression+New+York%2C+United+States+of+America+and+Kingston%2C+Jamaica%2C+1964--1976&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maurrasse%2C+David+Jeffrey&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.742855023,0.977506321,3491,Right,fascism,Nazism,Nazi apocalypticism as a response to rapid and radical change,"Many Nazis perceived Weimar Germany to be a period of chaos, where all political, economic, social and cultural order was turned upside down. This chaos was in turn interpreted as reflecting an imminent apocalypse. They believed that Germany had arrived at a historic turning point, and foresaw the dawn of a New Age--the Third Reich. The Nazis believed themselves to be a chosen elite, led by a God-sent messianic Fuhrer. Their Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler revealed the way to salvation through what I have termed his soteriology of race. It was the divine mission of Aryan humanity to annihilate the ""satanic Jew"" in an eschatological battle that was to be final and decisive. The ""Final Solution"" accomplished, the millennial Third Reich could begin. My research in the cross-cultural and interdisciplinary literature of apocalypticism indicates that it is a global phenomenon occurring across cultural and temporal epochs. The common causal factor among these movements is that all occur in cultures undergoing rapid and radical change. The only factor that can explain such a cross-cultural and atemporal phenomenon is the shared genetic foundation of the human brain, which has changed little for millennia. Therefore I have created a psychohistorical model, utilizing the archetypal theories of C. G. Jung. It is the contention of this thesis that the psychological theories of Jung, which posit an objective psyche, in other words, a psyche which contains non-personal elements, may provide researchers with a much needed tool for analyzing collective behavior in historical contexts. What I have termed the apocalypse complex is a common psychological response to stress generated by rapid and radical change. When societies undergo such drastic changes, normal external ordering factors such as family, work, and social and religious institutions are considerably weakened. The apocalypse complex reconstructs order and gives meaning through the production of a standard set of symbols (messiah, New Age and past Golden Age, eternal peace and prosperity, unity, timelessness). These symbols are reflective of the ordering power of the Self, Jung's psychological construct for the internal ordering factor of the psyche.",304199297,,Dissertations & Theses," Redles, DavidRedlesDavidRedles, David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 742699231 , 30670021 , 66569 , 9612818 , 9612818", Dissertation/Thesis,1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304199297?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology"," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology",," 0335 European history , 0582 History , 0320 Religious history , 0451 Social psychology"," European history , History , Religious history , Social psychology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Psychology , Germany",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nazi+apocalypticism+as+a+response+to+rapid+and+radical+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Redles%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.332648109,0.990090508,3541,Left,feminism,"women soldiers, women's citizenship, feminist antimilitarism, patriarchal military","Brutal responsibilities and second-class citizens: Women soldiers, martial citizenship, and feminist anti-militarism","This dissertation addresses women's incorporation to the United States' armed forces by placing it in political, historical, and social context. From common roots in the women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s, women have been approaching the military from two perspectives: feminist antimilitarists have been criticizing the military for its masculinist culture, while women interested in joining the military have insisted that it is their right to participate, and that the military is the sine qua non of full citizenship. This project explores a series of questions about women soldiers, women's citizenship, feminist antimilitarism, and the culture of patriarchal militarism to untangle some of the interesting and troublesome questions about women and the military. The method of analysis used in the dissertation is interdisciplinary, combining historiography, sociology, ethnography, and political theory in the United States' context to view a series of historical moments in congressional testimony, court cases addressing equality, feminist movements for equality, feminist antimilitarist perspectives on and responses to the military, and histories of martial citizenship, including women's. These materials are investigated for their political importance in shaping public understandings of the military as gendered, for their importance in building a discourse of expanded citizenship claims, and for their contributions to shifting the terrain of citizenship and equality. The dissertation suggests, in view of these materials, that feminist scholars of the military, and of militarism, must account for the changing demographics of the armed forces by examining the contested meanings of citizenship, the effects of technological advances, and the economic imperatives that together comprise the conditions through which women access advancement in the military. Furthermore, the dissertation demonstrates that women's entry to the military is a critical juncture for several reasons: (1) It is a challenge to the structured masculinity of military culture, (2) It informs studies of the international economies in which women become the primary, but low-waged, workers, and (3) It marks a need for feminist antimilitarists to re-evaluate their approach to the topics of soldiering, women, and peace.",304332588,,Dissertations & Theses," Feinman, Ilene RoseFeinmanRoseIleneFeinman, Ilene Rose", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 740127771 , 28358181 , 66569 , 0591484099 , 9780591484090 , 9738149 , 9738149", Dissertation/Thesis,1997," 0591484099 , 9780591484090", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304332588?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies"," American studies , American history , Political science , Womens studies"," Social sciences , soldiers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Brutal+responsibilities+and+second-class+citizens%3A+Women+soldiers%2C+martial+citizenship%2C+and+feminist+anti-militarism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feinman%2C+Ilene+Rose&amp;isbn=0591484099&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.134783051,0.981654576,3647,Left,feminism,gender politics in Uruguay,"'the right to have rights': gender politics, citizenship and the state in uruguay","The thesis comprises a historically-grounded analysis of gender politics in Uruguay. It analyses the extent to which women have been able to establish a controlling presence in politics - in terms of entry of institutional arenas and of the representation of their interests in the political agenda and policy-making process - by exploring the interplay between structure, discourse and agency. The first chapter provides a historical perspective, showing how, in the context of the construction of the modern state in Uruguay, the progressive social justice discourse of the hegemonic political sector together with pressure by organised women's groups led to early reforms promoting women's rights. The second chapter examines how the second-wave women's movement emerged, initially as part of the wider civil opposition to the military dictatorship (1973-1984), and then as a political actor in its own right, to press for the inclusion of its gender-specific demands as part of the democratic project. The final four chapters analyse the development of gender politics in different political arenas - the legislature, state and political parties - in the post-dictatorship period (1985-1997). The thesis argues that the continuing obstacles to the representation of women and their interests in politics are partly the result of persistent traditional assumptions about gender roles, but derive principally from the nature of the political system itself and changing conceptualisations of citizenship and state-civil society relations, influenced by the neo-liberal doctrine of individual liberty and minimal state intervention. By constructing unity in diversity as a collective political actor, developing a rights-based discourse and using international legal instruments for lobbying, the women's movement has won some institutional space and achieved the politicisation of certain gender issues, although these gains are far from consolidated.",1771771545,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, Charlotte NicolaJohnsonNicolaCharlotteJohnson, Charlotte Nicola", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3976465261 , 102765202 , 101309 , U156061 , U156061", Dissertation/Thesis,2001,, English, English,,2001,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1771771545?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU156061 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27the+right+to+have+rights%27%3A+gender+politics%2C+citizenship+and+the+state+in+uruguay&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Charlotte+Nicola&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.51011179,0.976909786,3688,Left,feminism,profeminism men in the US,"Profeminist men in the American Progressive era in the autobiographies of Margaret Sanger, Jane Addams, and Edith Wharton","Historically, the collective participation of men in the American women's movement has been met with criticism, if not condemnation, from the feminist majority. Despite feminist opposition, profeminist men, a contingent of the patriarchy, have worked individually to support women's causes. During the American Progressive era, the autobiographies of birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, social reformer Jane Addams, and novelist Edith Wharton reveal that the early influence of profeminist patriarchs in the private sphere prefigured their collaboration with profeminist mentors in the public sphere. These men contributed to the success of Sanger, Addams, and Wharton by providing intellectual and literary mentorship, organizational and financial resources, and domestic and emotional support. The autobiographies of these Progressive feminist writers illuminate a more global and striking reality: that profeminist men play a significant supporting role alongside the matriarchy and the sisterhood in collaborating with feminist women to construct a more egalitarian culture.",230758831,,Dissertations & Theses," Lednicky, Julia NelsonLednickyNelsonJuliaLednicky, Julia Nelson", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727232671 , 28625851 , 66569 , 9780493640822 , 0493640827 , 1409092 , 1409092", Dissertation/Thesis,2002," 9780493640822 , 0493640827", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/230758831?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Profeminist+men+in+the+American+Progressive+era+in+the+autobiographies+of+Margaret+Sanger%2C+Jane+Addams%2C+and+Edith+Wharton&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lednicky%2C+Julia+Nelson&amp;isbn=9780493640822&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.531405025,0.975936991,1593,Left,feminism,women's movements in Brazil,"Tracing feminisms in Brazil: Locating gender, race, and global power relations in &lt;i&gt;Revista Estudos Feministas&lt;/i&gt; publications","Womenâ€™s movements and feminisms in Brazil have taken various forms throughout the years, contributing significantly to socio-political actions that favor gender justice. However, Brazilian feminisms remain on the margins of American academic discourse. In the United States, conceptualizations of feminism are often complicated by epistemological practices that treat certain political actions as feminist while dismissing others. The invisibility of Brazilian feminisms within feminist scholarship in the United States, therefore, justifies the need for further research on the topic. My research focuses on feminist articles published by Revista Estudos Feministas , one of the oldest and most well known feminist journals in Brazil. Using postcolonial, postmodern, and critical race feminist theories as a framework of analysis, my thesis investigates the theories and works utilized by feminists in Brazil.

This thesis demonstrates that, far from being passive actors in the 'modernisation' of the country, women created alternative spaces from which to voice their views and their demands.Â  Thus, in order to understand the importance and potential of the 'public sphere' in relation to the early Meiji period, I have used as my theoretical background the works of those female scholars who have developed JÃ¼rgen Habermas' theories to define women' s entrance into, and formation of, the public sphere.Â  I looked at the new professions opened to Japanese women, such as teaching and medicine, at the new public spaces in which they could be found, such as girls' schools and women's groups, and at the ways in which they established links with Western women and learned more about their movements and struggles. My thesis shows how the early Meiji years can be described as the period in which feminism became thinkable.Â  Only a few women were able to formulate thoroughly feminist theories in their writings or take an active part in pursuing their demands.Â  Nevertheless, and for the first time in Japanese history, they could start voicing thoughts in public settings by asking for more public space and participation in society while supporting the nationalistic ideology of educated mothers and wives.",1770028112,,Dissertations & Theses," Patessio, MaraPatessioMaraPatessio, Mara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3969650951 , 44980541 , 101309 , U198417 , U198417", Dissertation/Thesis,2004,, English, English,,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770028112?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIU198417 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+and+the+public+sphere+in+the+early+meiji+period&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patessio%2C+Mara&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.179165799,0.970884662,789,Left,feminism,Church Women United ror peace and equality,Building bridges: Church women united and social reform work across the mid-twentieth century,"Church Women United incorporated in December 1941 as an interdenominational and interracial movement of liberal Protestant women committed to social reform. The one hundred organizers represented ten million Protestant women across the United States. They organized with the express purposes of helping to bring peace on Earth and to develop total equality within all humanity. Church Women United was the bridge between the First and Second Wave of Feminism and the bridge between the Social Gospel and Social Justice Movements. Additionally they connected laterally with numerous social and religious groups across American society. As such, they exemplify the continuity and matrix of reform in American history. Because they worked to promote international peace, develop positive race relations, and advance womenâ€™s rights, their campaigns give us a model for how to rectify the social problems of today. These women used communal prayer, politics, education, and hands-on labor to promote their ideas. They originated in collective prayer and continued this tool, but they added letter writing campaigns, public education forums, and lobbying politicians at all levels including the president to advance their goals. They held massive campaigns to collect needed items for war-torn countries and natural disaster areas as well as acting as counselors to the needy. They raised public awareness of issues facing migrant laborers, inner-city residents, Native Americans, Japanese internment detainees, and then worked hard to ameliorate the worst of these problems. They promoted literacy around the world, as well as new agricultural techniques to address human conditions that were known to lead to political and social unrest. This dissertation covers the mid-twentieth century while being predominately focused on the years 1941-1968. This study is built upon multiple archives across the United States and oral histories of movement leaders. It is one of the first interdenominational studies focused on the work of women in social reform work.

However, little has been said in the scholarship on the social and political significance of these encounters. Instead, this study centers on the different and connected ways in which intimacy shaped the North American West in the early twentieth century. As such, this work makes central and transparent the connections between the expansion of white womenâ€™s political and economic rights and efforts to exclude the Chinese in British Columbia and California. Thus, this study asks: How were changes in the status of white women and shifting notions of domesticity related to debates about Chinese labor and migration? Conversely, to what extent was the anti-Oriental movement and its calls for exclusionary measures informed and shaped by debates about gender roles? Last, how might a transnational analysis of these intersecting debates deepen our understanding of how such controversies shaped Vancouver and San Francisco as frontiers and gateways for Chinese labor migration and white settlement? If both Western Canada and the United States were primary sites for Asian labor migration and white settlement, did intimacy and affective labor play out differently in these two contexts? By using primary source documents to analyze two murder cases involving Chinese servants and two legislative efforts regarding affective labor in the distinct but connected contexts of Western Canada and the United States, this study shows how white women and Chinese men working together in intimate settings became increasingly scrutinized and subject to rampant social commentary and governmental intervention as racial, sexual, and class tensions flared.",1730862918,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Jason UlimKimUlimJasonKim, Jason Ulim", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858568921 , 100044522 , 66569 , 9781339215990 , 3733324 , 3733324", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1730862918?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , History , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Asians in canada , Asians in united states , Canada , Domesticity , Intersectionality , Intimacy , White womanhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Perils+of+Home%3A+Race%2C+Gender%2C+and+Labor+on+the+Pacific+Frontier&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Jason+Ulim&amp;isbn=9781339215990&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.849148046,0.962764488,1518,Left,feminism,Canadian development agency and gender-focused INGOs in Africa,Agents of change: An analysis of gender planning for development in Africa at the Canadian International Development Agency,"The thesis examines how the social construction of African women in development discourse transformed from the 1970s to the 2000s, focusing in particular on the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). From the 1970s to the 1990s representations of African women were based on womenâ€™s economic potential. The mainstreaming of gender in the 1990s resulted in women being represented as agents of change. This approach gave women an opportunity to play roles in decision-making but led to policies that failed to challenge the established institutions. The emphasis on women as agents of change opened doors to some African women but with implications for the womenâ€™s movement. Only some middle-class women appear to benefit but their gains have been marginal in comparison to the gender inequalities that persist.

An historical method was used to identify the four professional nursing organizations' opinions, actions, and intentions relative to their positions on women suffrage. The timeframe for this study was 1893 through 1920. The primary and secondary sources that were used were professional journals; published and unpublished proceedings of each of the four professional nursing organizations; nursing and suffrage archival collections; and historiographies of nursing, women, and the suffrage movement. The four organizations were: The National League of Nursing Education (formerly the Society of Superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses), The American Nurses' Association (The Nurses' Associated Alumnae), The National Organization of Colored Graduate Nurses and the National Association of Public Health Nursing. Findings indicated that among the four national nursing organizations, organizational endorsement of women suffrage was voted on seven different times. Six votes represented the membership of the National League of Nursing Education and the American Nurses' Association. The additional seventh vote was a report of the international organization's vote. Only two of those seven votes resulted in opposition of organizational support of suffrage. Nursing organizations, instead of being conservative were progressive. They sought to change the social system by advocating women's suffrage, education, and practice. To explain why nursing's ties with women history has been incompletely portrayed and often omitted from some historiographies of women, may lie in an underlying prejudice towards nursing and its role by society.

I argue that elite tracksters, a marginalized subset among women and athletes alike, used existing social networks and movements to advocate both cultural acceptance and political advances for women. My research reveals that women athletes in a broad range of rolesâ€”as undergraduates at black southern colleges, members of urban ethnic and religious track teams, civil rights activists, and international representatives of Cold War democracyâ€”emphasized their femininity and skill to counter Americans' belief that female competitors transgressed acceptable social mores. Olympic athletes positioned themselves as ""foxes, not oxes"" even as they prioritized sport, gradually expanding Americans' understanding of gender roles. As U.S. State Department goodwill ambassadors, they engaged in cultural diplomacy. After Title IX codified sex equality in education, athletes weathered a demographic realignment in women's track and allied with mainstream feminists to advocate women's professional sport. While neither U.S. historians nor gender specialists have fully addressed these alternative forms of activism, the close examination of women athletes' social and political advocacy reveals new insights into women's rights efforts outside mainstream feminist ""waves"" and the role of gender in segregated education, urban community networks, and Cold War cultural diplomacy. This project connects U.S. political history, gender studies, education, and international relations, illuminating new facets of each. Uncovering a diverse network of women athletes, Racing to Win reveals the benefit of tracing interracial, ethnic, and religious connections in women's political history in alternative cultural channels like sport. Black women have served as models of American femininity in very few contexts. My research reveals that as athletes, they set the standard for how women should present themselves as national representatives at home and abroad after 1928. This dissertation explores alliances and relationships historians have overlooked to show how women's sport, a subject seemingly peripheral to historical analysis of national political culture and society, illuminates new insights about these central forces.",1033072212,,Dissertations & Theses," Blaschke, Anne MarcelleBlaschkeMarcelleAnneBlaschke, Anne Marcelle", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2733907901 , 65447481 , 66569 , 9781267520708 , 3520300 , 3520300", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1033072212?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Cultural diplomacy , Gender , Political culture , Race , Sport , Track and field , Women athletes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Racing+to+win%3A+Women+track+and+field+athletes+in+American+political+culture%2C+1928%E2%80%931978&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blaschke%2C+Anne+Marcelle&amp;isbn=9781267520708&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.475633811,0.956943766,698,Left,feminism,Chuukese women's reproduction ,The Reproductive Lives of Chuukese Women: Transnationalism in Guam and Chuuk,"Chuuk, one state of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), experiences significant transnational migration to the United States (U.S.), particularly to the Territory of Guam. This migration is facilitated by the Compact of Free Association (COFA), an agreement with several Micronesian countries previously under U.S. administration that allows for free movement of their citizens into the U.S. Although part of Micronesia, Guam's colonized residents resist an identity connected to rest of Micronesia. With very poor health outcomes, the Chuukese represent a political and social body of bodies that bring sickness, babies and increased costs to the Guam government without adequate compensation by their colonizer sanctioning the migration. In order to better understand why Chuukese women suffer disproportionately poor reproductive health outcomes as compared to the rest of Guam's residents, this multi-sited dissertation examines how Chuukese women's reproduction is constructed and conceptualized by women, their families, and their ""home"" and ""host"" communities, and how these meanings are mediated by transnational migrant experiences between Chuuk and Guam. Using a critical interpretive framework, this study utilized participant observation in the clinics and communities, interviews with health care workers, and in-depth life history interviews with fifteen Chuukese women. This dissertation situates Chuukese women's reproduction in the context of transnational migration through an analysis of social, economic and political processes, health and social services policies and practices, postcolonial migration and sociocultural meanings of reproduction for Chuukese women in both Chuuk and Guam.",1562947242,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Sarah A.SmithA.SarahSmith, Sarah A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3435836641 , 87737982 , 66569 , 9781321075403 , 3629977 , 3629977", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562947242?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0573 Public health , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Public health , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Applied medical anthropology , Gender and migration , Micronesia , Sexual and reproductive health",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Reproductive+Lives+of+Chuukese+Women%3A+Transnationalism+in+Guam+and+Chuuk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Sarah+A.&amp;isbn=9781321075403&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.928705555,0.955194248,313,Left,feminism,female education in India,Gender equality in education: india's responses to international agendas,"Despite the high profile of gender equality, little research has been conducted on the interaction between current international and national strategies in relation to female education.Ã‚Â  The case of female education is particularly interesting, as there is little consensus on the meaning of Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½gender equalityÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ in education and why it is important.Ã‚Â  The thesis explores these different conceptualisations and offers an historical perspective on the development of this global agenda since the mid-twentieth century whilst addressing such questions as: how are such global agendas interpreted at national level and what factors are influential in these processes?

It analyzes and reassesses the impact of migration to New York on Russian Jewish and Italian women's lives. The principal organizing question is whether and to what extent migration diminished, intensified, and/or transformed the nature of women's subordination. The first chapter is a critical review of the main theoretical approaches to women's international migrations. The outline of an alternative interpretive framework that places the interconnected and global processes of gender, race/ethnicity/nationality, and class transformation at the center of the dynamics of women's migration experiences is developed. The specific political, economic, and social changes in the world-system that both prompted women's departures from Russia and Italy and shaped their modes of incorporation in the United States is the subject of chapters two and three. In chapters four and five I examine the varying nature of immigrant women's receptions in the U.S. by political and economic institutions, by the dominant population, by kin, and by pre-existing co-ethnic communities, all of which played a significant role in differentiating women's experiences from one another. Married women and mothers, both Italian and Russian Jewish, experienced migration to the U.S. as relatively disempowering in most dimensions of their lives. Young single women, on the other hand, experienced increased autonomy following migration. The single most important factor affecting women's experience of migration, however, was the nature of their reception by a pre-existing co-ethnic community. The extent to which these communities were differently organized to protect women against the effects of racial nativism, as well as gender and class bias, was largely a consequence of world-systemic processes which had shaped transnational population movements.",304072015,,Dissertations & Theses," Kasaba, Kathie FriedmanKasabaFriedmanKathieKasaba, Kathie Friedman", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 745936051 , 19135491 , 66569 , 9217703 , 9217703", Dissertation/Thesis,1992,, English, English,,1992,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304072015?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0938 Demographics"," 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0938 Demographics"," 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0938 Demographics",," 0453 Womens studies , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0938 Demographics"," Womens studies , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Demographics"," Social sciences , Italians , Jewish , women immigrants",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22To+become+a+person%22%3A+Immigrant+women%27s+experiences+of+gender%2C+ethnicity%2C+and+work%2C+New+York%2C+1870-1924&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kasaba%2C+Kathie+Friedman&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.6057255,0.952376333,2481,Left,feminism,women's international organizations ,Lobbying the League: women's international organizations and the League of Nations.,"This thesis is an account of women's international work at the League of Nations. While feminists' shift from the national to the international arena has been noted in studies on the inter-war women's movement, most often it has been interpreted as a reflection of the heightened salience of peace work in the aftermath of the First World War. This is an important observation but it overlooks the fact that women's activities at the League embraced the full spectrum of feminist causes: social reform, women's rights and peace. This thesis gives prominence to inter-war feminist activity played against the backdrop of institutional developments at the League which encouraged women to believe their goals could be advanced under its auspices. One of the major goals of the Women's International Organizations was to establish a political role for women in international affairs. The first chapter describes the efforts of women's organizations to secure the representation of women in the League of Nations. Many recently enfranchised women in Europe and North America identified the League as an institution toward which they should direct their newly won political influence. This is assessed in the context of ideas that emerged in the aftermath of the First World War about the transformation of the international sphere through the infusion of female values. The second, third and fourth chapters present a profile of the women's networks operating in and around the League. The study reveals a high level of interaction between the Women's International Organizations and women in official positions at the League. Chapter 2 examines the aims of the Women's International Organizations and exposes tensions between social feminist and equal rights feminist organizations that led to a struggle for influence at the League. The third and fourth chapters assess the impact of gender-stereotyping on patterns of appointments to the League. However much appointments to Assembly delegations and League advisory committees should have carried with them national allegiances, women delegates were often seen to represent women and this both positively and negatively affected women's participation. The remaining chapters assess women's impact on the development of League activities with particular attention to the implications of the idea that women as women had a special contribution to make at the international level.",301504437,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, C.MillerC.Miller, C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756312561 , 44410581 , 101309 , U042665 , U042665", Dissertation/Thesis,1992,, English, English,,1992,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1992,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301504437?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU042665 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lobbying+the+League%3A++women%27s+international+organizations+and+the+League+of+Nations.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1992-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.601592598,0.945172297,2782,Left,feminism,women's health movement,The women's health movement and the International Conference on Population and Development (BL),"Using the case study of the United Nations (UN) International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), this thesis investigates the degree to which there may have been a shift from the paradigm of state centric international relations to that of 'global politics and global civil society' is central to the disciplines of International Relations (IR) and International Political Economy (IPE). The primary question asked is why the states, international organisations and non-state actors which were involved in the ICPD process, reached such a high level of agreement on the issues of reproductive health, reproductive rights and women's empowerment. The main hypothesis is that the women's health movement (a global social movement), had a significant influence upon the ICPD process and upon the major actors involved in it (the United States, United Nations and the Holy See.). Using three indicators of significance - language, involvement in the decision-making process and implementation - it is shown that the women's health movement was the single most significant influence upon the Cairo policy of the United States and United Nations. In the case of the Holy See, the women's health movement had a lesser significance, but was still a catalyst of Holy See policy for Cairo. By arguing that the women's health movement is a global social movement and examining its influence upon the ICPD, the thesis raises important theoretical issues. First, it is argued that the findings strengthen the theoretical argument within IR/IPE for the existence and importance of global social movements. Second, I argue that the women's' health movement's significant influence is representative of the formation of an incipient 'global politics' and 'global civil society'. However, the thesis indicates that these alternative socio-political forms have not yet replaced the state centric paradigm of international relations, but exist along side it. Nor does the emergence of an incipient 'global politics' and 'global civil society' signal the emergence of radical transnational/global democracy. Instead, what currently exists is a mixture of liberal-internationalist and radical democratic forms.",301561328,,Dissertations & Theses," Dodgson, R.P.DodgsonR.P.Dodgson, R.P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757877821 , 44716911 , 101309 , U109499 , U109499", Dissertation/Thesis,1999,, English, English,,1999,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301561328?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," (UMI)AAIU109499 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+women%27s+health+movement+and+the+International+Conference+on+Population+and+Development+%28BL%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dodgson%2C+R.P.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.453187331,0.939917119,2474,Left,feminism,the Swedish hemslojd movement,In good taste and wholesome for society: On Handarbetets Vanner and the Swedish hemslojd movement,"Foreningen Handarbetets Vanner, HV was founded in 1874 by 20 women of aristocratic and upper middle-class birth to promote Swedish textile handcrafts in the home. The Swedish hemslojd movement consists of some 50 handicraft associations developed during the 20th century to promote handicrafts. Activities, in which women have been predominant, include production in workshops and in the home, sale of patterns, materials and handcraft products, and consultancy work. Recently these associations have become less profitable; several shops have had to give up. The aim of this thesis is to analyse, describe and explain the background to these difficulties and conflicts. HV is described against a background of economic and political interest in supporting cottage/rural industries in the predominantly agrarian Swedish society c. 1870. The thesis deals with this by using reports and analyses of contemporary debates and resolutions passed in the Swedish Parliament. HV linked the current international renewal of design and home-furnishings with economic and political objectives, and also became part of the women's emancipation movement. They employed women designers, weavers, etc. HV's early production concentrated on the home and also gave women at home the chance to make their own textile furnishings. HV also organised the training of weaving teachers. Foreningen for Svensk Hemslojd was started in Stockholm in 1899 to improve the products of the rural/cottage industries and make marketing easier. Handicraft associations' activity went into improving craft products by renewal based on traditional Swedish folk designs. They followed the ideas of HV. ""Hemslojd"" is regarded by authorities as an economic and political instrument, while those actually involved look to its concrete results and products. By using the theories of Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo et al. about separate male and female spheres and patterns of socialisation and Ulrike Prokop's theory about the life patterns of women, the author is able to explain this dichotomy. By using cultural analysis, the author shows how these activities are dominated by middle-class values. An examination is made of the success of HV and the handicraft associations with a growing middle class during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Pierre Bourdieu's model is used, showing how lifestyles and taste relate to each other and to the social space where different groups in society act out their lives. The circumstances uncovered by this thesis, then, have contributed to the present difficulties and dilemmas within the Swedish handicraft association movement.",303960194,,Dissertations & Theses," Danielson, Sofia Ingalill DagmarDanielsonIngalill DagmarSofiaDanielson, Sofia Ingalill Dagmar", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 743835941 , 30602691 , 66569 , 9789171083173 , 9171083170 , C237471 , C237471", Dissertation/Thesis,1991," 9789171083173 , 9171083170", Swedish, Swedish,,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303960194?accountid=14496, 0453 Womens studies, 0453 Womens studies, 0453 Womens studies,, 0453 Womens studies, Womens studies," Social sciences , handicrafts , women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+good+taste+and+wholesome+for+society%3A+On+Handarbetets+Vanner+and+the+Swedish+hemslojd+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Danielson%2C+Sofia+Ingalill+Dagmar&amp;isbn=9789171083173&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.230396333,0.938463763,2849,Left,feminism,women's organisations and the Internet in Ireland ,"Small media, big network: alternative media and social movements on the Internet.","This thesis explores alternative media on the Internet by drawing on a range of theoretical literatures - particularly in the areas of the public sphere, social movements and globalisation. Parallel to this theoretical exploration, a significant body of published research is reviewed on Internet use by social movements and groups in global, national, and local contexts. From this review and analysis, an original conceptual framework for analysing alternative media on the Internet is developed. A range of methodological approaches were designed to empirically develop the research issues. Empirical research on women's organisations and the Internet in Ireland was conducted over a four-year period. The original work is significant because there have been few previous attempts to systematically devise an operational framework for research on alternative media. The framework contains seven elements. The first three are characteristics of alternative media forms or processes on the Internet - the participants, the production process and the content. The last four elements concern the wider social, political and cultural context of the media activity. The framework categorises the main areas of concern to researchers of alternative media on the Internet. Research questions are intended to develop a full scope of structural, social political and cultural factors involved in the production and use of alternative media forms and processes on the Internet and to resist superficial interpretations.

Despite their enfranchisement, women did not possess power within critical deliberative and administrative bodies of domestic and international politics. As a result, post-suffrage women's organizations, such as the League of Women Voters (LWV) and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), relied on collective rhetorical practices to pressure for reform even after women were formally admitted to electoral politics. In this study, I present a detailed analysis of the rhetorical practices the LWV and the WILPF used to train American women as political rhetors and to challenge the rhetorical conventions of male-dominated political discourse in the decade after suffrage. To accomplish this analysis, my project combines extensive archival study with the critical perspectives of feminist historiography in composition and rhetoric. Additionally, I use the work of Kenneth Burke and Mikhail Bakhtin to understand how the LWV and the WILPF established a political ethos for women as they entered the hostile environments of domestic and international politics. Because the study of historical discourses requires an exploration of the contexts that produced them, my project also discusses the influence of the early twentieth-century progressive education movement on these organizations, specifically through their links to prominent educational theorists John Dewey and Jane Addams. Finally, I consider how the rhetorical practices of these two organizations might inform present-day instruction in composition and rhetoric by suggesting more extensive study of the persistent, cumulative persuasive practices that subordinate groups use to cultivate broader receptivity to innovative arguments for social and political change.",304719656,,Dissertations & Theses," Sharer, Wendy BethSharerBethWendySharer, Wendy Beth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725900191 , 27555881 , 66569 , 9780493322315 , 0493322310 , 3020532 , 3020532", Dissertation/Thesis,2001," 9780493322315 , 0493322310", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304719656?accountid=14496," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history",," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0516 Adult education , 0516 Continuing education , 0453 Womens studies , 0337 American history"," Rhetoric , Composition , Adult education , Continuing education , Womens studies , American history"," Social sciences , Education , Language, literature and linguistics , Activism , Reform , Rhetoric , Women's organizations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rhetoric%2C+reform%2C+and+political+activism+in+United+States+women%27s+organizations%2C+1920--1930&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sharer%2C+Wendy+Beth&amp;isbn=9780493322315&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.687851164,0.923692577,1881,Left,feminism,women's movements in South Korea,"Remapping women's movements, rethinking feminist politics in South Korea (1980s-1990s): links and tensions between the local, the national, and the global.","This research aims to reconstruct feminist politics by exploring the exclusion of local women's experiences within women's movements, which are constructed within the wider national and global context, and by considering how to include them within the feminist politics in South Korea (hereafter Korea). It is based on the case study of women's organisations in Taejon city using feminist oral history interviews, focusing on the transitional period including the authoritarian period (the 1980s) and the democratisation era (the 1990s). The main concerns of this research are: In what ways and contexts are local women's experiences excluded from Korean feminist politics and how to include them. This thesis is a critique as well as a reconstruction. While criticising an exclusive feminist politics based on dichotomous discourse, it suggests possible ways to include local women's experiences within the feminist politics. The inclusion of local women's experiences considers three themes based on feminist citizenship theory: the politicisation of the personal, the politicisation of the local, and the creation of inclusive/transversal politics. Firstly, it explores Korean feminist dichotomous discourse between the new progressive feminist activism and the old conservative non-feminist activism. Current feminist discourse caught in this dichotomy functions to exclude local women's experiences and their activism framed largely under the influence of conservative non-feminist activism. Testimonies of local women disprove this feminist dichotomy and blur the fixed boundaries between feminist and non-feminist groups. Secondly, this thesis examines the social context of local women's exclusion, situating their experiences within the context of development policy at national and global levels. Local women's voices demonstrate that the shifting boundaries between different women's groups are constructed within the context of development policy at both of these levels.",301642703,,Dissertations & Theses," Hur, S.HurS.Hur, S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760555831 , 45086391 , 101309 , U199978 , U199978", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301642703?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN091970 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Remapping+women%27s+movements%2C+rethinking+feminist+politics+in+South+++Korea+%281980s-1990s%29%3A+links+and+tensions+between+the+local%2C+the+national%2C+and+the+global.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hur%2C+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.906039995,0.913618349,1320,Left,feminism,Resistance and gender in Uruguayan and U.S. revolutionary movements,"Imagining the Tupamaros: Resistance and gender in Uruguayan and U.S. revolutionary movements, 1960sâ€“1980s","Using sources located in archives and special collections in Argentina, Uruguay and the United States, this dissertation challenges long held assumptions about the Uruguayan Tupamaros. I employ the methodologies of social and cultural history and feminist scholarship to examine the relationship between state repression and revolutionary resistance, the transnational connections between the Uruguayan Tupamaros and leftist groups in the US as well as issues of gender and sexuality within radical movements. I argue that the Tupamaros engaged in an active discussion with US-based revolutionaries. Focusing on the perspective of Latin Americans during the Cold War, this dissertation examines what the Uruguayan left thought about US politics and culture. I uncover that the Uruguayan left saw the US as two Americas. They criticized the US government but allied with many of its people. This occurred both in the imagination of Uruguayans and in real life connections forged between leftists. While scholars have primarily explored Cubaâ€™s influence on the North American left, I focus on the ways in which the Uruguayan left (particularly the Tupamaros) shaped the activism of US leftists. This study also adds to the discussion of gender and sexuality in Latin America as I investigate whether or not gender reorganization represented a true political goal of the Tupamaros or if their inclusion of women primarily constituted revolutionary rhetoric. While most of the Uruguayan left focused on motherhood as inspiring womenâ€™s politics, the Tupamaros disdained traditional constructions of femininity for female combatants. Therefore, although at times problematic, the Tupamaros offered women a new avenue for political participation.",849734451,,Dissertations & Theses," Churchill, Lindsey BlakeChurchillBlakeLindseyChurchill, Lindsey Blake", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2260691671 , 58057171 , 66569 , 9781124456966 , 3442110 , 3442110", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,9.78E+12, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/849734451?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies"," Latin American history , International Relations , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Feminism , Gender , Left , Revolution , Tupamaros , United States , Uruguay",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+the+Tupamaros%3A+Resistance+and+gender+in+Uruguayan+and+U.S.+revolutionary+movements%2C+1960s%E2%80%931980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Churchill%2C+Lindsey+Blake&amp;isbn=9781124456966&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.029535066,0.905959665,2589,Left,feminism,International Sex Reform movement,"Devices and desires: Constructing the intrauterine device, 1908-1988","By 1908 a new, doctor inserted, scientific contraceptive had gained some acceptance in areas of Germany. This technology became known as the intrauterine contraceptive device. By 1930 it enjoyed limited international success through its alliance with the International Sex Reform movement. The devices became linked with campaigns to take the suffrage struggle into the private sphere, a technological means for achieving modernity for women. In the 1960s the Population Council remade this contraceptive system as a mass produced global network of population control. Then in the 1970s the Dalkon Shield became synonymous with corporate misconduct. The women's health movement accused intrauterine device protagonists of exploiting women's inequality to produce a dangerous technology that was destroying women's health. Whilst copper intrauterine devices escaped the tarnish of the Dalkon Shield, the litigation over the Copper-7 that resulted in a punitive damages finding against Searle in 1988, resulted in a serious decline in further research into intrauterine devices. This thesis explores the production processes through which the discovery, success, development and failure of intrauterine devices were constructed. My work is a case study located at the intersection of feminist critiques of science and technology, and constructivist sociology of science. I investigate gendered outcomes of the heterogeneous negotiations that stabilise intrauterine device technologies, paying attention to the effects generated by the active participation of social movements in such negotiations. This study is informed by a modified actor network framework (Latour and Callon), presenting the social, identity, the technical, the natural and the boundary between them as network effects. I focus on the translations of human and non-human actants constitutive of intrauterine device contraceptives as socio-technical networks, whether they occur in courts or in laboratories. I examine how authority is distributed to particular research sites, and how we learn to trust in numbers as calculations of risks and benefits. I suggest that such a form of story-telling about technologies opens novel possibilities for solidarity formation and collective engagement with socio-technical networks, including issues of regulation and policy formation.",304224756,,Dissertations & Theses," Dugdale, Ann MarieDugdaleMarieAnnDugdale, Ann Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739298641 , 30107041 , 66569 , 0597399 , 0597399", Dissertation/Thesis,1995,, English, English,,1995,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1995,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304224756?accountid=14496," 0585 Science history , 0453 Womens studies , 0380 Obstetrics , 0380 Gynecology"," 0585 Science history , 0453 Womens studies , 0380 Obstetrics , 0380 Gynecology"," 0585 Science history , 0453 Womens studies , 0380 Obstetrics , 0380 Gynecology",," 0585 Science history , 0453 Womens studies , 0380 Obstetrics , 0380 Gynecology"," Science history , Womens studies , Obstetrics , Gynecology"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , reproductive choice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Devices+and+desires%3A+Constructing+the+intrauterine+device%2C+1908-1988&amp;issn=&amp;date=1995-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dugdale%2C+Ann+Marie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.488279178,0.941568555,2665,Mixed,feminism,Conservative and progressive women's movements in Chile,"In the name of the public and the private: Conservative and progressive women's movements in Chile, 1970-1996","Why do women organize separately from men in the context of political opposition? What unique contributions do women make to the politics of opposition and regime change? This study addresses these questions from the perspective of two diametrically-opposed women's movements in Chile: first, the women who mobilized to oust President Salvador Allende in the early 1970s and second, the women who mobilized against the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet in the late 1970s and 1980s. I compare these two movements in terms of their emergence, evolution and political outcomes. I find that, despite important differences between them, in both cases women sought to unite the myriad factions within the opposition, both sought to incorporate women's concerns onto the opposition agenda and both formed the basis for sweeping changes in policies toward women in the regimes that ensued. This study challenges basic assumptions within the fields of women in politics, social movements and political institutions. First, by incorporating conservative women into the study of women's movements, this study questions feminist theoretical conceptions of the state, particularly regarding the dichotomy between public and private spheres. Second, I show that the way that social movement actors frame their demands is an important political resource. Finally, I maintain that the outcomes of these movements is largely a function of decisions made by political actors at the national level (such as legislatures, political parties and governments) and the international level (such as the United Nations).",304354133,,Dissertations & Theses," Baldez, LisaBaldezLisaBaldez, Lisa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739703841 , 26969881 , 66569 , 9780591316629 , 0591316625 , 9722826 , 9722826", Dissertation/Thesis,1997," 9780591316629 , 0591316625", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304354133?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0336 Latin American history",," 0615 Political science , 0453 Womens studies , 0336 Latin American history"," Political science , Womens studies , Latin American history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+the+name+of+the+public+and+the+private%3A+Conservative+and+progressive+women%27s+movements+in+Chile%2C+1970-1996&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baldez%2C+Lisa&amp;isbn=9780591316629&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.915256806,0.945228238,815,Unknown,feminism,the British Girl Guide Movement,Gendered patriots and post-revolutionary ladies: Girl guiding and twentieth century Mexican girlhood,"Through the lens of the GuÃ­as de MÃ©xico (Girl Guides of Mexico), Gendered Patriots and Postrevolutionary Ladies examines Girl Guide efforts to advance international cooperation and peace by promoting international friendship among the worldâ€™s youth between 1919 and 1980. From its birth as a branch of the British Girl Guide Movement, Mexican Guides participated in the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scoutâ€™s (WAGGGS) international conferences, encampments, and global initiatives. During the first half of the twentieth century Western European and United States members established WAGGGS global agenda for social reform and the advancement of women and youth. At the same time Mexican women experienced the radical social and political transformations taking place in post-revolutionary Mexico, and evaluated the Guide Movementâ€™s significance to their gender and culture. This dissertation serves as a case study to explore United States and British cultural imperialism across the twentieth century, and the ways in which Mexican women challenged imperialist assumptions while at the same time adapting and acculturating the fundamental principles of WAGGGS. The postrevolutionary reconstruction of gender in Mexico took place alongside first and second wave internationalist feminist movements through which womenâ€™s roles were contested and redefined. WAGGGS members viewed their association as feminist and egalitarian, and aimed to advance womenâ€™s rights and interests internationally. However, western leaders viewed themselves as guides who would teach their Latin American counterparts how to educate young women and girls, and saw United States and western European suffragist and feminist movements as a template for womenâ€™s progress abroad. Adolescence and womanhood were politicized, debated, and challenged in Mexico and internationally across the twentieth century. This study demonstrates how ordinary women who were Girl Guide members appropriated, challenged, and transformed global, national and local interpretations of womenâ€™s rights, roles, and biological and cultural representations, while at the same time supporting maternalist rhetoric with regards to their social position in society.",1780988691,,Dissertations & Theses," Kelly, MaryannKellyMaryannKelly, Maryann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4022311641 , 103962102 , 66569 , 9781339001289 , 3719595 , 3719595", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780988691?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , European history , Latin American history , Womens studies , Political science , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Gendered patriots , Mexican girlhood , Post-revolutionary ladies , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendered+patriots+and+post-revolutionary+ladies%3A+Girl+guiding+and+twentieth+century+Mexican+girlhood&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kelly%2C+Maryann&amp;isbn=9781339001289&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.695317553,0.990650487,1590,Left,health,bolivian revolution,"Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952â€“1964","This dissertation examines the extension of public health programs into the countryside following the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution, which put the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Movement, MNR) into power. Historical studies of the Bolivian Revolution have focused on its political and economic agenda, mainly agrarian reform, nationalization of the mining industry, and granting of universal suffrage to formerly disenfranchised populations. However, public health was as important to the revolutionary government's plan for political, economic, and cultural consolidation as these well-explored topics. Though public health programs focused on maternal and infant health, vaccinations, and disease control projects, I argue they were designed to consolidate and institutionalize the revolution, boost a faltering economy, and foster revolutionary nationalism. Public health provides a lens for a cultural analysis of the MNR's political, economic, and social agenda and reveals the gender and racial dynamics of the revolutionary state formation process. Health campaigns in Bolivia in the 1950s and 1960s were linked to hierarchies of gender, race, and citizenship; the MNR thought public health programs would eradicate a perceived impediment to Bolivia's progress by transforming rural living conditions, linking indigenous communities to the national government, and producing a healthy citizenry and workforce. Local, national, and international levels of analysis provide a multifaceted understanding of the negotiation of health, citizenship, and identity during the revolutionary period and show that health campaigns were created and contested in multiple political and cultural arenas. Internationally, the MNR relied on funding and personnel from the United States and incorporated international public health rhetoric into its own campaigns. At the national level, government officials and doctors conjoined revolutionary rhetoric and public health programs. Local communities articulated their own version of this rhetoric to demand the government fulfill its revolutionary promises by providing health services. Therefore, public health provides a framework for examining social relations, identity formation, and the contestation of power in modern Bolivia.",1448528990,,Dissertations & Theses," Pacino, Nicole LohmanPacinoLohmanNicolePacino, Nicole Lohman", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3117907921 , 78959542 , 66569 , 9781303426551 , 3596219 , 3596219", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448528990?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0573 Public health , 0585 Science history"," Latin American history , Latin American Studies , Public health , Science history"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Bolivia , Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario , Public health , Revolution",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Prescription+for+a+Nation%3A+Public+Health+in+Post-Revolutionary+Bolivia%2C+1952%E2%80%931964&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pacino%2C+Nicole+Lohman&amp;isbn=9781303426551&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.701820149,0.970147377,2290,Left,health,chi-related exercise in Taiwan,New way of healing: experienced counsellors' perceptions of the influence of châ€™i-related exercises on counselling practice in taiwan,"This study examines how Taiwanese senior counsellors with substantial experience of châ€™i-related exercise (CRE) perceived the influence of their regular CRE on their counselling practice.

There are growing numbers of counselling professionals involved in regular CRE in recent years. Studies examining the effects of CRE indicate the benefits of CRE on practitioners' global health and personal growth. However, no previous study has investigated the influence of the long-term regular use of CRE on counsellorsâ€Ÿ self-care and counselling practice. The narrative research design for this study was developed from a post-structural theoretical perspective located in the domain of social constructivism. The data were co-constructed between the researcher and 12 senior Taiwanese counsellors with substantial CRE experience using a semi-structured in-depth interview approach. Interview data were analysed using the structure-based approach developed by William Labov in the field of socio-linguistics. The study reveals an overall benefit of regular involvement in CRE for practitioners' global wellbeing and personal growth counsellor' self-care. The research findings also reveals the potential of châ€™i to be used as a way of expressing health and illness and a way of understanding in therapy and CRE to be lived out in therapy as an embodiment. I argue that collectively the narratives, as a whole, give evidence of an increasing integratin of the ideas and practices of châ€™i into counselling practice in contemporary Taiwan. This might even make up a new form of integrated and culturally appropriate practice, what I term ""a new way of healing."" These are therapeutic practices which value the potential of CRE for counsellor's self-care and personal growth; recognize the integral whole of the human person; promote conscious use of the knowledge and experience of châ€™i and CRE in therapy as an important aspect of the therapeutic use of self. Implications for practice such as the potential of CRE to be introduced into counsellor training programmes for counsellors' preparation or ongoing education are provided. Recommendations for future research such as the development of a new healing modality based on the research findings are offered.",1687701207,,Dissertations & Theses," Liou, Chin-PingLiouChin-PingLiou, Chin-Ping", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713047471 , 96800602 , 101309 , U640007 , U640007 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9496", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687701207?accountid=14496," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," Alternative Medicine , Counseling Psychology"," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9496 , (UMI)AAIU640007 , Psychology , Health and environmental sciences , China",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+way+of+healing%3A+experienced+counsellors%27+perceptions+of+the+influence+of+ch%E2%80%99i-related+exercises+on+counselling+practice+in+taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liou%2C+Chin-Ping&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.774358872,0.943896387,2766,Left,health,National and global movements toward interdependence,How interdependence in cultures promotes well-being,"The main thesis of this study is that cultures of interdependence promote psychological well-being, in contrast to cultures of independence that tend to foster psychological distress. The thesis originated from the author's experiences of well-being while living in Kenya. These experiences are described in Part One. Part Two provides a scholarly development of the argument. Cultures of interdependence, such as agrarian societies, arc composed of social structures that promote and support positive interactions between people; they emphasize the good of the collective. Social institutions in independent cultures, such as urban-industrialized Western societies, support individual autonomy and personal fulfillment; they promote the good of the individual. There is a large body of empirical research that demonstrates that close relationships, social support, and cooperation promote mental and physical well-being. In contrast, loss or absence of close bonds leads to distress. The competition and individualism prevalent in independent cultures impedes the development of positive interpersonal relationships and tends, instead, to foster anxiety, depression, and a variety of social ills. In interdependent societies, family members work together harmoniously and cooperatively toward common goals. Close relations, social support, and cooperation are essential for family survival. Strategies that interdependent societies use to foster positive relationships can be adapted to independent cultures. Recommendations for fostering bonds include giving children important responsibilities within the family so that they learn that their contribution is important and that others depend on them. Cooperation has been shown to not only enhance relationships and psychological well-being, but also achievement School and business settings would profit by making cooperation a priority goal. Interdependent cultures have discovered ways to structure interpersonal relations in ways that enhance well-being. Many of these ways can be adapted to modern independent societies: the implementation of child rearing techniques that promote prosocial behavior and the prizing of people, relationships, and cooperation. Most women and minority ethnic groups already share interdependent attitudes and values; they can help promote such a value shift. National and global movements toward interdependence can enhance the well-being of all.",304478506,,Dissertations & Theses," Resnick, Cecily AnnResnickAnnCecilyResnick, Cecily Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733050681 , 28597281 , 66569 , 9780599141209 , 0599141204 , 9915404 , 9915404", Dissertation/Thesis,1998," 9780599141209 , 0599141204", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304478506?accountid=14496," 0622 Psychotherapy , 0451 Social psychology , 0620 Developmental psychology"," 0622 Psychotherapy , 0451 Social psychology , 0620 Developmental psychology"," 0622 Psychotherapy , 0451 Social psychology , 0620 Developmental psychology",," 0622 Psychotherapy , 0451 Social psychology , 0620 Developmental psychology"," Psychotherapy , Social psychology , Developmental psychology"," Psychology , Cooperation , Interdependence , Social support , Well-being",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=How+interdependence+in+cultures+promotes+well-being&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Resnick%2C+Cecily+Ann&amp;isbn=9780599141209&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.287048991,0.930645315,1357,Left,health,contemporary media movements; HIV eradication,The Role of the Imagined Worlds of Narrative in Social Change in Kenya: Exploring narrative consumption tendencies amongst youth in urban Nairobi and their interaction with fictional texts geared at altering health behaviour,"This research paper in a manifestation of my interest in the mechanisms of imagined worlds of narrative to bring about progressive social change, in the context of global flows of contemporary media movements. I begin with an exploration of the theoretical aspects of narrative and its creation of imagined worlds, specifically those of morality, tradition and the self. All these themes pertain to the reception of the main case study being investigated, a television mini-series shot and broadcast in Kenya called Shuga . Targeted at urban youth in Kenya, the show aimed to inculcate certain conscious health behaviours surrounding the HIV-AIDS disease through fictional narrative. From the results of surveys and interviews with 160 students at two major university institutions in Kenya, I gauge what sort of television programming consumption habits are prevalent amongst this community, as a basis for evaluating the success of Shuga in changing certain attitudes and behaviours. I briefly touch on the specificity of television as a deliverer of narrative, and comment on the predominant affiliation of Kenyan youth with the â€˜global blackâ€™ phenomenon. The narratives in the show, and those of its watchers, form an important component of the ethos of this paper.

Former temple servants, religious functionaries, and courtesans in the medieval to early Colonial period (c. 10 th â€“19 th century), over time the Devadasis have lost their wealthy patrons and attendant socio-religious status. While often equated with commercial sex workers, many Devadasis continue to practice age-old ceremonies and customs. However, many aspects of these sex workers' lives are misunderstood. A combination of qualitative methods was used during this research; mainly participant-observation, interviews (individual, group, life-histories), and workshops with participants were coordinated to ensure their participation in the process and feedback on study results. Among the most important findings is the alternative model of child prostitution that emerged from the data. Contrary to standard portrayals of the young as victims of a degraded trade, Devadasi girls discussed some positive aspects of prostitution, such as their ability to support their families, providing income to participate in peer activities, and becoming an adult. The common assumption about sex workers as sexually detached and incapable of forming important unions was also challenged, as many Devadasis enjoy meaningful sex with their long-term lovers or partners, who are central to the women's socio-emotional and economic well-being. Their response to state-level social reform movements aimed at â€œrescuingâ€ them from prostitution reveals a pragmatic understanding of these campaigns not often considered in the literature, with the women incorporating these programs into their sex work earnings to maximize their position in a demanding economic environment. Similarly, their involvement in the formation of Collective organizations in order to develop a sense of empowerment in their fight against HIV/AIDS reveals the women's ability to mobilize and politicize their demands. The results of this dissertation are relevant to the emerging research on global sex work, especially in relation to the issues of childhood, sexuality, and relationships, and they present new data on the Devadasis about coming of age, changes in the system over time, social reform, and HIV/AIDS.",305088392,,Dissertations & Theses," Orchard, TreenaOrchardTreenaOrchard, Treena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 845713331 , 18452431 , 66569 , 9780612973008 , 061297300X , NQ97300 , NQ97300", Dissertation/Thesis,2004," 9780612973008 , 061297300X", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305088392?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , AIDS , Coming of age , Devadasis , HIV/AIDS , Immune deficiency , India , Karnataka , Sex workers , Social reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+painful+power%3A++Coming+of+age%2C+sexuality+and+relationships%2C%0Asocial+reform%2C+and+HIV%2FAIDS+among+Devadasi+sex+workers+in+rural+Karnataka%2C+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Orchard%2C+Treena&amp;isbn=9780612973008&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.288211047,0.970693536,1305,Left,human rights,human and civil rights in US and South Africa,Forward movement?

Even with the progress made in the United States since the Civil Rights Movement and Apartheid struggle in South Africa, blacks in both countries continue to experience violations of their rights. South Africa's usage of the United States as a model for human rights culture must be reconsidered because the U.S.'s human rights record is tarnished.

Scholars, however, have yet to carefully probe the link between secondary stakeholder legal action and target firm stock market performance. This is puzzling given the sharp rise in NGO-initiated civil lawsuits against corporations in recent years for alleged overseas human rights abuses and environmental misconduct. Furthermore, few studies have considered how such lawsuits impact a target firmâ€™s intangible assets, namely its image and reputation. Structured in the form of three essays, this dissertation examined the antecedents and consequences of secondary stakeholder legal activism in both conceptual and empirical settings. Essay One argued that conventional approaches to understanding political risk fail to account for the reputational risks to multinational enterprises (MNEs) posed by transnational networks of human rights NGOs employing litigation-based strategies. It offered a new framework for understanding this emerging challenge to multinational corporate activity. Essay Two empirically tested the relationship between the filing of human rights-related civil lawsuits and corporate stock market performance using an event study methodology and regression analysis. The statistical analysis performed showed that target firms experience a significant decline in share price upon filing and that both industry and nature of the lawsuit are significantly and negatively related to shareholder wealth. Essay Three drew upon social movement and social identity theories to develop and test a set of hypotheses on how secondary stakeholder groups select their targets for human rights-related civil lawsuits. The results of a logistic regression model offered support for the proposition that MNE targets are chosen based on both interest and identity factors. The results of these essays suggest that legal action initiated by secondary stakeholder groups is a new and salient threat to multinational business and that firms doing business in countries with weak political institutions should factor this into corporate planning and take steps to mitigate their exposure to such risks.",952671767,,Dissertations & Theses," Wernick, David AdamWernickAdamDavidWernick, David Adam", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2620181721 , 64044161 , 66569 , 9781267243362 , 3502128 , 3502128", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,9.78E+12, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/952671767?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management," Management , Studies , Political risk , Multinational corporations"," Social sciences , Legal activism , Multinational enterprises , Nongovernmental organizations , Reputation , Risk , Secondary stakeholders",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Secondary+stakeholders+as+agents+of+influence%3A+Three+essays+on+political+risk%2C+reputation%2C+and+multinational+performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wernick%2C+David+Adam&amp;isbn=9781267243362&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.188024597,0.956911577,481,Left,human rights,violence prevention education program in Mexico,Re-Educating â€œVictimsâ€ and â€œAggressorsâ€ of Violence: Mapping Discourse and Practice in a Mexican Violence Prevention Education Program,"The international human rights movement against gendered violence provides a valuable site for understanding how new categories of meaning emerge and are applied to social practices around the world.

This ethnographic research examines how gender and violence are discussed within a violence prevention education program located in a north central Mexican city. By observing interactions between facilitators and participants, participating in the program's sessions, conducting one-on-one interviews with the program's facilitators, and analyzing the manual used by the prevention education program, I explore how gender and violence are defined in a local setting. The project considers how transnational discourse on human rights and gendered violence has been adapted to become relevant to individuals' lives. This analysis reveals how global human rights discourse does not neatly translate to local settings.

It presents a four-point model for approaching the study of United States human rights policy. The key element in all the cases is bonding social capital, also called affective politics. American policy towards the Soviet Union and Uganda both demonstrate the integration of international, transnational, and domestic politics. Taiwan receives special attention because U.S. Taiwan policy continues to exemplify the integration of international relations, transnational relations, and domestic politics. The Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) represents Taiwanese-Americans who care about promoting democracy on Taiwan and, ultimately, Taiwan's legal status as an independent country. FAPA cultivates and sustains relationships with members of Congress and their staff to create the Taiwan Caucus in the House and Senate, second in influence only to the Israel Caucus, which is cultivated by the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). This study investigates how the Taiwan Independence Movement (TIM) learned, in part from AIPAC, to become politically viable as an ethnic lobby in the 1980s after limited success in the 1960s and 1970s, despite lacking the voting power and financial resources of Jewish-Americans. This study examines how bonding social capital (affective politics) is used to compensate for deficiencies in financial capital and voting power (rational politics), thus creating the political capital that political entrepreneurs use to shape U.S. foreign policy.

A concern of voluntary associations in Great Britain originally, the movement diffused as the associations internationalized and gained the interest of state officials around the world. Those involved developed international anti-trafficking accords that were incorporated into the humanitarian activities of the League of Nations (LON) and United Nations (UN) and signed by a variety of states. Which states cooperated to address the traffic in women and girls and why did they do so? Social science scholars interested in the formation of and adherence to international norms would view the diffusion of the anti-trafficking movement as the result of the successful creation of a global humanitarian ""moral order"" prohibiting the sexual exploitation of women. Through a comparative-historical analysis of archival materials from the involved international voluntary associations (IVAs) and the LON, however, I show that the issue of trafficking was initially raised as a humanitarian concern by one liberal feminist IVA that sought to fight the worldwide sexual exploitation of women and successfully usurped by another IVA that used a rhetoric of gender protection to frame prostitution in national terms. The latter approach appealed to states interested in increasing their power to define the boundaries of nation and empire. In addition to examining the overall construction of the movement, I also compare its diffusion in particular countries and the consequences for the implementation of anti-trafficking measures. The relative influence of the different IVAs and the varying importance of prostitution to specific state and nation-building projects in the Netherlands, France and Italy led to different applications of anti-trafficking measures in metropole and colony. Using the international movement as a case study by which to examine the politics of humanitarianism, this project shows that interests and ideology are not mutually exclusive in humanitarian efforts and that IVAs may in fact operate to increase rather than challenge state power. The anti-trafficking movement resonated precisely because it could be used politically to bolster territorial interests at a time of nation-state consolidation, imperial growth and rivalry, and the development of the interstate system.",305344190,,Dissertations & Theses," Limoncelli, Stephanie A.LimoncelliA.StephanieLimoncelli, Stephanie A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1196414821 , 34623381 , 66569 , 9780542768057 , 3224339 , 3224339", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,9.78E+12, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305344190?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Humanitarianism , International social movements , Politics , Prostitution , Reformers , Trafficking , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+humanitarianism%3A+States%2C+reformers%2C+and+the%0Ainternational+movement+to+combat+the+traffic+in+women%2C+1875%E2%80%931960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Limoncelli%2C+Stephanie+A.&amp;isbn=9780542768057&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.955719814,0.947810462,3396,Left,human rights,"peace and security, human rights, economic development, the environment, and human development",For a future that works: new movements for social and economic change.,"The thesis starts by identifying a global problematique, increasingly threatening human survival, which is composed of four great, interlinked problem areas: war, insecurity and militarism; the persistence of poverty; the denial of human rights; and environmental destruction. The conventional approaches to this four-fold crisis are analysed by a comparative discussion of the work of the three United Nations Commissions which were set up to deal with one aspect of it: the Brandt, Palme and Brundtland Commissions, with a focus on economic development, peace and security, and environment and development respectively. The thesis finds these Commissions' analyses partial and flawed and proceeds to discussion of the issues by examining the lives and work of individuals who and organisations which have been involved at the grassroots level, mobilising people and lobbying decision-makers, or devising and implementing concrete strategies of change. The thesis ranges widely over the issues concerned with chapters on peace and security, human rights, economic development, the environment, and human development. The conclusion of the thesis identifies the root causes of the crisis as Western scientism- and developmentalism, and the unfettered, inappropriate and irresponsible power of the nation-state. In specifically addressing each of these causes, the new movements for social and economic change are engaged in a process of democratisation, the success of which is by no means guaranteed but which is a prerequisite for long-term peace, human dignity and ecological sustainability.",301515050,,Dissertations & Theses," Ekins, P.W.EkinsP.W.Ekins, P.W.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756267781 , 44401431 , 101309 , U030507 , U030507", Dissertation/Thesis,1990,, English, English,,1990,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301515050?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law,, 0616 International law, International law," (UMI)AAIU030507 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=For+a+future+that+works%3A++new+movements+for+social+and+economic+change.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ekins%2C+P.W.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.479059725,0.944315485,3348,Left,human rights,"Israeli Committee Against House Demolition (ICAHD). First formed in 1997, it is a coalition of social movement organizations (SMOs) in the Israeli radical left peace and human rights movement","Organizing heterodoxies: The Israeli Committee Against House Demolition and the Israeli radical left, 1997â€“2000","Based on nineteen months of ethnographic field research in Israel/Palestine (including participant observation and in-depth interviews), this study presents an analysis of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolition (ICAHD). First formed in 1997, it is a coalition of social movement organizations (SMOs) in the Israeli radical left peace and human rights movement. This project traces significant organizational, and wider movement, dynamics from the time of ICAHD's inception until the outbreak of the second Palestinian Intifada in September 2000. While countless scholars investigate historical and contemporary aspects of the political conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, relatively little research attention is directed towards the efforts of Israeli and Palestinian activists towards conflict resolution. Following a brief description of the development of the Israeli peace movement, this study identifies and analyzes several mobilization issues relevant to organized activist forces in the Israeli radical movement in the final years of the Oslo peace process. Building on recent collective action theories, this dissertation endorses analytical openness to the structuralist, rationalist, and culturalist dynamics of contentious politics. ICAHD members, as well as its organizational constituencies, are characterized by wide ideological and strategic heterogeneity, and in the first three years of its existence, this informal movement organization faced several overlapping strategic dilemmas. Investigating the historical and day-to-day dynamics of the committee, this study analyses various factors that influenced the strategic choices individual, and teams of, activists made during multiple types of mobilizations. By examining the impact of ICAHD's constituencies on how core leaders and activists engaged with dilemmas of organizational structure, strategic vision, inter-organizational alliances, mobilizing and funding opportunities, and overall goal selection, this dissertation identifies mechanisms (structural, organizational and cultural) that affected strategic decisions regarding mobilization, and outcomes of contentious politics. The study concludes with a discussion of the relevance of its findings for the sociological study of collective protest. It suggests the extension of future research on these themes in more transnational and macro-theoretical directions.",305364465,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldberg, AvrumGoldbergAvrumGoldberg, Avrum", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1104984541 , 33189761 , 66569 , 9780494128497 , 0494128496 , NR12849 , NR12849", Dissertation/Thesis,2005," 9780494128497 , 0494128496", English, English,,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2005,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305364465?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Heterodoxies , Israeli Committee Against House Demolition , Left wing , Organizing , Radical",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Organizing+heterodoxies%3A+The+Israeli+Committee+Against+House+Demolition+and+the+Israeli+radical+left%2C+1997%E2%80%932000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2005-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldberg%2C+Avrum&amp;isbn=9780494128497&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.242491341,0.93466226,3111,Left,human rights,child labour in India,A social constructionist account of children's rights under the conditions of globalisation: the issue of child labour in India.,"This research draws on Neil Stammers' social constructionist account of human rights and power in Human Rights and Power (1993) and Social Movements and the Social Construction of Human Rights (1999). It draws on Stammers' thesis that, first, human rights are socially constructed in particular historical, social, political, and economic contexts and, second, ideas and practices with respect of human rights have historically both challenged and sustained particular relations of power. This research therefore uses social constructionism to broaden the children's rights-child labour debate, and to put children's rights into context; thereby to demonstrate how the concept is being used in the child labour debate - especially at the international and national (India) levels - without acknowledging that the rights discourse can be and has been used to justify the type of activity which leads to the exploitation of children. In doing so, this thesis examines how three Delhi-based NGOs are using children's rights to challenge child labour practice; Butterflies, the South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, and the Bonded Labour Liberation Front.Â  They are engaged in what I describe as 'a struggle on two fronts'. Where, first, they are using children's rights as a 'tool' to challenge relations and structures of power and privilege embedded in everyday Indian life - caste, class, religion, gender - in order to bring about social transformation. Simultaneously, second, children's rights are used to expose how the rights discourse has been constructed and utilised at the international level without acknowledging how it can be used to justify precisely the type of activity which leads to the exploitation of children. Therefore if the concept is to be useful for activists and scholars dedicated to challenging human rights abuses, it must be used to understand how unequal power relations and structures are sustained and be used to challenge the status quo.",301648923,,Dissertations & Theses," Sanghera, G.SangheraG.Sanghera, G.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760262551 , 45021601 , 101309 , U182306 , U182306", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301648923?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIU182306 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+social+constructionist+account+of+children%27s+rights+under+the+conditions+of+globalisation%3A+the+issue+of+child+labour+in+India.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sanghera%2C+G.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.755913039,0.928155987,3311,Left,human rights,international criminal justice regime,Affective states: Rethinking passion in global politics,"This dissertation recasts passion as a vital topic for international relations, a creative dimension of global life, and a potential resource for international law and ethics. It develops an account of how affect connects people to nation-states, as well as political movements above and below the nation. It then considers the implications of this account for the study of international conflict and international criminal justice. The dissertation begins with a genealogy of passion in international relations theory, arguing that existing perspectives are only partly equipped to theorize the micropolitics of affect: Realists understand the importance of passions but cast them as unchanging aspects of human nature, and constructivistsâ€”focusing on identity as the primary channel of social constructionâ€”miss the affective depth of political agency. From this genealogy, the dissertation develops a theoretical account of the global micropolitics of affect. This work explains how memories and habits from a variety of historical moments and a range of social, economic, and cultural fields become folded into contemporary political events and encounters. Drawing especially from the work of Gilles Deleuze, it underlines the nonsubjective dimension of affect and traces its significance for understanding collective agency. In this view, affect consists not of subjective feelings but of habits and other inarticulate states that tie individuals to multiple constituencies; it forges political identities before these are recognized as such. The dissertation explores the significance of these contentions for the study of international conflict and international justice and reconciliation. It takes two so-called ethnic conflicts from the 1990sâ€”in the former Yugoslavia and Rwandaâ€”and identifies the specific practices and events that induced affective energy and escalated violence in each case. Tracing the micropolitics of affect shows how wider ranges of memory and more plural and dynamic sites of agency are involved in these conflicts than is commonly supposed. The dissertation considers the implications of theses ideas for both the international criminal justice regime and non-legalist alternatives to criminal justice. It argues that rethinking passion opens new possibilities for juridical and quasi juridical institutions to intervene productively in the micropolitics of affect.",304993448,,Dissertations & Theses," Ross, Andrew A.

The intent of the research is to determine whether NITs, primarily computers and the Internet, are helping to reduce, maintain, or intensify ethnic conflict within the movement. The study explores implications for political mobilization by examining what groups within the movement have access to which technologies, and how these groups understand and use global media and the discourses they produce. The research is a multi-sited ethnography conceived within the epistemological framework of standpoint theory, providing an empirically grounded exploration of the Burmese opposition movement in both its local and global contexts. It employs participant observation, in-depth interviews and discourse analysis to examine the impact of global communications at the local level. The work begins with an historical examination of the development of the modern state in Burma, which provides the context for exploring how militarization, gender and ethnicity have affected the development of nationalisms and conflict defined largely as â€œethnicâ€ in nature. This is followed by a discussion of how the history and current state of communications both inside and outside Burma constrain attitudes toward the possible uses of communications technologies and media among the opposition-in-exile. An overview of opposition media investigates the degree to which these media have opened a space for dialogue between groups. Interviews with opposition activists and refugees from Burma demonstrate how the Burmese regime's militaristic values are both perpetuated and countered within the opposition movement itself. The research finds that the introduction of NITs and patterns of foreign funding have reinforced existing hierarchies within the opposition movement. Finally, this study demonstrates how the â€œlocalâ€ reinvents the â€œglobalâ€ through the use of a global discourse of human rights which acts subtly but powerfully to shape social conventions within the movement. This results in an unstated hierarchy of human rights that perpetuates the inequitable gender and ethnic composition of the opposition political groups and the hierarchy of access and use of technologies among these groups.",288341539,,Dissertations & Theses," Brooten, Lisa BoothBrootenBoothLisaBrooten, Lisa Booth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765246291 , 30404571 , 66569 , 3081110 , 3081110", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/288341539?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies",," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," Mass media , Cultural anthropology , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Burmese , Communication , Gender , Global communications , Human rights , Myanmar , Opposition-in-exile , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+communications%2C+local+conceptions%3A+Human+rights+and+the+politics+of+communication+among+the+Burmese+opposition+-in+-exile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brooten%2C+Lisa+Booth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.686673363,0.89445211,1753,Left,human rights,Catholic clergy sexual abuse survivor movement,Breaking the Silence: The Catholic Sexual Abuse Survivor Movement in Chicago,"This dissertation is a history of the lay Catholic clergy sexual abuse survivor movement, analyzed through the lens of three survivor advocacy groups: Victims of Clergy Abuse Linkup (LINKUP), the Survivorâ€™s Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), and the Coalition of Concerned Catholics (CCC). More than any other population, the community of survivors comprised by the overlapping membership of these three lay organizations has shaped the discursive framework through which the U.S. news media have understood, articulated, and debated the pain of clergy sexual abuse. Drawing on four years of archival and ethnographic research, I argue that the Chicago survivor movement descended from the moral and ecclesiological visions of two preceding generations of Chicago Catholic activists, particularly in survivorsâ€™ commitment to womenâ€™s liturgical participation and the theology of personalism (as descended through the Catholic Worker movement). This research thus demonstrates that American survivors were not, as prior studies have suggested, coopted into a liberal reform agenda by the so-called â€œCatholic Left.â€ Rather, in both substance and form the ecclesiological and legal changes sought by LINKUP, SNAP, and CCC stem from the personal connections between the three women who founded the Chicago survivor movement, Jeanne Miller, Barbara Blaine, and Marilyn Steffel, and their mentors, particularly Nina Polcyn and Patricia Crowley. By harnessing the pain and suffering of betrayal, the Chicago survivor movement embodies an alternative vision of Catholic social justice. I introduce the term â€œpolitics of survivorhoodâ€ to describe this vision of the disenfranchised. The key politics of survivorhood explored herein are: (i) the recovery of voice as a means to survive abuse; (ii) the privileging of local communal conscience and democratic processes; (iii) the suspicion of patriarchal communities, prayers, and texts; (iv) a lived anthropology of communal suffering; (v) an approach to the â€œwhole personâ€ that integrates medical and religious approaches to heal body and soul; (vi) a set of judicial and legislative reforms that imagines global child abuse activism through a distinctly American Catholic framework; and (vii) a critique of clerical culture in favor of the post-Vatican II ecclesiological definition of church as â€œthe People of God.â€",1720843581,,Dissertations & Theses," Clites, Brian J.ClitesJ.BrianClites, Brian J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3831674521 , 99498432 , 66569 , 9781339076515 , 3724212 , 3724212", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1720843581?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history",," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history"," Religion , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American history , Catholic , Laity , Roman catholicism , Sexual abuse , Vatican ii",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Breaking+the+Silence%3A+The+Catholic+Sexual+Abuse+Survivor+Movement+in+Chicago&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clites%2C+Brian+J.&amp;isbn=9781339076515&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.253141786,0.999043069,3569,Left,indigeneous ,Great Plains indigeneous populations,"Undermining landscape, gender and indigenous peoples in contemporary North American Great Plains literature","My interdisciplinary study focuses on the imaginative construction of the Great Plains in the region's contemporary literature. The term colonial imagination first arrived on the Great Plains without an adequate paradigm to describe the region or the experience. European explorers and settlers described the region as a desert, until more fertile lands had been largely claimed, at which time the Great Plains are described as a virgin garden. The majority of regional descriptors have fallen into one or the other of these inadequate paradigms. Both paradigms of desert and garden carry set interpretations--of environment, women and Indigenous People. These paradigms treat all three as aspects of the region to be colonized, which is manifested in a Subject-Object relationship. These Great Plains paradigms have been discussed individually in several critical, historical, and literary studies of the region. However, we find ourselves on the brink of a new millennium, and extensive sedentary habitation has proven that European conceptual models are not particularly useful here. Given current searches for sustainability and the revamping of political and social models, are fiction writers and filmmakers leading a re-visioning of the Great Plains? If so, are they undermining a colonial patriarchy, or are they maintaining their predecessors' failed value systems? My dissertation addresses the following questions: How do landscape and Indigenous peoples and women figure within each author's imaginative construction? Do writers of various backgrounds construct these paradigms differently? If we envision these constructions as a continuum, with the left side marked by previous European conceptions, how does the continuum shift at the close of the twentieth century? What demarcates movement toward the right? To what degree are the environment, Indigenous peoples, and women imaginatively constructed as colonial ground?

The recent history of the Philippines features an illustrious culture of mass-based organization, as local populations protest national development strategies that promote rapid economic growth and integration into world markets at the expense of local social and environmental concerns. Specifically, an anti-large scale mining social movement in the Philippines has developed in reaction to the liberalization of the national mining industry with the Mining Act of 1995, which opened the country's rich mineral resources to 100 percent ownership by foreign corporations. Through the development of a protest movement against such neoliberal policies, local communities and their regional, national and international representative organizations have coalesced around the promotion of indigenous identity, stressing the environmental and economic rights guaranteed to indigenous peoples by the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997. In promoting such rights, these agents strive to continue to develop local mining industries and profit from local lands and resources, which indigenous communities have practiced and exploited since time immemorial. Ultimately, the anti-large scale mining movement struggles to maintain an identity as a social movement protesting the globalization of natural resource exploitation, while promoting the rights of indigenous natural resource exploitation. The research focuses on Baguio City in Benguet Province of the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Northern Philippines and investigates the challenges of organizing social movements to bring local, indigenous concerns into the national and international development and environmentalist discourses.",1696781854,,Dissertations & Theses," Bulanda, RobertBulandaRobertBulanda, Robert", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3745052751 , 97575522 , 66569 , 9781321813968 , 1590997 , 1590997", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1696781854?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+organization+of+indigenous+resistance+to+neoliberal+extractive+industry+development+in+the+Cordillera+of+the+northern+Philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bulanda%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=9781321813968&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.868045858,0.986277756,1073,Left,indigeneous ,indigenous communities in Peru,"â€œLooking to the governmentâ€: Community, politics and the production of memory and silences in twentieth-century Peru, Ayacucho","This dissertation explores from a cultural and linguistic standpoint the political process in the relationship between the state and indigenous communities of Ayacucho, Peru, throughout the twentieth-century.

Despite awareness of this fact from within the international Indigenous movement, city life is still represented as being peripheral to the authentic centre of Indigenous life 'at home'. In general, researchers have only just begun to critique this representation and attend seriously to the new forms and processes of Indigenous sociality that underpin such diasporic geographies. In this thesis, I examine the politics surrounding urban Indigenous mobility and propose an analytical approach to its study based on the concept of diaspora. I develop this diasporic framework with regard to the situation of Ainu---the Indigenous people in Japan---resident in and around the greater metropolitan region of Tokyo ( KantÅ ). Serious interest in KantÅ resident Ainu history has been lacking in both academic and public domains, to the extent that the array of issues affecting and reflecting their social organization have represented a highly marginal if not altogether overlooked point of interest within the general field of Ainu studies. I demonstrate that to concentrate on the diasporic history and dynamics of Ainu resident in the capital region underlines the misguided regionalization of contemporary Ainu studies and affairs to northern Japan. It also raises important questions concerning Ainu identity, self-organization and political rights that contests established ideas about Ainu culture and society. On a broader level, it provides an original example of how Indigenous people negotiate their experience of the city and together form their own places, memories and connections through social relations in and beyond the urban environment.",304956990,,Dissertations & Theses," Watson, Mark KennethWatsonKennethMarkWatson, Mark Kenneth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1150817531 , 33585981 , 66569 , 9780494140574 , NR14057 , NR14057", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,9.78E+12, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304956990?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Ainu , Indigenous , Japan , Kanto , Urban culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Kant%C5%8D+resident+Ainu+and+the+urban+Indigenous+experience&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Watson%2C+Mark+Kenneth&amp;isbn=9780494140574&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.007585069,0.960836517,3535,Left,indigeneous ,indigenous communities in Dominica (Caribe),Carib to creole: contact and culture exchange in dominica,"This is an ethnohistorical study of the Carib people who inhabit the Carib Territory (officially called the Carib Reserve), on the northeastern coast of Dominica which is one of the islands of the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean. It analyses the historical background of the Caribs from the time of their initial contact with Europeans and Africans through the period of colonisation, and considers the effects which the centuries of culture exchange have had on the indigenous societies of Dominica up to the present. This heritage is considered in relation to the cultural revival movement which has developed since the 1980s as part of the hemispheric action being initiated by indigenous peoples of the Americas for greater recognition and rights. Promoting Carib identity in this context has become important to the community on many levels. The thesis assesses the manner in which the Caribs are using their history, material culture, and association with their land to articulate their indigenousness in the face of the centuries of cultural and biological admixture with people of European and African descent known as Creoles. The thesis concludes that although it may be true that these symbols are distorted and exaggerated, they are not entirely invented, for they originate in the history and culture of the Carib people. Even if, in many ways, the Caribs have become as Creole as their fellow countrymen, the social fact is, that in the present circumstances, they see it as important and advantageous to define themselves as Caribs in their engagement with Creole nationalism and the world beyond. By promoting their association with the cultural markers of Caribness, their cultural activists seek to engage with the current international concern and interest in indigenous groups in the hope that it might eventually reap some good for their people.",301491240,,Dissertations & Theses," Honychurch, LennoxHonychurchLennoxHonychurch, Lennox", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757610061 , 44651381 , 101309 , U097414 , U097414", Dissertation/Thesis,1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301491240?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAIU097414 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Carib+to+creole%3A+contact+and+culture+exchange+in+dominica&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Honychurch%2C+Lennox&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.902720779,0.924834641,3023,Left,indigeneous ,indigenous communities in Mexico,Narratives of location: Televisual media and the production of indigenous identities in Mexico,"This dissertation examines how indigenous identities are being produced in Mexico by both the state and indigenous activists through the use of televisual technologies at the height of official pluralism in the 1990s. I discuss practices of self-representationâ€”or â€œmaking culture visibleâ€â€”as narratives of location. Location and production emerge as key cultural practices and what gets produced in the process of locating is the reworking of indigenous identities. Indigenous identities emerge as contested and hybrid, somewhere â€œin-betweenâ€ notions of traditional and modern. Mexico's National Indigenous Institute (INI) and the indigenous video program it created are considered against the indigenous autonomy movement; these are the broader institutional and sociopolitical arenas for understanding the emergence of â€œ video indÃ­gena â€ in Mexico. I look at a variety of different actors and argue that each is engaged in locating themselves and re-locating indigenous subjectivity in terms of the national-state. The production of â€œconsumable cultureâ€ on video serves the state's interest in promoting non-threatening indigenous identities. For indigenous peoples, â€œmodularâ€ representations of themselves underpin their â€œimagined communityâ€ and help them organize locally, to preserve notions of community, as well as nationally and transnationally to demand their rights. The emergence of video indÃ­gena is complicated with narratives of several indigenous organizations in Oaxaca, Mexico that discuss initiatives to establish regional communications networks before INI launched its indigenous video program as well as attempts to move video indÃ­gena beyond state-sponsorship. An ethnographic analysis of a community-based media collective in Oaxaca further â€œthickensâ€ our understanding of video indÃ­gena by looking at local issues of power and representation. The concluding chapter of this dissertation explores the dynamics of making culture visible in transnational circuits of indigenous media exhibition.

Their interaction is partially situated within conflicting understandings of development and its objectives, in which development is understood both in economic and cultural terms. State elites and NGO personnel typically view development in terms of economic modernization, and state policies and NGO projects for Amazonian indigenous communities have included agrarian reform, colonization, and the wider participation of indigenous people in the market economy. Elites and NGOs attempt to impose particular visions of economic and cultural behavior on indigenous people as â€œbackwardsâ€ and â€œunderdeveloped,â€ while hoping to transform them into â€œmodern,â€ â€œproductiveâ€ national citizens. Since the 1960s, indigenous leaders have used federations to contest these models of development by negotiating with and/or challenging state and NGO officials, rejecting the perpetuation of culturally-based hierarchies with pseudo-racial undertones which relegate indigenous people to the bottom. Increasingly since the 1980s, and in the context of neoliberal reforms and the rapid growth of NGOs in Ecuador and elsewhere, indigenous leaders, instead of rejecting â€œdevelopmentâ€ altogether, have used it as a stake in cultural politics by forging alliances with sustainable development and conservation NGOs. They have proposed alternative visions of development to reconfigure local economies in culturally-sensitive terms, dismantle prevailing â€œracialâ€ hierarchies, and reconceptualize the Ecuadorian nation as plurinational. The study of indigenous federations helps broaden our understanding of the relationships between social movements and the state in the context of economic, political, and socio-cultural processes shaping them. Ideologies of development, globally conceived by international development organizations and locally implemented through neoliberal reforms, decentralization, and permissive expansion of NGOs, present a multi-dimensional stage on which economic and cultural politics are played out. This has further implications for our understanding of â€œrace,â€ ethnicity, and the politics of culture, as development ideologies and practices generate prescriptions for the ethnic and cultural (pseudo-racial) composition of local populations. Development becomes intertwined with issues of cultural politics and national identity, as different actors create and contest conflicting representations of each other.",305492721,,Dissertations & Theses," Wilson, Patrick CharlesWilsonCharlesPatrickWilson, Patrick Charles", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726485751 , 28632021 , 66569 , 9780493696829 , 0493696822 , 3054356 , 3054356", Dissertation/Thesis,2002," 9780493696829 , 0493696822", English, English,,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305492721?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0501 Economics , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Political science , Economics , Social structure , Native peoples , Nongovernmental organizations--NGOs , Studies , Politics"," Social sciences , Amazon , Culture , Development , Ecuador , Indigenous federations , Nongovernmental organizations , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indigenous+federations%2C+NGOs%2C+and+the+state%3A+++*Development+and+the+politics+of+culture+in+Ecuador%27s+Amazon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+Patrick+Charles&amp;isbn=9780493696829&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.369306149,0.902491527,250,Left,indigeneous ,indigenous social movements,"Ethnodevelopment in Latin America: Political competition and the making of ethnically-targeted participatory policy in Ecuador, Peru and Guatemala, 1985â€“2005","An empirical puzzle presented by the surprising appearance and variation of a new type of participatory ethnically-targeted policy paradigm in Latin America motivates this dissertation. In the 1980s, Latin American countries such as Ecuador and Peru began to enact significant ethnodevelopment policies, or social and development policies that take into account indigenous poverty and that do so with a focus on culture and self-management. Other Latin American countries with similarly large indigenous populations and high levels of indigenous poverty such as Guatemala, in contrast, continued during this time to ignore ethnicity in domestic development policies, as had been the region-wide trend in decades past. Further adding to this puzzling variation, while Ecuador began immediately to implement these policies on the ground, in Peru, the strong policy paradigm was not translated into services and programs as promised in the law. Drawing from elite interviews and extensive analysis of each country's legal and organizational literature, among other sources, I find that the most common explanations for the appearance of multicultural policies, such as those looking to levels of racism and international pressure, cannot explain this empirical puzzle. Rather, I find that distinctive patterns of domestic political competition and social mobilization best make sense of the three countries' ethnodevelopment policy records. Specifically, policy-makers unattached to core constituencies with interests and ideologies in opposition to any part of the ethnodevelopment paradigm were in the best position to reach out to the uncaptured constituency represented by indigenous communities. In Latin American countries, center-left presidents have thus been uniquely situated to use ethnodevelopment policy-making to appeal to indigenous voters when tight competition provides incentives for new sources of support. Only in Ecuador and Peru did center-left presidents take power during the period under study, and therefore only in these two countries was the paradigm introduced. In Guatemala, where no center-left president was elected, no ethnodevelopment paradigm took shape. With the first policies placed on the legislative agenda in Ecuador and Peru by presidents of the center-left, formerly marginalized groups became perceived as a constituency based on ethnicity, rather than simply as a larger part of the general peasantry, poor or other class-based grouping. Now in â€œplay,â€ political actors in these two countries perceived the targeted ethnic groups as a possible voting bloc and one to be fought over when tight competition necessitated such action. Having seen benefits accrued by the center-left, other presidents from along the political spectrum thus helped to continue building the ethnodevelopment paradigm when in need of new sources of support. The strength and presence of indigenous social movements best explains the variation in ethnodevelopment policy implementation levels in Ecuador and Peru. Specifically, both their early presence in pushing for multicultural policy as well as their links to local communities meant that indigenous social movements in Ecuador were in a beneficial position to see that implementation was carried out. The lack of such mobilization in Peru meant that the strong legislation that passed stayed â€œon the books,â€ and off the ground. This dissertation represents an original endeavor to explore a practically important empirical phenomenon that is insufficiently explained by the extant academic and policy literature. The broader argument put forth here not only makes sense of the particular empirical puzzle that motivates the study, but also shows evidence of traveling to other global contexts and policy-making situations. Thus, not only does the dissertation have important practical implications, but the findings here also contribute to the broader study of ethnic politics, policy-making, social movements and political parties.",220001086,,Dissertations & Theses," Chartock, SarahChartockSarahChartock, Sarah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1642934581 , 41871131 , 66569 , 9780549932598 , 3338673 , 3338673", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/220001086?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Political science , Ethnic studies , Competition , Minority & ethnic groups , Latin America , Ecuador , Peru , Guatemala"," Social sciences , Development with identity , Ecuador , Ethnodevelopment , Guatemala , Indigenous , Indigenous peoples , Latin American politics , Participatory policy , Peru , Political competition , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ethnodevelopment+in+Latin+America%3A+Political+competition+and+the+making+of+ethnically-targeted+participatory+policy+in+Ecuador%2C+Peru+and+Guatemala%2C+1985%E2%80%932005&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chartock%2C+Sarah&amp;isbn=9780549932598&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.674154313,0.90039166,409,Left,indigeneous ,indigenous peoples and social movement theoyr,The legitimacy of indigenous peoples' norms under international law,"I assess Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms under international law against a definition of legitimacy that draws on contemporary international relations and international legal scholarship, especially that of Thomas Franck in addition to constructivism, transnational legal process theory and social movement theory. I argue that Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms under intentional law carry legitimacy. As such, they have both the capacity and the potential to pull states into compliance. First, Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms under international law have â€˜procedural legitimacy.â€™ While the proliferation of international institutions engaged in international law making on Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms undermines the transparency and certainty ideal in a law-making process, the international legal system has reflexively countered these legitimacy deficits with institutional cooperation and robust law-making procedures. In addition, this procedural legitimacy is enhanced by Indigenous peoplesâ€™ participation in international law-making as it realises their just claims to self-determination and to deliberative law-making. Likewise, Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms under international law have â€˜substance legitimacyâ€™: international law is ultimately fairer as a result of the content of these norms. Indeterminacy and incoherence caused by the fragmentation of international Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms, which can be legitimacy negative, have been mitigated by dialogue between institutions making and applying Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms. Dialogic interactions minimise conflict between, and inconsistent articulations of, Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms sourced in different international instruments, as well as the broader incoherence in the principles undergirding them, restoring some clarity to the law. Finally, state engagement with norms in international and domestic for a, often propelled by non-state actor initiatives, leads them over time to internalise international norms, which is increasingly the result of statesâ€™ interaction with Indigenous peoplesâ€™ norms under international law.

Actors within government and private networks, the actor's conceptions of cooperation, and external pressure from other powers, are seen as explanatory factors. Three actors in linking-pin positions between governments and the private sphere are in focus: the Nordic Interparliamentary Union (NIPU), the Norden Associations and the Social Democratic labour movements cooperation committee. The study ends up with the creation of the Nordic Council, an organization which should be seen in relation to both NIPU and the European Council. Three hypotheses are formulated. (1) The organization of cooperation is dependent on the magnitude of external pressure. In the sphere of government initiatives for organization have been taken in times of changes in international relations, opening windows of opportunities or threat. (2) A necessary condition for the organization of cooperation is a leading actor who takes initiatives and is ready to accept the costs and consequences. Under the period considered, Sweden has been the regional power. However, as an international small power, Swedish governments have to a great extent been adapting to external pressures. (3) A necessary condition for the organization of regional unity is a kind of nationalism that crosses state borders.

In the present analysis, I focus on individuals' social identity and their positions as both volunteers and national representatives, claiming individuals struggled to internalize both of these role identities. In turn, I also scrutinized the volunteer project by examining its group dynamics, arguing they displayed a continuum between cooperation and conflict. Investigating identity and group dynamics sheds light on international volunteerism from the bottom-up; from the perspectives of volunteers themselves.

Organized in 1921 by missionaries recently returned from Japan and funded by East Coast liberal Protestant organizations, the Survey sought to challenge anti-Japanese (and to a lesser degree anti-Chinese) racial discrimination on the Pacific Coast. Between January 1924 and March 1925, liberal Protestant organizers hired sociologists, university professors and students, and missionaries to collect interviews, life histories, and miscellany among white and Asian populations on the Pacific Coast. This study focuses especially on the incentives that drove liberal Protestants to found the Survey and the incentives that drove first-generation Chinese and Japanese immigrants and members of the second generation to participate in the project. For those Asian Americans who participated in the study, the Survey became a forum in which to describe to white Americans the immigration experience and simultaneously challenge racial intolerance. Liberal Protestant organizers used the Survey to bolster their advocacy for trans-Pacific internationalism and launch an international discussion of anti-Asian racial hostility. This dissertation is significant for the way it places the Survey of Race Relations in a trans-Pacific context. It considers social and political factors in the United States and East Asia that shaped both the liberal Protestant movement and first- and second-generation Chinese and Japanese Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Finally, this study draws on the two largest archives of the Survey of Race Relations as well as on archives, biographies, correspondences, and oral interviews not utilized by historians who have written about the Survey in the past. Taken together, these sources lead to new conclusions regarding the history of racial liberalism in the American Protestant church as well as the social and political history of first- and second-generation Chinese and Japanese American in the first decades of the twentieth century.",815736014,,Dissertations & Theses," Griffith, Sarah M.GriffithM.SarahGriffith, Sarah M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2203727371 , 55951211 , 66569 , 9781124330341 , 3427844 , 3427844", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,9.78E+12, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/815736014?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history"," History , American history , Asian American Studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Asian-American , Comparative race and ethnicity , Liberal Protestantism , Pacific history , Racial equality , Trans-Pacific , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=Camping+the+Dirty+Dozens%3A+The+Queer+Resources+of+Black+Nationalist+Invective&amp;title=Callaloo&amp;issn=01612492&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=290&amp;au=Ross%2C+Marlon+B&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Callaloo&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0000320638&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1353%2Fcal.2000.0060,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.482960712,0.892460085,2708,Left,internationalism,Modern Olympic Movement had quickly formulated a didactic international social agenda that emphasized peace and cooperation among nation,"Theories of beauty and modern sport: Pierre de Coubertin's aesthetic imperative for the Modern Olympic Movement, 1894-1914","In 1894 when the plan to initiate Olympic Games for modern athletes was introduced to a congress of international delegates in Paris, the relationship between sport and the broader societal and cultural realities of the period were hypothetical and speculative. Although the Modern Olympic Movement had quickly formulated a didactic international social agenda that emphasized peace and cooperation among nations, it struggled to identify a practical mode of cultural expression. Between 1894-1914, the founder of the movement, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, worked tirelessly to develop a cultural theory of sport that would complement the ideology of the Modern Olympic Movement. Coubertin named this ideological foundation, Olympism, and stated that it was, in part, an aesthetic idea. The purpose of this thesis is to study and analyse the evolution of Coubertin's aesthetic idea of Olympism during this period. The objective is to understand how philosophical ideas about art and beauty contributed to the discursive, and ultimately cultural, articulation of this modern sporting ideology. Historical analysis focuses on the personalities, publications and events that incorporated aesthetic concepts into the discourses of sport and Olympism. Correspondence between members of the International Olympic Committee, the monthly periodical Revue Olympique, and official reports from Olympic Games and Olympic Congresses provide the base of primary sources. The aesthetic content expressed in these sources, and its function in Coubertin's theory of sport and the Olympic Games, is examined from a Marxist-based critical theory perspective. This thesis identifies and describes three distinct periods in which the aesthetic idea of Olympism became increasingly intertwined with a cultural theory of sport and public spectacle. Primary sources also reveal that the Modern Olympic Movement was, indeed, influenced by a variety of art movements that contributed to the cultural landscape of modernity. This thesis argues that the aesthetic idea of Olympism reflected a belief that cultivating an appreciation for the beauty of sport would produce a sound, class-based society capable of responding cohesively and morally to the challenging conditions of modernity. This appreciation for the beauty of sport was described by Coubertin as the ""taste for sport."" The cultivation of ""taste"" incorporated the experiences of athletes and spectators and represented an aesthetic imperative for the Modern Olympic Movement. At the core of this cultural theory of sport was the desire to see athletes and spectators constitute themselves aesthetically, morally and socially through sport. On one level, this was a noble and ideologically-based scheme for social progress. Theoretically and practically, however, the notion of cultivating taste through sport was fraught with limitations. Ultimately, Coubertin's aesthetic idea of Olympism was constrained by the contemporary social, historical, and philosophical discourses of his epoch that reflected the concerns of a bourgeois, capitalist, male dominated society. Consequently, his theory of beautiful sport was little more than a theory of sport spectatorship that dealt awkwardly with the actual aesthetic experiences derived from athletic participation. Furthermore, the aesthetic idea of Olympism failed to account for the tastes and experiences of women or other sectors of society whose voices fell on the deaf ears of most bourgeois moral and social reformers of this period.",304402953,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, Douglas A.BrownA.DouglasBrown, Douglas A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 736660521 , 27577361 , 66569 , 9780612212817 , 0612212815 , NQ21281 , NQ21281", Dissertation/Thesis,1997," 9780612212817 , 0612212815", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304402953?accountid=14496," 0582 History , 0814 Recreation"," 0582 History , 0814 Recreation"," 0582 History , 0814 Recreation",," 0582 History , 0814 Recreation"," History , Recreation"," Social sciences , Coubertin, Pierre de , Olympic Games",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Theories+of+beauty+and+modern+sport%3A+Pierre+de+Coubertin%27s+aesthetic+imperative+for+the+Modern+Olympic+Movement%2C+1894-1914&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Douglas+A.&amp;isbn=9780612212817&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.272717602,0.994936594,272,Left,labor,Yugoslavian labor resistance,Economic reform and the â€˜double movementâ€™ in Yugoslavia: An analysis of labor unrest and ethno-nationalism in the 1980s,"This study is the first complete analysis of social upheaval in Yugoslavia in the 1980s, especially on the groundswell of organized labor resistance that emerged in resistance to rapid economic transformation. This study introduces a new data source on ""events of labor unrest"" (ELUs) in the period, consisting of nearly 1500 reports of labor unrest (RLUs) culled from the former Yugoslavia's main Serbo-Croatian news publications from the years 1980-1988. The data advance a striking argument and a new historical perspective on the causes of ELUs, their direct consequences, their distribution, and their role in the breakdown of the Yugoslav Federation. Labor unrest emerged as a threat to the Federal Government of Yugoslavia in response to the many attempts to introduce the policies of economic ""shock therapy"" promoted by the International Monetary Fund. These policies sought to reduce wages, close unprofitable firms, reorganize social relationships within the workplace, and otherwise control inflation. The death of Tito in 1980 is shown to have created a leadership vacuum that was filled by a series of increasingly 'disembedded' economic experts who were accountable mainly to the IMF, the agency that acted as gatekeeper of foreign investment in the face of the Federation's growing credit problems. As the decade wore on, workers across the Federation resorted to striking as the primary means of communicating their dissatisfaction with the federal government and its policies. This study tracks the development of the workers' movement Federation-wide, and also pays considerable attention to several case studies: Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Kosovo, and Macedonia. The similarities in the development of an organized labor movement in these regions are shown to correspond to similar processes of extreme nationalist parties capturing the momentum for social change generated by labor actions in all but one case. The study applies Karl Polanyi's framework of ""The Great Transformation"" to explain how labor emerged in the interest of the ""self-protection of society"" to resist the attempt to ""disembed"" the market from social relations, and then posits that this very process of social self-protection created a political impasse out of which emerged a process of fragmentation along sectarian lines that violently terminated the possibility for the Federation's existence.",304914807,,Dissertations & Theses," Lowinger, JakeLowingerJakeLowinger, Jake", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1964251431 , 46645891 , 66569 , 9781109577914 , 3392335 , 3392335", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304914807?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0335 European history , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," European history , Labor relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , Economic reform , Ethnic war , Labor unrest , Nineteen 80s , Polanyi, Karl , Restructuring , Yugoslavia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Economic+reform+and+the+%E2%80%98double+movement%E2%80%99+in+Yugoslavia%3A+An+analysis+of+labor+unrest+and+ethno-nationalism+in+the+1980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lowinger%2C+Jake&amp;isbn=9781109577914&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.327835544,0.950117617,3682,Left,labor, trade unions in China,On collective agreement legal system: a perspective study on the general principle of collective agreement and its trend in China,"The purpose of this dissertation is to clarify the misunderstanding on collective agreement, to probe the theory on collective agreement , and to discuss the trend of collective agreement by a perspective study. The methods of comparison, history and class analysis are adopted for the study on the subject to illustrate that the collective agreement plays the most essential and important role in adjusting the labour relation. After the China's entry of WTO, collective agreement will hold the leading position for the employees to protect their rights. Compared with several definitions of collective agreement, collective agreement can be defined as an agreement in written reached between the trade union or the representative of employees and the employer or employers union concerning employment and labour condition , the collective bargain and enterprise management. This definition revises and develops the definition of collective agreement stipulated in the Chinese present regulation and the international labour standard. In attempting to make a clear distinction between the collective agreement and the civil contract, the author makes a study on the relation between the labour law and the civil lawï¼Œeconomic law. The collective agreement should not be treated as one of civil contracts and does not apply to the contract law. Labour law is the proper law of collective agreement. After the perspective study on the distinction between the collective agreement and the labour contract, the author does not regard the labour contract as an essential tool for the settlement on labour problem, but the collective agreement as a basic and widely applicable labour system embodied the labour law spirit. The state should make the law for the collective agreement as soon as possible. The general principle behind the collective agreement is discussed in this dissertation. Profit-Interest-Sharing theory(PIS) is proposed after the study and comment on the theories in the past. PIS should be applied in the total process of the collective agreement as the basic theory of collective agreement and is one of the basic rules of collective agreement including the signification, performance and termination. The author criticizes the traditional corporate profit-sharing system, management system, decision-making system which neglect the employees` interest. The employees should participate in the director board, supervisor board or the process of decision-making by the collective agreement with the help of the trade union. Collective Agreement cannot be separate from the collective bargaining and the dispute settlement .The dissertation emphases on the process of collective bargaining and proposes that the law should regulate the process of collective bargaining and the industrial action, such as strike, slowdown and lockouts caused by the failure of bargaining in order to reduce the social disorder. Collective agreement dispute settlement occurred between the two unions will be more rational than the labour contract dispute settlement between the individual employee and the employer. The trade union should be engaged in the dispute settlement between the individual employee and the employer by the collective agreement. It is a great help to solve the problem of the labour disputes rising in a large-scale. The development of collective agreement in china is affected by two elements: one is the economic elements of Chinese firms, another is globalization. The relation between WTO and labour problem is discussed to illustrate the trade and employment. The author demonstrates that we should concern about the anti-WTO movement and the social clause by America in thought of Chinese national interest protection. The initiation and development of collective agreement should be the first task for china after the entry of WTO.",1027896594, è®ºé›†ä½“åˆåŒæ³•å¾‹åˆ¶åº¦â€”â€”é›†ä½“åˆåŒæ³•ä¸€èˆ¬ç†è®ºåŠåœ¨ä¸­å›½å‘å±•è¶‹åŠ¿ç ”ç©¶,Dissertations & Theses," Jiang, Lu JunJiangJunLuJiang, Lu Junå§œä¿Šç¦„", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721112571 , 70366292 , 189128 , H013560 , H013560", Dissertation/Thesis,2002,, Chinese, Chinese, è®ºé›†ä½“åˆåŒæ³•å¾‹åˆ¶åº¦â€”â€”é›†ä½“åˆåŒæ³•ä¸€èˆ¬ç†è®ºåŠåœ¨ä¸­å›½å‘å±•è¶‹åŠ¿ç ”ç©¶,2002,PQDT - Global,2002,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027896594?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIH013560 , Social sciences , åˆ©ç›Šå…±äº« , è‡ªç”±è¯ , é›†ä½“äº‰è®® , é›†ä½“åˆåŒ , é›†ä½“è°ˆåˆ¤",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+collective+agreement+legal+system%3A+a+perspective+study+on+the+general+principle+of+collective+agreement+and+its+trend+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2002-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jiang%2C+Lu+Jun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.0138898,0.94918717,249,Left,labor,trade unions in China,The trade union's participation in social security in china,"Translation from original language as provided by author At present, there are a number of international and domestic research on the theory of social security. However, there are very few studies on the trade union's participation in the social security system, especially on how the trade union practically engaging in the social security system. The right of social security is important to workers, and is also a crucial part in the trade union's work. China chooses to develop the market economic, which means the choice of market competition and related rules. China is a large country and the economic situation is deferent from area to area, and the urban-rural dual structure is difficult to change in a short term, which in turn influence how the trade union enroll into the social security system. What is more, as a product of labor relationship, trade union should take on the responsibility of social security and safeguard workers' rights. Therefore, it makes sense to in-depth analyze how can the trade union participate in the work of social security, combine with the discussion of the special situation in China. The paper made a review on both international and domestic researches on trade union's participation in social security. And based on the development of social security in China, historically analyzed the status and functions of trade union in social security, especially in social insurance. In the early stage, trade union directly managed the social security system, but because of the Cultural Revolution and reform and opening up, trade union gradually step down in the management of social insurance. I analyzed the necessities of trade union's role and involvement from different aspects. First of all, trade union is the organization of workers, by nature it should protect workers' rights. And the right to social security is an important part in workers' rights, it is trade union's social responsibility to improve and protect workers' right to social security. The history of the development of trade union is the history that workers union together and fight for their own rights, including the right to social security. And the development of social security is closely related to the development of workers movement and trade union organizations. From both international and domestic perspectives, the trend of globalization, economic crisis, and the increase of labor disputes, all express a need that the trade union should play a role in maintaining harmonious labor relations and social stability. Take the trade union in Shanghai for example, as the development of market economic, trade union became ""marginalized"" in the work of social security. But as the trade union became active in establishing an labor relations adjustment mechanism in Shanghai, and providing assistance to staff, it effectively promoted the development of social security. This paper also emphasized the restrictions that in trade union's participation in the work of social security. The role and status of trade union's participation in social security should be legalized. Trade union should be more active in promoting the establishment of social security laws. And trade union's work method should be developed as society has been changed. All the restrictions mentioned above are due to the trade union's dependent to enterprises, lack of funding and weak in the legal status. Then I discussed how the trade union in Russian and Austrian involved in the management of social security system, I also made recommendations on how trade union can move forward and engage in the work of social security. The characteristics of this research lie in: discussed the social security issue from a trade union's perspective, which is an important member of social security partners, and historical analyzed the change of trade union's role and status in social security. And in depth analyzed why the trade union should participate in the work of social security.

These forms include the international agreements of the World Trade Organisation, the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum the International Monetary Fund and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. The study traces broad comparative themes in the development of supranational institutions and agreements and in the responses of unions to them. The neo-liberal restructuring of states and the internationalisation of some of their functions followed the economic crises of the nineteen seventies in the context of the growth in size and influence of transnational corporations. Neo-liberalism establishes favourable conditions for investment and profitability at the expense of labour rights and the social safety nets of the welfare state. National governments negotiate international agreements and are accountable to national constituencies. There is a growing crisis of legitimacy of supranational agreements negotiated without democratic accountability. Unions have been weakened by the internationalisation of production and the labour market deregulation which has accompanied it. International union organisations have sought, representation in the supranational organisations and have sought labour rights clauses in international agreements. This has achieved only limited success. Some unions have resisted aspects of international agreements in the nineteen nineties. Resistance by unions and social movements contributed to the collapse of the negotiations an the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. Effective union organisation in this context has been based independent unions with strong organisation in the workplace and alliances with other social movements at the local and national levels. The most successful responses to international institutions have built on this form of social movement unionism. These responses have included cross-border links between unions and cross-border links between, unions and social movements, using networking forms of communication through the internet.",304659878,,Dissertations & Theses," Ranald, Patricia MarieRanaldMariePatriciaRanald, Patricia Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 728431841 , 32231371 , 66569 , 0802269 , 0802269", Dissertation/Thesis,2000,, English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304659878?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations"," International law , International relations , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Internationalising , Solidarities , Supranational institutions , Unions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Developing+new+solidarities%3A++Unions+and+the+internationalising+state&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ranald%2C+Patricia+Marie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.878821103,0.946420233,2709,Left,labor,International Labour Organization,"The genesis of the International Labour Organization and international regime theory: Labour and social justice, social movements and ideas","This study examines the immediate causes of the International Labour Organization's creation in 1919. While the root cause of all the variables isolated may be attributed to World War I, there were other immediate causal factors in the ILO's establishment. The ILO provides an excellent historical case study of the conditions necessary for the formation of an international regime or organization. The gap that this study fills is the examination of two immediate factors, the rise in influence of organized labour movements and the transition of social justice as an underlying idea to the liberal mainstream, as necessary conditions in the successful creation of the ILO in 1919. The theoretical basis of this study rests upon international regime theory and uses Gail Osherenko and Oran R. Young's framework articulated in the introductory chapter of Polar Politics. This study particularly explores the role of ideas in the creation of international regimes or organizations. The organized labour movement was a champion of the idea of social justice and it had an influential position in society in 1919. Consequently governments could not ignore the demands of labour to establish international institutions based upon social justice. The case of the ILO suggests that underlying ideas may be the key component to the formation of new international regimes. But the idea requires a champion to be translated into action. The case of the International Labour Organization demonstrated the necessary conditions for international regime formation and it is a case which remains relevant today.",304403008,,Dissertations & Theses," Coombs, Sarah ElizabethCoombsElizabethSarahCoombs, Sarah Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 738200171 , 26984101 , 66569 , 0612210405 , 9780612210400 , MQ21040 , MQ21040", Dissertation/Thesis,1997," 0612210405 , 9780612210400", English, English,,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304403008?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations , 0582 History"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations , 0582 History"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations , 0582 History",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0629 Labor relations , 0582 History"," International law , International relations , Labor relations , History", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+genesis+of+the+International+Labour+Organization+and+international+regime+theory%3A+Labour+and+social+justice%2C+social+movements+and+ideas&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Coombs%2C+Sarah+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=0612210405&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.735419532,0.93310271,3606,Left,labor,farm workers in South Africa,A critical assessment of the labour law position of farm workers in South Africa,"The aim of this thesis is to investigate the labour law position of South African farm workers. For three and a half centuries farm workers constituted the most neglected group in the South African labour force). Consequently, an understanding of their present position can only be obtained by investigating their labour history. As in other parts of the world, farm workers in South Africa held a subordinate position to agricultural employers. Discrimination against black persons added to the inferior socio-economic and political position of South African farm workers. White farmers occupied a strong political position during most of the time under investigation, which enabled them to institute and apply discriminatory legislation and informal methods to overcome labour shortages. The freedom of movement of black people and their access to land were restricted to create a cheap immobile labour force. During the 20th century farmers prevented the inclusion of farm workers in labour legislation by exercising their political influence. Pressure by industrial trade unions and encouragement by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) resulted in the adoption of the Agricultural Labour Act which made labour legislation applicable to farm workers, but precluded them from striking and made allowance for longer working hours than for industrial workers. The new political dispensation facilitated the inclusion of farm workers in general labour legislation without any discriminatory exceptions and land reform legislation now protects farm workers against arbitrary evictions. A bill of rights furthermore guarantees the rights of farm workers which were previously violated. It would superficially seem that farm workers' problems are something of the past. Farm workers, however, remain handicapped in exercising their new rights by historical factors and circumstances peculiar to the agricultural sector. Legal comparison with Ontario and California confirms that legislation alone is insufficient to empower farm workers. It is recommended that the government amend existing legislation to accommodate the special needs of farm workers and that relevant ILO conventions, especially Convention 141 of 1975, be ratified to, aid the development of unions for farm workers. This will contribute to the empowerment of and social justice for farm workers.",304548387,,Dissertations & Theses," Calitz, Karin BeatrixCalitzBeatrixKarinCalitz, Karin Beatrix", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 731777951 , 30153481 , 66569 , 0801184 , 0801184", Dissertation/Thesis,1999,, English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304548387?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations"," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations"," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations",," 0398 Law , 0629 Labor relations"," Law , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Farm workers , Labor law , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+critical+assessment+of+the+labour+law+position+of+farm+workers+in+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Calitz%2C+Karin+Beatrix&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.249541119,0.932539765,2597,Left,labor,international labor movement,With a cosmopolitan intent: The idea of the nation in the international labor movement,"This project elaborates the history of a political idea, the nation, through the work of some of the most influential thinkers of the international labor movement between the mid-nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries. It argues against both those who maintain that the radical tradition has ignored and underestimated nationalism and those who accuse it of economic reductionism. What previous approaches to this topic miss is first that these thinkers aimed to organize workers in terms of shared class interests and in direct opposition to those who would promote particularist political and cultural goals. Second, that they were very much aware of the attractiveness of nationalist claims and sought both to understand and to counter them. And, finally, that it was only through the analysis of social structures that they could arrive at understandings of the nation which permitted the formulation of a vision capable of contesting capitalist expansion from the standpoint of universal freedom rather than nationalist revindication. In fact, it was precisely in those instances where the movement turned to the construction of national identities and cultures, by linking socialism to nation-building, that it went wrong. This study is organized around a selection of thinkers from each of the three Internationals. It seeks to reconstruct themes and to point out the historical and theoretical limitations of each problematique and each thinker. The latter include Bakunin, Marx, and Engels in relation to the First International's concern with class solidarity across political borders; Lenin, Luxemburg, and Bauer in relation to the Second International's concern with socialism in ethnically plural societies; Stalin and Gramsci in relation to the Third International's substitution of nation-building and national liberation for the old class project.

Instead of increasing cross-national uniformity and the development of formal civil and political organizations, international interdependence has been accompanied by the rise of a plethora of ascriptive-based groups. Not only has social science made little headway in explaining this general phenomenon, but the mapping of micro-mechanisms through which ascriptive allegiances are generated is lacking. This dissertation makes the following three arguments, based on over 200 interviews, surveys, and ethnographic data from Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. First, concrete and identifiable causal links exist between economic liberalization and the rise of identity-based politics, even where these are mediated by the unintended institutional consequences of liberalization. Second, the specific form taken by identity-based movements is related to the production profile, which is often subjected to new challenges as a result of economic liberalization. Third, contemporary identity-based movements are not throwbacks to prior cultural constructs, but are actively created economic, political, and ideational templates for coping with the new and radically transformed economic reality. Whereas religious-based movements have often been studied, the outcome I seek to explain in Jordan is the rapid and dramatic rise of formalized kinship institutions in the wake of economic liberalization. Between 1989 and 1999, over 400 family associations were established in a population of less than six million. Unlike â€œtraditionalâ€ Arab family structures with which they are often confused, these institutions are organizationally, spatially, and compositionally distinct from previously existing kin groups. Using in-depth ethnographic material, interviews, and administrative files, I argue that identity politics took this form in Jordan for several reasons. The demise of state welfare services, combined with economic hardships caused by liberalization and the regional recession, produced a need and opportunity for new types of economic services and labor market connections. Employment contacts, integral to organizational success in this context, can best be provided by cross-class kinship institutions due to the nature of Jordan's service-based economy. Further, the form of kinship used in these associations varies with the labor market and welfare opportunities of the family.",305343150,,Dissertations & Theses," Baylouny, Anne MarieBaylounyMarieAnneBaylouny, Anne Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765342841 , 30181851 , 66569 , 3121396 , 3121396", Dissertation/Thesis,2003,, English, English,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305343150?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0615 Political science , 0630 Welfare , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Political science , Welfare , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology"," Social sciences , Families , Jordan , Privatizing , Social provision , Welfare",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privatizing+welfare%2C+creating+families%3A++The+politics+of+social+provision+in+Jordan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baylouny%2C+Anne+Marie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.570495737,0.929150251,3739,Left,labor, labour-movement in Sweden,"Potatisriket: Stora Bjurum 1857â€“1917 Jorden, makten samhÃ¤llet","To the people on Sweden's big landed estates, the period 1857â€“1917 was an epoch of changes. The first two decades were in many ways a golden age for the landlords. Agricultural prices were high, wages low, and formal and informal political power still directly related to the land ownership. After 1880 these conditions rapidly changed. Grain prices fell due to increased international competition. Wages rose due to emigration and industrialisation. The democratisation process soon threatened the landowners politically. After the turn of the century, the growing labour-movement questioned their legitimacy and called for expropriating the big estates and redistributing the land. The present thesis deals with one Swedish estate-community during this period: Stora Bjurum in west-central Sweden. The goal is to offer an in-depth study over a limited area, covering a wide range of issues: geographic conditions, production, organisation of labour, social structure and local culture. The focus, however, is on political development. How does a community work where one person has virtually all means of power? How did the master use power and for what purposes? What could the apparently so powerless subjects do to assert themselves and their interests? How did all this change during the eventful period 1857â€“1917? A key concept in the study on inegalitarian societies is paternalism . This thesis elaborates a model to analyze the political mechanism of paternalistic community from the tensions between power and counter power, solidarity and conflict , and omnipotence and righteousness . It also shows how the masters' use of power changed over the time studied. Confronted with a harder competition of labour and the spread of ideas about democracy and social equality, the harsh and omnipotent rule of the early period no longer worked. The master now searched more to integrate the workers within the estate community. He also increasingly legitimized his own power through a paternalistic ideology stressing the good and mutual relationships between ruler and ruled. The subjects, however, also used this ideology, turning their masters' claims of righteousness into their own demands for better working conditions. This way, under the surface of a maintained monopoly of power, the subjects gradually strengthened their position.",305244836,,Dissertations & Theses," Nystrom, Lars VidorNystromVidorLarsNystrom, Lars Vidor", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 764609501 , 29924871 , 66569 , 9789188614438 , 9188614433 , C812238 , C812238", Dissertation/Thesis,2003," 9789188614438 , 9188614433", Swedish, Swedish,,2003,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2003,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305244836?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics"," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics"," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics",," 0615 Political science , 0335 European history , 0510 Labor economics"," Political science , European history , Labor economics"," Social sciences , Community , Farm mechanisation , Labour movement , Land , Paternalism , Power , Stora Bjurum Estate , Sweden",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Potatisriket%3A++Stora+Bjurum+1857%E2%80%931917+Jorden%2C+makten%0Asamh%C3%A4llet&amp;issn=&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nystrom%2C+Lars+Vidor&amp;isbn=9789188614438&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.162431914,0.911836995,1169,Left,labor,labor policy in newly democratized states,Labor policy in new democracies,"How do governments in newly democratized states treat civil society actors that helped to usher out the previous authoritarian regime? Do they reward them with economic rents through policies that are favorable to those actors? Or are these actors ignored in the policy debate following transition? This study focuses on the case of organized labor, a civil society actor with broadly universal policy interests, which tends to play a significant role in both the transition process under autocratic regimes and in the policymaking process under democratic regimes. It examines the correlation of democratization with subsequent labor policy, controlling for lagged effects of pre-transition union activity, trade openness, and workforce professionalization, to determine whether organized labor tends to have greater leverage in influencing labor policy in newly democratized countries than in established democracies. Regression models show that recent democratization has a positive correlation with most measures of labor-friendly policy.

The study highlights the contradictory trends of diversity and convergence at the workplace; the segmented nature of living spaces; a weakening of state-institutional linkages; and a dominant drift towards a de-politicised, enterprise-centric unionism: all reflexive of the marketing trends of globalisation.Â  At the same time, the thesis challenges the argument of uniform responses to globalisation and 'race to the bottom' in developing economies, specifically in production processes and management practices, as well as a uniformity in the impact on workers and responses or trade unions, specifically the decline of traditional trade unionism and the proposition that social movement unionism strengthens the trade union movement. The key findings indicate that there are significant differences in the labour management strategies and practices of the firms studied.Â  Differential practices lead to differential outcomes for the firms and workers.Â  Just as all firms do not respond in the same way to the pressures of global competition, workers and trade union responses vary too with varied outcomes for trade unions.Â  There is evidence of capacity of workers to exercise agency even in a constrained environment and significant differences in the forms and structures of trade unions.Â  Likewise, the responses towards and prospects for social movements vary that may be contextually determined with different, even opposing outcomes.",301675334,,Dissertations & Theses," Trivedi, AnitaTrivediAnitaTrivedi, Anita", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760726411 , 45122731 , 101309 , U218806 , U218806", Dissertation/Thesis,2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301675334?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0454 Management, Management," DXN101262 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Glbal+factory%2C+indian+worker&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Trivedi%2C+Anita&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.071141261,0.903542669,2391,Left,labor,Delaware labor leaders,The transformation of union-employer relations in the postwar era: An analysis of Delaware labor leaders,"Organized labor is under attack. As a result of the transfer of production to nonunionized work forces, vigorous management opposition, and the failure to organize white collar and service workers, the organized proportion of the American work force has dropped to less than one-fifth. As the quarter-century of postwar prosperity has given way to an era of increased international competition and a sluggish growth rate, employers have broken their old social contract with organized labor in which the acceptance of collective bargaining was traded for a stable work force. Because the union movement has been the only institution to continually represent the working class, its current weakness has caused concern. Aronowitz and other commentators have suggested that the labor movement could be revitalized by broadening its goals, pursuing class-based politics, and joining with other social movements to forge a new progressive coalition. To assess the possibility of revitalization on the local level, I examined the recent history of the Delaware labor movement through newspaper files and interviews and surveyed the local leaders. I looked for recent events which would indicate new activism and progress and focused on the ideological orientations of the local leaders that might facilitate or hinder the pursuit of class-based politics and the formation of progressive coalitions. I found that while Delaware has experienced most of the same problems as the labor movement nationally, local unions are pursuing new efforts to organize, the DuPont workers, once part of a system of paternalistic labor relations, have formed a new international and are becoming more active in their own interests, and new union-sponsored legislation to protect workers has been passed. The survey shows that the majority of leaders have a broad view of union goals, believe that unions should play a role in politics, and are willing to join in coalition with other local groups. Most identify themselves as moderates and the responses to various opinion questions do not represent a consistent ideology. Support for egalitarian change in the workplace and in society is strongly associated with both youth and higher education.",303671518,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, Marsha L.MillerL.MarshaMiller, Marsha L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 746615451 , 28502971 , 66569 , 9019722 , 9019722", Dissertation/Thesis,1989,, English, English,,1989,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/303671518?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+transformation+of+union-employer+relations+in+the+postwar+era%3A+An+analysis+of+Delaware+labor+leaders&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Marsha+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.540490451,0.90190378,2351,Left,labor,"Greece: labour struggles, the movement of the squares, demonstrations and riots","Surplus citizens: struggles in the greek crisis, 2010-2014","This thesis analyses the social struggles that occurred between 2010 and 2014 during the crisis in Greece: labour struggles, the movement of the squares, demonstrations and riots, neighbourhood assemblies, solidarity projects and economies, local environmental struggles, and anti-fascist and migrants' struggles. It discusses their internal and external limits in the historical specificity of the contemporary crisis and class relation. Drawing critically on ThÃ©orie Communiste's periodising schema, these struggles are framed, first, through a shift in the dynamic of the class relation effected by the crisis and the restructuring, which is a continuation of the first phase of 'neoliberal' restructuring in the 1990s. This shift intensified a central capitalist contradiction: while the capital relation imposes most violently the absolute dependence of subsistence on the wage, the wage relation fails to guarantee subsistence and integrates proletarians as surplus to capitalist reproduction. Second, the struggles are framed through the deep political crisis of state sovereignty and the relation between state and civil society, caused by the relentless imposition of the restructuring in conjunction with supranational institutions. These historical transformations are traced through the mutual constitution of international tendencies and the development of class struggle in Greece, against theories of dependency and underdevelopment. Ideological responses to the financial crisis and the logic of the restructuring are interrogated by employing theories of value, fetishism, and the state influenced by the German 'value-form' debate. Foucault-influenced conceptions of governmentality and sovereignty are also deployed to examine the restructuring's forms of imposition and the biopolitical crisis-management strategies of the state, which reinforced the racialised and gendered constitution of civil society. The thesis argues that these two elements, the changing dynamic of the class relation and the crisis of the state and civil society, defined the struggles of this period, in which two core characteristics can be identified. First, labour struggles confronted the dilemma between the necessity and inadequacy of the wage through an ambivalence between their attachment to work and their estrangement from it. This ambivalence did not question the terms of the dilemma posed, which were only questioned fleetingly in riots that interrupted the normality of commodity exchange. Second, the deep political crisis provoked struggles defending democracy, with the disempowered 'Greek citizen' as their central subject, which constitutively excluded migrants. The splitting of these struggles between leftwing anti-imperialist and rightwing anti-immigration nationalism, and into a struggle between fascism and anti-fascism, were not able to challenge this constitutive exclusion, which was only questioned by migrants' own struggles. Nationalism and the drive to reinforce unsettled social hierarchies played into the governmental effort to contain the political crisis, through the state's biopolitical management of the migrant and marginal, racialised and gendered surplus populations produced in the crisis.",1827522096,,Dissertations & Theses," Kotouza, DimitraKotouzaDimitraKotouza, Dimitra", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209465801 , 103716222 , 101309 , 10178303 , 10178303 , http://kar.kent.ac.uk/55614/", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827522096?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://kar.kent.ac.uk/55614/ , (UMI)AAI10178303 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Surplus+citizens%3A+struggles+in+the+greek+crisis%2C+2010-2014&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kotouza%2C+Dimitra&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.382006394,0.897643665,2652,Left,labor, the british labour movement 1884-1920,Theodore rothstein and the russian political emigre influence on the british labour movement 1884-1920,"This thesis examines the influence of Russian political emigrÃ©s on the British labour movement, 1884-1920, with particular reference to the career of Theodore Rothstein. It takes as its starting point Sergius Stepniak's comments on the impact of a small group of socialists on a Liberal- Radical demonstration in Hyde Park in 1884, and closes with the formation of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920 and the refusal to allow Th. Rothstein re-entry into Britain in August 1920. It takes issue with those historians who have argued that the Russian political emigrÃ© influence was essentially harmful, serving only to undermine natural developments already in evidence on the British Left and imposing new perspectives, which later made the CPGB subservient to the needs of Soviet foreign policy. This thesis, on the contrary, argues that the Russian political emigrÃ© community in Britain, predominantly Jewish, had become an integral part of the Left-wing of the British labour movement by the time of the formation of the CPGB, and as such formed part of the British socialist tradition that favoured Marxism. It looks specifically at the history of the Social-Democratic Federation, (SDF) which between 1884 and 1920 adopted the titles Social-Democratic Party and British Socialist Party before it merged itself with the CPGB in 1920. The SDF appealed particularly to the Russian political emigrÃ©s, as opposed to other groupings, because it saw itself as a Social-Democratic body and part of an international movement, to which the Russian Social- Democratic Labour Party was affiliated. The emigrÃ©s, therefore, felt that their activity within the British socialist movement was not something imposed upon a reluctant nativist body; but an integral part of that movement's development.",1817359160,,Dissertations & Theses," Burke, DavidBurkeDavidBurke, David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4172878091 , 107619522 , 101309 , U635185 , U635185 , http://gala.gre.ac.uk/6122/", Dissertation/Thesis,1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1817359160?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://gala.gre.ac.uk/6122/ , (UMI)AAIU635185 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Theodore+rothstein+and+the+russian+political+emigre+influence+on+the+british+labour+movement+1884-1920&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burke%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.037285051,0.995563717,2863,Left,LGBTQ,Asian and Pacific Islander queer women's and transgendered people's movement of San Francisco,Coming out together: An ethnohistory of the Asian and Pacific Islander queer women's and transgendered people's movement of San Francisco,"This is an ethnohistory of the Asian and Pacific Islander lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people's (APLBT) movement of San Francisco and its origins in the race, class, gender and sexuality conflicts of the social movements of the 1960s. This study is based on qualitative interviews of community activists and a critical review of historical documents of the Asian/Pacific Islander, African American, Latino, Native American and white civil rights, community empowerment, women's and queer movements. The early Civil Rights Movement and Gay Rights Movement were specifically examined for interpersonal race, class, gender and sexuality problems and how each movement challenged racism, sexism, heterosexism and homophobia in society. In particular, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a militant interracial youth organization in the South, was wracked with problematic internal organizational problems and interpersonal conflicts that readily fell along race, class, gender and sexuality fault lines. After repeated confrontations with racial violence and disillusionment with whites, liberalism and non-violence, SNCC advocated Black Power and separatism in 1966. Afterwards, the movements divided along racial lines, followed by further splits along gender and sexuality differences. On both sides of the racial divide, problems of racism, tokenism, misogyny and homophobia either alienated or outright excluded gay people of color as full citizens of these movements. A distinct gay people of color movement developed at the margins by the late 1970s. The APLBT movement emerged from within this broader gay people of color movement by the late 1980s. For the next ten years, the APLBT community focused internally to develop a network and movement that valued both gay and API identities and communities. San Francisco, which has large API and gay communities, was studied because of its historical role in building various pan-API and specific ethnic, language, age, sexual orientation and gender identity organizations at the local, national and international levels.",304584929,,Dissertations & Theses," Ordona, Trinity AnnOrdonaAnnTrinityOrdona, Trinity Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 727711101 , 31875541 , 66569 , 9780599856813 , 0599856815 , 9979937 , 9979937", Dissertation/Thesis,2000," 9780599856813 , 0599856815", English, English,,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2000,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304584929?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Asian and Pacific Islander , California , Ethnohistory , Queer women's and transgendered people's movement , San Francisco , Transgendered",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Coming+out+together%3A++An+ethnohistory+of+the+Asian+and+Pacific+Islander+queer+women%27s+and+transgendered+people%27s+movement+of+San+Francisco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ordona%2C+Trinity+Ann&amp;isbn=9780599856813&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.482949352,0.977527746,3334,Left,LGBTQ,LGBTQ movements in Brazil and Mexico,Refracted modernities: Homosexuality and party politics in Brazil and Mexico,"This dissertation examines the trajectory of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered) activism in Latin America's two largest formal democracies, Brazil and Mexico, specifically focusing on activists' alliances with political parties and engagement with legislatures. Underscoring variable national imprints on evolving transnational norms inscribing sexuality within a broader paradigm of liberal citizenship, the work can thus be framed as a study of variations on a transnational theme of liberal modernity that encompasses three levels of analysis. First, drawing on global culture theory, I trace the emergence of certain common trends in activists' relationships with political parties and legislatures over time, shaping both their priority demands of the state and the state's response to them. Second, against this backdrop, however, I note significant differences in Brazilian and Mexican activists' prevailing strategies in approaching the partisan arena, both in terms of the alliances they crafted and their discursive extensions, including the construction of collective political identities to advance their claims. To explore these differences, I draw on symbolic interactionism, focusing on the relationship between changing possibilities for representation, the institutionalization of party actors' audience calculations, and evolving discursive repertoires at the national and transnational levels. I argue that transnational liberal norms, while fostering common trends, have been variably refracted across national boundaries in multiple ways, shaped in part by the variable institutionalization of the audience costs that party actors attached to movement demands. Third, I argue that this reinscription of sexuality in the public sphere should itself be read critically, with attention to its embeddedness in society and its intersections with arrangements of power in the private sphere. Drawing on longstanding critiques of liberal citizenship, I thus argue that the transnational trends noted above have been variably refracted not only across national but also subnational boundaries like race, gender, region, and class. The dissertation is based on approximately 14 months of fieldwork in Brazil and Mexico, each.

This study focuses on three groundbreaking New York City groupsâ€”Gay Youth (GY), Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), and the Gay International Youth Society of George Washington High School (GWHS)â€”from the advent of gay liberation in NYC in 1969 to just after the dissolution of gay liberation and the rise of identity politics by 1975. These three groups are forerunners of more than two thousand present-day high school Gay-Straight Alliances and community-based programs. They were unique for their early dates of origin, youth activism and visibility, the range of identities (gender, sexual, racial, and ethnic), the extent of their activities (including publication, outreach, activism, organization) and the influences of gay liberation, the anti-war movement, feminism, Black liberation, Youth Liberation, high school rights movements, and the New Left. Gay Youth (GY) provided a social and political outlet for those under twenty-one. Established in 1970, it was initially one of many New York Gay Liberation Front cells. Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.) sheltered â€œthrow-awayâ€ homeless street youth, espoused free gender expression, an end to prison injustice, and the creation of an inclusive community that rejected binding definitions of gender and sexual identity. The Gay International Youth Society of George Washington High School was a gay-straight club established in December, 1972, with support from the Gay Activists Alliance. Surprisingly, it was formed seventeen years before the first officially recognized Gay-Straight Alliance. I investigate two key questions: (1)Â How did gay liberation (informed by other Movement struggles) catalyze young gay liberation activists? (2)Â Why did youth form and join groups distinct from adult homophile and gay liberation organizations and what did they derive from the experience? I ask how sexual ideology shaped membership criteria, patterns of organization, decision-making, the role of participants, and efforts to effect social change. These questions are also relevant to present-day educators and queer youth activists. As gay liberation ceded ground to the politics of mainstream assimilation, revolutionary gay liberation youth groups were gradually overshadowed by adult-led social service programs.",305193664,,Dissertations & Theses," Cohen, StephanCohenStephanCohen, Stephan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 795941471 , 31899591 , 66569 , 9780496080175 , 0496080172 , 3148711 , 3148711", Dissertation/Thesis,2004," 9780496080175 , 0496080172", English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305193664?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0582 History , 0998 Educational theory"," 0520 Education history , 0582 History , 0998 Educational theory"," 0520 Education history , 0582 History , 0998 Educational theory",," 0520 Education history , 0582 History , 0998 Educational theory"," Education history , History , Educational theory"," Social sciences , Education , Army , Gay liberation , New York City , Youth groups",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+historical+investigation+of+school+and+community-based+gay+liberation+youth+groups%2C+New+York+City%2C+1969%E2%80%931975%3A++%E2%80%9CAn+army+of%0Alovers+cannot+fail%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cohen%2C+Stephan&amp;isbn=9780496080175&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.083684645,0.904325696,180,Left,LGBTQ,tongzhi (gay and lesbian) movement in Taiwan,"Disrupting boundaries of desire: Gender, sexuality, and globalization in Tsai Ming -liang's cinema of the oppressed","This dissertation explores the representation of gender, sexuality, and globalization in Tsai Ming-liang's films. Not only does it provide a close reading of Tsai's eight feature-length films, but it also situates his films in the context of Taiwan New Cinema as well as the rise of tongzhi (gay and lesbian) movement in Taiwan. In contrast to the films made by other Taiwan New Cinema directors, Tsai's films conjure up a unique minimalist and diasporic aesthetic that draws scrupulous attention to the critical aspects of gender, sexuality, and transnational cultural flows in Taiwan and abroad. Nevertheless, his films do not portray (homo) sexuality as innate and natural, nor do they embrace the kind of visibility and identity politics that the mainstream tongzhi movement advocates. Instead, his films illustrate how genders and sexualities are multiple, changeable, performative, and interconnected with a wide range of other social identities and power relations. The introduction begins with a brief literature review of feminist and queer discourses, and then provides a general overview of Taiwan New Cinema and Taiwan's tongzhi movement. It investigates the intertwined relationships between Tsai's Malaysian-Chinese background, his ambiguous sexuality, his success in the international film circuit, and the major characteristics of his eight feature films. Chapter One looks into Tsai's first two features, Rebels of the Neon God (1992) and Vive L'Amour (1994) to rethink the advance of gendered globalization in enhancing the individual's sexual mobility and unshackling the grip of the traditional family. Chapter Two offers a queer reading of The River (1997) and Goodbye Dragon Inn (2003) to visualize the invisible heteronormativity in Taiwanese society. Chapter Three examines how Tsai uses the paradigm of upstairs and downstairs and the seven-hour difference between Paris and Taipei to allegorize and undo gender hierarchy in The Hole (1998) and What Time Is It There? (2001). Chapter Four investigates the ways in which the figure of the stranger is used to envision a shared marginality in The Wayward Cloud (2005) and I Don't Want to Sleep Alone (2006). The conclusion would further conceptualize the disruptive and empowering implications of strangers in Tsai's films.",304473547,,Dissertations & Theses," Chang, Kai-manChangKai-manChang, Kai-man", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1674956191 , 40512451 , 66569 , 9781109003475 , 3344300 , 3344300", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304473547?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies",," 0305 Asian literature , 0900 Film studies"," Asian literature , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , China , Gender , Globalization , Queer , Sexuality , Taiwan New Cinema , Tsai, Ming-liang",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Disrupting+boundaries+of+desire%3A+Gender%2C+sexuality%2C+and+globalization+in+Tsai+Ming+-liang%27s+cinema+of+the+oppressed&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chang%2C+Kai-man&amp;isbn=9781109003475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.377288193,0.903442669,382,Left,LGBTQ,political struggles around decriminalization of homosexuality and sex work in contemporary India,"Governing sexualities: Globalization, biopower, and citizenship in postcolonial India","This dissertation compares the political struggles around decriminalization of homosexuality and sex work in contemporary India. Since the mid-1990s the Indian state and national and international NGOs have been mobilizing sex workers and gay populations for HIV/AIDS prevention work in India. I asks two primary questions: First, how do the legal and political challenges around sex work and homosexuality become articulated in the face of local needs and practices and transnational concern about HIV/AIDS; and second, what do these challenges reveal about state power over how human bodies are used in a postcolonial context and about the connections between sexuality and modernity. I draw on Foucault's concept of biopowerâ€”the surveillance, control, and management of populationsâ€”to analyze what happens as these groups become part of transnational health projects for the first time, and how these projects transform the relationship between the state and sexually marginalized communities into one in which they have more opportunity to assert themselves as rights-bearing actors. I also show how state agencies find themselves competing among themselves in their relationships to these groups. The Indian state both needs to work with these groups to prevent HIV/AIDS but also to impose the criminal sanctions on homosexuality and sex work mandated by law. I pay particular attention to these disjunctures within the state, and analyze how they do or do not enable these groups to resist stigma and discrimination and demand formal legal rights from the Indian state. Despite the engagement of transnational actors and local social movements, I find that the demands for inclusion of marginalized communities are not always external to the state. Transnational groups, the state and the movements are co-constituting the politics of rights on the ground.",821684368,,Dissertations & Theses," Lakkimsetti, ChaitanyaLakkimsettiChaitanyaLakkimsetti, Chaitanya", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2219600271 , 54741861 , 66569 , 9781124363882 , 3437047 , 3437047", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,9.78E+12, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/821684368?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , GLBT Studies , South Asian Studies , Social structure , Comparative analysis , Globalization , Citizenship , Colonialism , Politics , Homosexuality , Prostitution , Human immunodeficiency virus--HIV , Acquired immune deficiency syndrome--AIDS , Nongovernmental organizations--NGOs , Sexuality , India"," Social sciences , Biopower , Globalization , Homosexuality , India , Postcolonial , Sex work , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Governing+sexualities%3A+Globalization%2C+biopower%2C+and+citizenship+in+postcolonial+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lakkimsetti%2C+Chaitanya&amp;isbn=9781124363882&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.024868007,0.925420699,721,Right,libertarianism,millenial libertarians in the US,Millennial libertarians: The rebirth of a movement and the transformation of U.S. political culture,"This dissertation examines the contemporary resurgence of libertarianism in the U.S., exploring a rapidly expanding, transnational network of hundreds of thousands liberty movement participants connected through student groups, community organizations, and established institutions, as well as through social media and a vast array of online forums. Grounded in 32 months of ethnographic fieldwork and over 200 interviews, it documents the rise of a profound disenchantment, particularly among millennials, with state-based solutions to pressing contemporary problems and, more broadly, with the nation-state project itself. Drawing on first-hand accounts ranging from elite boardrooms and think tank conference rooms, to political demonstrations and direct actions, to student reading groups and gatherings of cryptoanarchist communities, the dissertation situates the ethnographic study within the broader framework of a reconfiguration of U.S. populism in the era of the security state. The project examines how established libertarian organizations, a key component of the longstanding U.S. conservative coalition, have helped infuse libertarianism with renewed relevance for a substantial part of an entire generation deeply disheartened by a world embroiled in economic crisis and heavily militarized systems of governance. Through the consolidation of a libertarian wing of the Republican Party, parts of the liberty movement are presently shaking up the very conservative coalition that helped usher forth the movement's revival. But libertarianism's resurgence is also powerfully reshaping U.S. political culture beyond formal political processes, giving rise to a proliferation of libertarian spaces that expressly reject effecting change through electoral politics and policy in favor of changing ""hearts and minds"" by promoting libertarian principles and social organization. Simultaneously, growing numbers of millennials influenced by the liberty movement increasingly challenge its dominant trends, focusing on the experiences of vulnerable and marginalized groups â€” from urging the integration of libertarianism with a broader socioeconomic critique as well as antiracism, feminism, mutual aid, and labor solidarity, to revisiting the ideas of 19th century U.S. individualist anarchists. Thus, while the libertarian political establishment is likely to continue to expand over the coming years and secure a firmer place in the Republican Party, the movement simultaneously serves as a siphon â€” growing numbers of millennial libertarians are presently breaking from the political right and moving closer to various forms of left libertarianism, market anarchism, mutualism, and even social anarchism. The project thus illustrates the centrality of cultural formations beyond policy and electoral politics to the largest popular movement motivated by distinctly libertarian ideas in the postwar period, as well as to reconfigurations of U.S. liberalism. The dissertation contributes to a burgeoning literature on the resurgence of antistatist theory and organizing in the new millennium. Scholars and activists alike continue to document especially the revitalization of social anarchist traditions permeating numerous contemporary struggles, tracing how the resuscitation of social anarchist thought and activism informs important parts of extant insurgency across the globe. The U.S. liberty movement presents another key but understudied aspect of the present antistate moment. The dissertation also builds on longstanding anthropological approaches to understanding the complex processes through which political ideologies are shaped and constituted. Through an ethnographic lens, it interrogates how deeply ingrained U.S. ideologies of freedom, individualism, and even liberalism itself are interpreted, contested, and reappropriated to both challenge and reinscribe relations of power. The libertarian resurgence represents a crucial struggle over the very meaning and direction of U.S. liberalism in our historical moment.",1641125625,,Dissertations & Theses," Tretjak, KajaTretjakKajaTretjak, Kaja", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3540996781 , 86133072 , 66569 , 9781321288193 , 3642162 , 3642162", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1641125625?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," American studies , Cultural anthropology"," Social sciences , Anarchism , Conservatism , Libertarianism , Populism , Social movements , U.s. politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Millennial+libertarians%3A+The+rebirth+of+a+movement+and+the+transformation+of+U.S.+political+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tretjak%2C+Kaja&amp;isbn=9781321288193&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.356097966,0.909225222,3258,Left,nationalism,"Armenian self -determination movement; ""truly progressive nationalism in an era of global restructurin""","We are our mountains: Geographies of nationalism in the Armenian self -determination movement, Nagorno -Karabakh","Here I tell the story of the Armenian movement for self-determination in Nagorno-Karabakh, tracing its development from initial popular uprisings of 1988 until the attainment of de facto independence and postwar stabilization in the mid-1990s. My main focus is on national consciousness: how it becomes framed and reframed during the course of struggle, and how it may help or hinder the development of a genuinely emancipatory politics. In developing my argument, I explore especially the roles of space, gender, and nature as constitutive elements of the national mobilization process. These explorations, in turn, connect to larger theoretical treatments of nationalism, colonialism, and national liberation movements. In particular, I seek to critique and expand upon (1)Â national liberationist theories produced by Cabral, Fanon, and others who have sought to place nationalism in collaborative tension with a radical, anti-imperialist politics; and (2)Â theories of nationalism regarding the former Soviet Union, which have only recently begun to engage with the purview and concerns of critical social theory. In performing these operations, I also seek to provide critical reflection upon the Karabakh self-determination movement; its failures, limitations, as well as accomplishments to date; its possible future trajectories; and most broadly, the prospects for a truly progressive nationalism in an era of global restructuring. Although 1988 is usually cited as the Karabakh movement's starting point, there can be no doubt that prior processes contributed greatly to the form and content of later upheavals. Accordingly, I examine (1)Â Karabakh's historical geography under Soviet-Azerbaijani rule (1923â€“1987); and (2)Â the circumstances leading up to Karabakh's initial incorporation into Azerbaijan (pre-1923). In the first exercise, I discover that Karabakh's underdevelopment contributed to the escalation of ethnic tensions, as discriminatory redistribution, cultural-economic stagnation, and overt ethnic oppression became increasingly intense and far-reaching under Baku. The second exercise provides early background to the ethnic conflict, focusing especially on the first two decades of the 20 th century, when escalating tensions hardened into open hostilities between Armenians and Azerbaijani Turks. These hostilitiesâ€”often stoked by Russian imperialismâ€”would set the stage for the contemporary struggle to inhabit and possess Karabakh.",305155147,,Dissertations & Theses," Kasbarian, John AntranigKasbarianAntranigJohnKasbarian, John Antranig", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 765208601 , 19295181 , 66569 , 3117612 , 3117612", Dissertation/Thesis,2004,, English, English,,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2004,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305155147?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science"," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science"," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science",," 0366 Geography , 0615 Political science"," Geography , Political science"," Social sciences , Armenian , Nagorno-Karabakh , Nationalism , Self-determination movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+are+our+mountains%3A++Geographies+of+nationalism+in+the+Armenian+self+-determination+movement%2C+Nagorno+-Karabakh&amp;issn=&amp;date=2004-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kasbarian%2C+John+Antranig&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.798120427,0.932479338,2939,Mixed,nationalism,"largely Protestant, Unionist majority and the mostly Catholic, Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland","The reform -conflict paradox in Northern Ireland, 1963â€“1972: Constitutional logic and transnational dimensions of ethnic political contention","Ironically, efforts to promote social equality in ethnically divided societies have resulted in armed conflicts while armed conflicts have given rise to the pursuit of social equality. Two factors explain this paradoxical relationship. First, actors commonly view social equality and constitutional change as two sides of the same coin. Second, shifts in national and transnational level processes generally interact with ethnic contention in ways that expand the scope of policy reforms and heighten levels of political violence. Using archival searches, interviews of key informants, and a protest event database, I examine relations between the largely Protestant, Unionist majority and the mostly Catholic, Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland. The prospect of ending the partition of Ireland motivated several activists playing key roles in the formation of a civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. Mass mobilization in the later part of the 1960s triggered a backlash by Unionists concerned about the constitutional implications of civil rights demands. Reforms enacted by the Northern Ireland state increased violence by militant Unionists. In the face of repression and vigilante attacks, a large section of the Nationalist population revolted in the pursuit of a united Ireland in the early 1970s. Intense, prolonged political violence subsequently encouraged initiatives aimed at accommodating Nationalists. The ability of activists to create pressure on behalf of civil rights demands depended upon the resources, organizational capacities, inter-organizational dynamics, political opportunities, collective action frames, and forms of contention of rival transnational networks of organizations with competing policy agendas. While researches have emphasized factors internal to Northern Ireland, shifts in external factors also significantly affected the trajectory and policy consequences of civil rights contention. Changes in: (1)Â the levels and dynamics of transnational mobilization; (2)Â international media coverage of contention; and (3)Â relations between states, initially promoted reforms but subsequently undermined efforts to sustain policy progress, to prevent rebellion in the face of violent opposition, and to restrain counter-insurgency measures. Insights gained by focusing upon the dynamics and transnational dimensions of ethnic issue contention point towards the need for analytical reorientation and conceptual retooling within the fields of ethnic studies and social movements research.",250065241,,Dissertations & Theses," Maney, Gregory MichaelManeyMichaelGregoryManey, Gregory Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 725901321 , 27764761 , 66569 , 0493323198 , 9780493323190 , 3020695 , 3020695", Dissertation/Thesis,2001," 0493323198 , 9780493323190", English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250065241?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0700 Social structure , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Social structure , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Constitutional logic , Ethnic conflict , Northern Ireland , Reform-conflict paradox , Transnational mobilization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+reform+-conflict+paradox+in+Northern+Ireland%2C+1963%E2%80%931972%3A++Constitutional+logic+and+transnational+dimensions+of+ethnic+political+contention&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maney%2C+Gregory+Michael&amp;isbn=0493323198&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.836651346,0.915004762,1094,Mixed,nationalism,nationalist social movements in Yugoslavia (1992-1995),Micropolitics of transition in Yugoslavia: A local and a global demise,"The thesis provides a cultural analysis on the micropolitics of Yugoslavia wars in 1992-1995, examining local and global media coverage along with grassroots and historical dimensions.

What historians have largely failed to note is the integral nature of dance, in particular the longways English country form, to the realm of politics and the formation of national identity. From the earliest days of its dissemination in print, English country dance served a political purpose. In 1651, under Oliver Cromwellâ€™s dour Protectorate government, Royalists like publisher John Playford used dance as a subtle form of resistance. Urging the public to remember the monarchy fondly and to join together in a quintessentially English pastime, Playfordâ€™s English Dancing Master created an imagined community of political dissenters. The Playford manuals set the standard for the politicization of dance in Anglo culture, both in the politically-charged dance titles they contained and in the intended function of dance performance itself. This awareness of danceâ€™s potential and the tendency to employ it for political ends were carried across the Atlantic to Englandâ€™s North American colonies. In the years preceding the American Revolution, as well as during the war itself, the ballroom became a political space to a heightened degree. While minuets established a clear social hierarchy, country dances broke it down into more democratic forms. Codes of conduct at assemblies allowed attendees (especially women) to publicize their political allegiances through their dress, behavior, and dance selection. Both the British and the Americans, up and down the eastern seaboard, sought to turn the politicization of the ballroom to their advantage; spectacular fetes such as Howe's Mischianza won local populations to the British cause, while the Philadelphia Assembly prohibited Loyalists from subscribing to its events. Partially in response to British extravagance, the Continental Army characterized its festivities as orderly, economical, and virtuous. In the Federal era, political rivals again used dance as a form of propaganda, warring over the legacy of independence. International tensions ran high as France found itself embroiled in a bloody revolution that sent a new wave of emigres fleeing abroad. Many settled in the United States and often made a living teaching dance. Pro- and anti-French feeling spilled over into the ballroom. As the rise of the middle class rendered dance an understandable language across a wide swath of the voting population, two major themes arose: that of dance as a wholesome rustic activity in keeping with lauded classical virtues, and that of the social-leveling, chaotic frolic, imbibed with vice and dangerous Jacobin principles. An analysis of dance metaphors reveals growing discomfort with race relations and with the political aspirations of the lower classes, suggesting the gradual closure of the window of opportunity that independence had proffered. English country dance persisted into Jacksonian America, despite the rise of French cotillions and quadrilles.

And it was prevailled in China for more than twenty years. The main content includes the patriotic educational spirit of criticism of traditional education of liberal arts, the propaganda of military spirit, having reserve soldiers among the people, turnning the entire nation into soldiers. Militarism has been long endured in the Chinese nation as a convention. In the critical period of our nation, the advanced intellects realized the importance of militarism and the overall healthy quality of the entire people of our nation. As a reasult, they began to advocate the militarism education. It was analysed that the main reasons of the rising of militarism education are the influence of international militarism, social Darwinism, anti-russia movement. The advocation of peace also leads to the decline of militarism education. Under the visual field of trend of thought in militarism education, personages in all fields of society, especially for Kang Youwei, began to know the significance of Physical Education. In his educational thoughts, the three elements of the thoughts of military physical education for a prosperous country with a powerful army, the school physical education for ""moral, intellectual. and physical"" , and the feminine physical education constitute a creative, special physical ideological system. During the period of the end of Qing dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, our nation's society has changed fundamentally. Different classes in China introduced the thought of militarism education for different purposes. And they put all these thought into use in school physical education and formed the militarism school physical education with Chinese features, which is found to be the military exercises. It helped the social developments and promoted the process of standardization of our nation's school physical education, and established the fundation of physical education in our country's overall education initially. In further study, it was found that the trend of thought in militarism education has changed the traditional concept of despising physical education, spurred the changing of school education concepts, promoted the reforms in educational content and methods, enriched the content of school education, pushed forward the popularization of school physical",1870345888,,Dissertations & Theses," Qi, Jian MinQiMinJianQi, Jian Min", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315949281 , 111112692 , 189128 , 10434408 , 10434408", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870345888?accountid=14496, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history,, 0520 Education history, Education history," (UMI)AAI10434408 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trend+of+thought+in+militarismeducation+and+its+influence+on+school+physical+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Qi%2C+Jian+Min&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.374838348,0.94914048,3477,Right,nationalism,Canadian Television Network's (CTV) ,Olympic power plays: A social analysis of CTV's production of the 1988 Winter Olympic ice hockey tournament,"This dissertation is a study of the Canadian Television Network's (CTV) production of the 1988 Winter Olympic ice hockey tournament. A critical cultural studies analysis of the production site, the crew, Olympic and network decision makers is conducted on a number of levels including the political, economic and cultural spheres of broadcasting. On the broadest political-economic level, Olympic broadcasting is analyzed to question how Canada's national private network strategically employed Olympic hockey as a spectacle of accumulation to boost ratings, expand market positioning, strengthen their media monopoly, and attract national sponsors while blocking national broadcast competitors. To study the political-economic level, three methods are utilized including (1) interviews with network and Olympic officials, (2) document analysis of media and Olympic policies, papers, memos and texts, and (3) ethnographic observation of the media officials in the Broadcast Centre and at the SaddleDome hockey venue. Ethnographic observation of the labour process of the CTV hockey crew at the arena, informed by the semiotic insights of critical communication studies, provides the second level of understanding, Olympic broadcasting as a spectacle of legitimation. These observations illustrate how the crew re-make the live sporting event into a series of cultural images to ""sell"" the national audience. These images are compatible with the commercial and sporting ideologies of the ""Olympic family"" (including the International Olympic Committee, media rights holders and exclusive sponsors), and broadcasts that are compatible with mythologies of the unofficial Canadian ""national game"". The ethnographic elements of production appraised in this study include the division of media labour, crew relations, social-aesthetic use of broadcast technology, the conventional employment of sporting codes of commentary and visual codes of television mediation. Despite covering a losing Team Canada, which had been positioned as a medal hopeful by CTV programmers prior to the 1988 Games, this study demonstrates how the television crew laboured to reclaim hockey as ""the"" Canadian sport in order to reassert a self-proclaimed superiority in producing the television feed for all world broadcasters. The work to create Olympic telecast images of the sporting spectacle is revealed to be a social process that legitimates select systems of meaning, reinforces particular modes of media production and strengthens monopolistic political-economic relationships: the circuit of cultural production constructs a profoundly patriotic and patriarchal version of hockey that momentarily serves the economic and marketing interests of the CTV network and the Olympic movement, while reproducing the cultural-economic power of the National Hockey League as the hockey reference system for broadcasting spectacles of this game.",304158321,,Dissertations & Theses," MacNeill, Margaret E.MacNeillE.MargaretMacNeill, Margaret E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 741436371 , 28561861 , 66569 , 9780612011397 , 0612011399 , NN01139 , NN01139", Dissertation/Thesis,1994," 9780612011397 , 0612011399", English, English,,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1994,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304158321?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation"," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation"," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation",," 0708 Mass media , 0334 Canadian history , 0814 Recreation"," Mass media , Canadian history , Recreation"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Alberta , Canadian Television Network , Winter Olympics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Olympic+power+plays%3A+A+social+analysis+of+CTV%27s+production+of+the+1988+Winter+Olympic+ice+hockey+tournament&amp;issn=&amp;date=1994-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MacNeill%2C+Margaret+E.&amp;isbn=9780612011397&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.016899241,0.936632649,741,Right,nationalism,Qing self-strengthening and reform movements,Fin-de-SiÃ¨cle Diplomat: Chen Jitong (1852-1907) and Cosmopolitan Possibilities in the Late Qing World,"This dissertation explores Sino-Western interactions in the late Qing period through a biographical study of the diplomat-writer Chen Jitong (1852-1907). A flamboyant writer and self-appointed cultural mediator between China and France, Chen published, while serving as secretary in the Chinese legation in Paris in the 1880s, several books in French on Chinese culture and society. He also became a skilled public speaker at various learned societies and international congresses. In the last years of his life, Chen returned to China as a reformer, expectant official, and newspaper editor. With a colorful transnational life and career that was nevertheless heavily rooted in the late Qing self-strengthening and reform movements, Chen Jitong offers an exemplary case study for viability of late imperial Chinese literati culture in the modern world. Chapter 1 discusses the confluence of local literati culture and the opportunities opened for a generation of late-Qing cultural figures in the cosmopolitan environment surrounding the Fuzhou Navy Yard. Chapter 2 shows that in his writings, Chen employed an innovative mÃ©lange of classical Chinese texts and references to European literature to capture the uniqueness of Confucian values while also emphasizing the universality of human feelings and shared literary values. Chapter 3 analyzes the ways in which Chenâ€™s public activities constituted a significant discursive and personal presence for China in fin-de-siÃ¨cle Paris and at the 1889 Universal Expositions. Chapter 4 reconnects Chen to the late Qing milieu by retracing his involvement in a number of political and social projects upon his return to China. In mapping out Chen Jitongâ€™s experiences as a cultural mediator and as a literatus-reformer, this study seeks to connect the dots between various studies of late Qing industrialization, social activism, cultural innovation, and political reform. It demonstrates that on the international stage, late Qing diplomats were highly conscious of their position not only as representatives of the Qing polity, but as bearers of Chinese civilization. Chen Jitongâ€™s cross-cultural performance, in particular, is a reminder that the late nineteenth century was not only an age of imperialistic encroachment, but also a time of cosmopolitan encounters.",1859066326,,Dissertations & Theses," Ren, KeRenKeRen, Ke", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4303069341 , 110390522 , 66569 , 9781369476002 , 10302290 , 10302290", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1859066326?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history",," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," History , Modern history"," Social sciences , Cosmopolitanism , Jitong, Chen , Late qing dynasty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fin-de-Si%C3%A8cle+Diplomat%3A+Chen+Jitong+%281852-1907%29+and%0ACosmopolitan+Possibilities+in+the+Late+Qing+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ren%2C+Ke&amp;isbn=9781369476002&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.133593072,0.960927566,278,Right,nationalism,"radicalism, Americanism, and ethnocentrism and the Japanese diaspora in NYC","Nine clouds: A social history of New York City Nikkei, volume 1, 1900â€“1940","This work examines the question of why an ethnic Japanese community with identifiable physical boundaries did not form in New York City between the late 19th Century and 1940. The work contends that New Yorkâ€™s position as the American center of international trade, finance, and the literary and cultural arts attracted a diversity of highly-educated ethnic Japanese residents who formed five micro communities based upon a melding of Eastern and Western class and status concepts. The micro communities were part of a four-tiered social hierarchy and a separate student sphere. The class- and status-based community structure challenges the prevalent view that ethnicity and culture were the foremost factors in the formation and development of social relations within Issei and Nisei communities on the American mainland. The work further asserts that four distinct, ideology-based social movements formed and developed during this same time period -- America-Japan dualism, radicalism, Americanism, and ethnocentrism. Although there was some overlap with the community hierarchy, notably with regard to the ethnocentric and dualist movements, the four social movements operated largely independent of and isolated from each other and from the four tiers and the student sphere. The work concludes that ethnocentric efforts, particularly those of ethnic Japanese churches, were crucial in nurturing ethnic-based social and cultural capital among Nikkei residents of New York City. The churches were largely responsible for maintaining a collective Nikkei identity and a semblance of community solidarity amidst the status, class, and sociopolitical ideological divisions.",304948983,,Dissertations & Theses," Inouye, Daniel H.InouyeH.DanielInouye, Daniel H.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1826277621 , 47700731 , 66569 , 9781109258141 , 3360480 , 3360480", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,9.78E+12, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304948983?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , American history , Modern history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Civil rights , Class and status , Japanese foreign policy , Japanese-Americans , New York , New York City , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nine+clouds%3A+A+social+history+of+New+York+City+Nikkei%2C+volume+1%2C+1900%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Inouye%2C+Daniel+H.&amp;isbn=9781109258141&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.500520706,0.994694517,3385,Left,pacifism,British Quakers,"Friendly patriotism: british quakerism and the imperial nation, 1890-1910","In the arc of the years 1890 to 1910, British Quakers wrestled almost continually and inconclusively over the question of the Society of Friends' right relationship to the State, to the Empire, to politics, and to government. Conflicting pressures toward respectability and radicalism repeatedly tested the Society's loyalties to the Imperial nation and to its heritage of Dissent. It is in this period of what came to be known as the 'Quaker Renaissance' that I have located the emergence of what I call 'Friendly patriotism' - a complex set of attitudes by which public - spirited Quakers attempted to straddle multiple identities. Radical Dissenter and Evangelical Nonconformist; Christian Prophet and Subject of Empire - the 'Friendly patriot' of the period struggled to be true to sometimes wildly divergent traditions and impulses in his desire to embody an ideal of 'Christian citizenship'. No longer a 'Peculiar People', no longer relegated to a social or economic periphery, Quakers had been self-consciously integrating themselves into the mainstream of British life with enviable speed and success. At the close of the nineteenth century, the Society of Friends developed an acute sense of a special Quaker mission to improve the public culture of the day. What were perceived as the Society's unique spiritual and ethical testimonies were to become the essential ingredients of a national and international regeneration. The health of the Emprie rested, in part, with the capacity of civic-minded Friends to commit themselves to its care. Quakerism began to view itself not simply as being integrated into British public life, but integral to its further development. The welfare of the State became intimately linked to the effectiveness of Quaker participation in its political institutions. In this thesis, I have chosen to focus upon three of the most vivid expressions of the social and poltiical feeling within the Society of Friends which I have called 'Friendly patriotism'. The Quaker response to the Nonconformist campaign against the 1902 Education Act, the Quaker approach to international relations within the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European peace movement, and the Quaker crusade on behalf of Anglo-German friendship before the First World War revealed the Society's eagerness to interpret and re-interpret its extraordinary heritage of pacificsm and social responsibility in the light of the requirements of the new century. The outward turning of the Evangelical spirit, the firm conviction of Quakerism's unique message for both the churches and the governments of the world, and the profund belief in the Society of Friends' responsibility for the spiritual well-being of the Empire are reflected in each of these dimensions of the Society's life during the period. This work attempts to lift Quaker historiography out of the inevitable parochialism of 'in-house' denominational scholarship in which it has long been mired, and place a critical moment in the history of the Society of Friends within the context of a broader intellectual and cultural framework.",301520213,,Dissertations & Theses," Phillips, Brian DavidPhillipsDavidBrianPhillips, Brian David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1752114211 , 44183991 , 101309 , U017127 , U017127", Dissertation/Thesis,1989,, English, English,,1989,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1989,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301520213?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU017127 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Friendly+patriotism%3A+british+quakerism+and+the+imperial+nation%2C+1890-1910&amp;issn=&amp;date=1989-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Phillips%2C+Brian+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.794772196,0.943372861,1499,Left,pacifism,Peace in Early Nineteenth-Century New England,"Visions of a Peaceful World: Locating Peace in Early Nineteenth-Century New England, 1805â€“1850","Early nineteenth-century America witnessed a crusade to end all war and establish a peaceful culture. The energy behind the movement came from New England, not from mid-Atlantic Quakers. Made up of military veterans, liberal and conservative Christians, entrepreneurs and merchants, mothers and moralists, these reformers argued that all war, even the American Revolution, was contrary to Gospel ethics. I examine the lives and writings of four prominent peace advocates: Congregational minister Noah Worcester; Yankee entrepreneur and Presbyterian David Low Dodge; merchant, gentleman farmer, and orthodox Congregationalist convert William Ladd; and popular author and Episcopalian Lydia Huntley Sigourney. Drawing on their experiences with personal and local conflicts, they developed alternative pathways to peace, thereby emphasizing a variety of methods and outcomes. Dodge shunned government and renounced all forms of violence (even in self-defense). Worcester and Ladd placed their hope in governmentâ€”local, state, national, and international. Sigourney argued that peace depended on the education of women who would teach young men how to live in harmony. Despite their differences, all four argued that wars and violence were not natural but personal and collective choices. Peace was not merely the absence of violence or war. It was the creation and maintenance of social hierarchies and cultural systems at the local levelâ€”in families, churches, towns, and reform organizationsâ€”that promoted nonviolent conflict resolution. Previous studies of peace activism often present early reformers as participants in an unbroken chain of ""pacifists."" While it may be tempting to emphasize parallels between future pacifists and early peace advocates, we can comprehend activists' motivations and appreciate their diverse visions only by understanding their social and political milieus. Using a biographical lens, I analyze the interplay between personal experiences and ideological formation, explore the array of strategies offered by the leading peace advocates, and identify new contexts in which to understand peace advocacy, reform, and abolition. Conflicts and developments in early nineteenth-century New Englandâ€”such as the Unitarian controversy, the decline of the Federalist Party, the remaking of gender norms, and the growth of benevolent institutionsâ€”are key to understanding the leading reformers' inspirations and ideology.",1237999040,,Dissertations & Theses," Blythe, Patrick G.BlytheG.PatrickBlythe, Patrick G.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2840561601 , 71227352 , 66569 , 9781267795526 , 3533972 , 3533972", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1237999040?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies"," Religious history , American history , Peace Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American Peace Society , Antebellum , Early Republic , New England , Peace movements , Social reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visions+of+a+Peaceful+World%3A+Locating+Peace+in+Early+Nineteenth-Century+New+England%2C+1805%E2%80%931850&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blythe%2C+Patrick+G.&amp;isbn=9781267795526&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.833884335,0.918565072,3441,Left,pacifism,pacifism in the northern states during the Civil War era,"""The weapons of our warfare are not carnal"": Civil War pacifism, perfectionism, and roots of post-war radicalism","This study concerns pacifism in the northern states during the Civil War era and its connection with post-war radicalism. It focuses on an eclectic group of perfectionist pacifists who opposed the war on the basis of their religious convictions, which stemmed from their views on Christian perfection, the Government of God, and the millennium. Believing God's laws supreme over laws of human origin, the perfectionists refused to support or take part in the Federal government's war effort because God's laws demanded that they reject all violence, even if positive results may result from its use. Having experienced ridicule, accusations of treason, ostracism, and the specter of conscription during the war, the perfectionist pacifists united in its wake to create the Universal Peace Union (UPU). Through the UPU the perfectionists strove to convince the rest of humanity to recognize God's laws as the highest source of authority and to bring their governments into conformity with God's laws. They envisioned a day when all nations subordinated themselves to the Government of God, creating a ""universal republic"" of nations. Once accomplished, they posited, all evils, including international strife, would cease to exist. The pacifists' quest for a perfect world led them to expand their activities to a wide variety of issues within the United States such as Reconstruction, Native American policy, labor relations, education reform, and equal rights among others. In an era when American society and American reformers grew pessimistic about the possibility of individual and societal perfection, the pacifists perpetuated the tradition of perfectionism that characterized antebellum reform.

The thesis focuses on the primary institutions engaged in the Peace Campaign: the World Peace Council and the Soviet Peace Committee. Chapter 1 outlines the domestic and international context which fostered the peace movement (provisional title) and endeavours to construct a narrative of the political and social situation which the Soviet Union found itself in after World War II (as a superpower and an empire leading the Socialist Bloc) in order to put forward the argument that the motivations for undertaking the project of the 'peace movement', above all, were of an international-political nature, rather than of an internal and domestic nature. Chapter 2 starts off with the Soviet project of establishing an international peace movement, including firstly the World Peace Congress, which simultaneously convened in Paris and Prague, and then proceeds with the institutional, political and social development of the Campaign up to the dissolution of the Cominform in 1956. The task of this chapter is not merely to chronicle the history of the Soviet Peace Campaign, but to extract from the narrative underlying themes and organise them accordingly. Finally, Chapter 3 deals with internal Soviet Peace Campaign. The task here is to construct a historical account of the Soviet anti-war movement from 1949 to 1956 through the institutional history of the Soviet Peace Committee. Furthermore, the aim is to demonstrate the relationship between the Soviet Peace Committee and party and state institutions and its dependency on and implications for political decision-making processes within the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Finally, this chapter will also examine the role of the Soviet Peace Committee and its affiliated institutions in the advancement of Cold War propaganda through the media (i.e. press, journalism, etc.), literature (i.e. novels, poems, etc.), film and political art (i.e. posters, caricature, etc.).",1916426282,,Dissertations & Theses," Dobrenko, VladimirDobrenkoVladimirDobrenko, Vladimir", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4323142201 , 105317442 , 101309 , 10625775 , 10625775 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3479/", Dissertation/Thesis,2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1916426282?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3479/ , (UMI)AAI10625775 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conspiracy+of+peace%3A+the+cold+war%2C+the+international+peace+movement%2C+and+the+soviet+peace+campaign%2C+1946-1956&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dobrenko%2C+Vladimir&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.577847502,0.899279114,1084,Left,pacifism,"anti-war, Youth International Party, also known as Yippies","Radical street theatre and the Yippie legacy: A performance history of the Youth International Party, 1967â€“1968","In 1967 and 1968, members of the Youth International Party, also known as Yippies, created several mass street demonstrations to protest President Lyndon Baines Johnsonâ€™s handling of the United Statesâ€™ military involvement in the war in Vietnam. The Yippies were a loose network of hippies, anti-war activists, and left-wing radicals committed to cultural and political change. This dissertation investigates how the Yippies used avant-garde theories of theatre and performance in their year of demonstrating against the Johnson administration. The Yippies receive little attention in most histories of American performance, and theatre remains on the margins of political and social histories of the 1960s; therefore this dissertation places performance and political archives side by side to create a new historical narrative of the Yippies and performance. The Yippies created their own networked participatory street performance form by drawing on the political philosophy of the New Left student movement, the organizational strategies of the anti-war movement, and the countercultural values of the hippies. They modified this performance form, which they termed ""revolutionary actiontheater,"" with performance theories drawn from New Yorkâ€™s avant-garde art world, the concept of guerrilla theatre outlined by R. G. Davis of the San Francisco Mime Troupe, and the notion of Theater of Cruelty created by Antonin Artaud. Using performance theory and cultural history as primary methodologies, this project traces the Yippiesâ€™ adoption of revolutionary action-theater with three examples: the 1967 ""March on the Pentagon"" where future Yippie leaders performed an exorcism ritual at the Pentagon; the 1968 ""Grand Central Station Yip-In"" event that advertised for the Yippie movement; and the 1968 ""Festival of Life"" at the National Democratic Convention in Chicago where the Yippies nominated a pig as presidential candidate. The final chapter on the recent phenomenon of flash mobs argues that the Yippiesâ€™ legacy lives on in this participatory street performance form, and suggests that revolutionary action-theater can still serve as a model for political action.",304483585,,Dissertations & Theses," Shawyer, Susanne ElizabethShawyerElizabethSusanneShawyer, Susanne Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1597612851 , 38618391 , 66569 , 9780549764052 , 3324677 , 3324677", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304483585?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater"," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater"," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater",," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater"," American history , Theater"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , 1968 , Activism , Flash mob , Performance , Performance history , Politics , Street theatre , Yippies , Youth International Party",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Radical+street+theatre+and+the+Yippie+legacy%3A+A+performance+history+of+the+Youth+International+Party%2C+1967%E2%80%931968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shawyer%2C+Susanne+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780549764052&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.437002393,0.899042811,3452,Left,pacifism,student movement of the late 1960s,Sendero Luminoso and the Indian problem in contemporary Peru: Conquering the other,"In the years following World War II, Peru experienced rapid economic and cultural changes, but within the confines of capitalism's uneven and contradictory development.

The complex, often ambiguous, ethnic landscape of the Andes, in which Sendero operates with mixed success, although long since penetrated by the destructive forces of capitalism, has proven impervious to Western social scientists and the Peruvian intellectual elite. In response to Sendero and the violence of the war both have resurrected, implicitly or explicitly, the old debate on the ""Indian problem.""

One such group of scholars are public sphere theorists, who, taking up an ongoing concern with the conditions for, and criteria of, effective democratic participation in politically authoritative policy debates, and responding to these new dynamics, have begun to define a new research agenda in search of 'transnational public spheres' (Habermas, 1989; Fraser, 1991; Fraser 2007). That is, they have begun to look to the transnational for sites in which those affected by the exercise (or, indeed, absence) of political authority at this level strive to engage that authority in policy debate. In this thesis, I argue for the existence of one such transnational public sphere, which, being both provoked and constituted by the transnational peasant and small farmers social movement La Via Campesina, promises to be institutionally realised by the recently reformed United Nations Committee on World Food Security (CFS).

My research builds on Albuquerqueâ€™s arguments about the construction of o Nordeste in the twentieth century by situating them in the milieu of political and cultural debates that attempted to redefine Northeastern Brazil during the Cold War. Rural social movements (associated with the Catholic Church, the Communist Party, and the Ligas Camponesas ), large landowners, filmmakers and intellectuals, popular poets, U.S. and Brazilian politicians and journalists, and Brazilian military officers proposed projects to change the structures that they saw as perpetuating regional inequalities. To gain support for their political projects, these social, political and cultural movements appropriated regional historical symbols and narratives, imbuing them with new meanings. In doing so, they sought to redefine regional identity, and to a certain extent, also looked to redefine national and Third World identity. During the Cold War, identity expanded to becoming a product of local, national and transnational discussions, facilitated by the expansion of film as a medium of mass culture. The debates over the meaning of regional historical symbols and regional identity in Northeastern Brazil are at once an exaggerated and exemplary microcosm of Cold War political and cultural struggles in Latin America and in the Third World. The characters in the story had counterparts in other countries, and the setting was one of the most socially unequal areas in the world espousing all of the problems and possibilities of impoverished areas during the Cold War. The struggles also occurred at a key moment in Cold War history in Latin America: the era of the Cuban Revolution. But, the Northeast was not a blank slate for Cold War policies; in fact, the region had entrenched cultural symbols and historical narratives that composed the framework for the debates over regional identity.",250823545,,Dissertations & Theses," Sarzynski, Sarah R.SarzynskiR.SarahSarzynski, Sarah R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757060371 , 41089491 , 66569 , 9780549965947 , 3341426 , 3341426", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250823545?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history"," Latin American history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Brazil , Cold War , Ligas Camponesas , Northeastern Brazil , Rural social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=History%2C+identity+and+the+struggle+for+land+in+northeastern+Brazil%2C+1955%E2%80%931985&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sarzynski%2C+Sarah+R.&amp;isbn=9780549965947&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.746721133,0.94464126,455,Left,peasants,Transnational Agrarian Movements (Via Campesina and IFAP) ,The Politics of Transnational Agrarian Movements (Via Campesina and IFAP) on Genetically Modified Crops and Agrofuels,"Mainstream agricultural development policy, in regards to alleviating hunger and poverty, has been biased in favour of the industrial model of production.

Transnational agrarian movements such as the International Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP) and La Via Campesina have taken policy and political positions on these two controversial and highly debated issues. Their positions are different, yet often they are conflated in the policy, political and academic literature, explicitly and implicitly treating transnational agrarian movements as a monolithic bloc.

Without speaking directly to current ethnic conflict, it links it with the social and class relations that emerged in the decades after slavery ended. It posits that out of this history new thinking must emerge. Such new ways of thinking it argues must attempt to and seriously adumbrate the conjunctive role of the world sugar market which influenced Guyanaâ€™s rise to prominence as a sugar producer and the special environmental and ecological determinants, and how these shaped, over time, the particular historical and political outlook of the social relations within the state which has, in turn, consumed the sociological and political elasticity of the national space. From the background of history this work focuses on the social relations that emerged and developed on the ground as Guyanaâ€™s potential for sugar was forged in the context of slave abolition and emancipation, and the emergent concrete totality of new and forming multiple actors within the national space. It expands the breadth of the already established analytical literature which has concentrated either on the role and impact on history of the plantation, the colonial state, the village movement, the African and or the East Indian indentured servants. In extolling the role of the local and global economy in the shaping of social and ethnic relations in Guyana, it spotlights how the growth of the â€œsecond slaveryâ€ in Cuba, Brazil and the United States in the throes of the abolition of the slave trade served as an important backdrop through which the processes of African marginalization emerged and took root in Guyana. Finally, this work exposes the manner in which the sugar economy and the environment provided the means and context for the encirclement of African labor after emancipation. It exposes the limits of existing literature which assumed that a â€œpeasantryâ€ developed because of land availability. It thus joins in the critique of existing literature which was begun by Walter Rodney in 1978.",304323814,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohamed, WazirMohamedWazirMohamed, Wazir", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594497931 , 40164721 , 66569 , 9780549715498 , 3320171 , 3320171", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304323814?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Black history , Latin American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Free African , Guyana , Marginalization , Peasants , Sugar economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Frustrated+peasants%2C+marginalized+workers%3A+Free+African+villages+in+Guyana%2C+1838%E2%80%931885&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohamed%2C+Wazir&amp;isbn=9780549715498&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.012055019,0.93084461,282,Left,peasants,Landless worker resistance in lowland Bolivia,Performative politics: Landless workers' creative strategies of resistance in lowland Bolivia,"This dissertation explores, through one case study of the Bolivian El Movimiento Sin Tierra (Landless Peasant Movement-MST), the specific cultural strategiesâ€”the discourses, oral tales of Incan ancestors, and Andean customsâ€”that have proved critical to movement building at the regional, national, and international level. The main theoretical thrust of this work is to challenge new social movement theory, which focuses solely on identity-based politics, and thus to complicate reductionist economistic approaches to peasant politics. An identity-based approach fails to see cultural struggles in dynamic relationship to larger political and economic transitions, while a deterministic political-economic analysis often obfuscates the subtle, everyday social interactions critical to shaping oppositional politics at local and regional levels. Instead, this study emphasizes the concrete historical processes of uneven geographic development that gave rise to new social movements of displaced farmers who rely upon a rich highland indigenous identity as a critical cultural and political resource. Performative oral tales of ancient Andean mythical heroes and their ayllu communities motivate the landless to take part in land occupations and serve as a blueprint or creative cartography for the remapping of communal and productive relations. The transport of oral tales from the local to the regional level defines horizontal, participatory, and democratic spaces of governance. Cultural-political framings such as the ayllu are no longer confined to a particular locale, but over time have become transportable and elastic discourses used to negotiate national-level land policies and redistributive reforms. Finally, this dissertation documents the spectacular backlash to such progressive movements and maps new forms of right-wing resistance in the region. I return to performative politics as an analytic construct and present some of the murky terrain as cultural strategies move from localized movement building to national and international arenas.

However often the organic ties between locally based intellectuals and the peasant organizations are severed and result in a change in representative discourse from one of representation to one of paternalism. The effect is a new class dynamic between the peasantry and the urban professional class from which these intellectuals are drawn. In order to comprehend the change in class ties and between intellectuals and peasant organizations it is necessary to understand the influence exerted by international non governmental organizations (NGOs) on local governments and social movements and how peasant organizations serve to justify the NGOs mission statement and financial support. To achieve this we must pay close attention to the system by which international aid organizations communicate and work with local level peasant associations through the mediation of local level intellectuals and professional supporters. This research, adopting a Gramscian theoretical approach, provides an ethnographic analysis of peasant associations in rural Haiti and their collaborative and conflicting relationships with agronomist-intellectuals and the NGOs for whom these intellectuals work. Based on nine months intensive ethnographic study in rural southwest Haiti, this research concludes that localized intellectuals, as intermediaries between northern development organizations and southern grassroots associations, act as carriers of a northern hegemonic development discourse that seeks to position these associations as organizations of civil society that support free market principles and mechanisms. As peasant associations adopt this discourse through participation in the benefits of economic development practice, there develops contradictions in the political self-consciousness of these associations. Though this contradictory consciousness allows the peasantry to organize for the betterment of their communities, it prevents the development of a political consciousness by preventing these associations from involvement in political processes or political action. The broader implication of these conclusions is a reconsideration of the perceived relationship between civil society and political society by development agencies as they work among southern populations around the world.",304445170,,Dissertations & Theses," Vannier, Christian N.VannierN.ChristianVannier, Christian N.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472134401 , 39055821 , 66569 , 9780549450825 , 3300459 , 3300459", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304445170?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Agronomists , Caribbean , Development , Haiti , Intellectuals , NGOs , Nongovernmental organizations , Peasants",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+know+the+field+better%3A+Peasant+associations%2C+NGOs%2C+and+agronomists+in+rural+Haitian+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vannier%2C+Christian+N.&amp;isbn=9780549450825&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.368445639,0.942991432,3581,Mixed,peasants,Alliance for Progress and land reform in Latin America,"An embattled idealism: Land reform, the Alliance for Progress, and the struggle for social justice in American foreign policy","The 1960s was a time of great promise and tremendous disappointment in the United States. This was demonstrated in both foreign and domestic policy, from the struggles, triumphs, and continuing frustrations of the Civil Rights movement through the soaring hopes of the Great Society to the escalating tragedy of Vietnam. In this thesis, I suggest that we add the Alliance for Progress to that list as an example of an embattled and eventually defeated idealism in American foreign policy. My central argument is that the idealist notion that American foreign policy in Latin America could and should be a constructive undertaking for all parties involved was a central element in the creation of the Alliance for Progress in the late 1950s and 1960s. Accompanied by the pragmatic concern to prevent the spread of the Cuban Revolution throughout the hemisphere, it was articulated as a call for a socially just foreign policy. Although this vision was consistently pursued by a only a small number of individuals, it had a lasting influence and impact in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Those people who believed in a socially just foreign policy also believed that a key element of such a policy was land reform, and therein lay the rub. To focus on this issue, at least in Latin America, was to pursue a dangerous and doomed policy, as threats to landed power were perceived as threats to good trade relations and anti-communist political alliances. A reading of U.S. government documents, the public record, and archival material from the Kennedy, Johnson, and Agency for International Development Libraries demonstrates a vigorous internal discussion of the role of social justice in foreign policy, and reveals that the tensions between pragmatic and idealistic concerns ultimately doomed the Alliance for Progress as an attempt to redefine the Americanâ€”Latin American relationship.",304475855,,Dissertations & Theses," Stratton, Sara AnnStrattonAnnSaraStratton, Sara Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733020331 , 29180251 , 66569 , 0612335534 , 9780612335530 , NQ33553 , NQ33553", Dissertation/Thesis,1998," 0612335534 , 9780612335530", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304475855?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0337 American history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," American history , Political science , International law , International relations"," Social sciences , Alliance for Progress , Foreign policy , Johnson administration , Kennedy administration , Land reform , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+embattled+idealism%3A+Land+reform%2C+the+Alliance+for+Progress%2C+and+the+struggle+for+social+justice+in+American+foreign+policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stratton%2C+Sara+Ann&amp;isbn=0612335534&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.487607837,0.954051369,3468,Left,pluralism,Jamesian pluralism and liberal progressivism,"""An innocent way out"": The literature and politics of cultural pluralism, 1880-1925","In contemporary debates on multiculturalism, 'pluralism' signifies a number of contradictory and mutually exclusive ideological positions. This dissertation situates these debates by locating the cultural and intellectual antecedents of multiculturalism beyond the social movements of the 1960s, and toward the turn of the century. The first part of the dissertation explores the intellectual genealogy of pluralism within the pragmatic tradition of William James. In 1898, James summarizes the crux of his concept in a syllabus for Philosophy I at Harvard: ""The rule is that one victorious should so far as possible keep the vanquished somehow represented. Find some innocent way out."" His brand of 'genteel pluralism' illustrates a form of crisis management, which tries to expand the boundaries of cultural inclusion at a time when the nation was undergoing dramatic demographic and economic changes. After the First World War, two of James' students, Horace Kallen and W. E. B. Du Bois, develop a pluralist politics but along different ideological lines. Kallen appropriates Jamesian pluralism for liberal progressivism, while Du Bois inscribes it within a tradition of international socialism. The second half of the dissertation examines the aesthetic manifestations of pluralism in two popular genres of the turn of the century magazine boom: local color sketches and intra-urban walking tours. Both genres chronicle ""how the other half lives,"" either from the perspective of the Howellsian flaneur searching for picturesque ruins in the Lower East Side tenements, or Garland's ""native novelist"" representing the ""vanquished"" regions of the nation. Pluralism's elasticity, however, reaches its representational limit with Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton's use of the term ""vanquished"" to describe the Mexicans who lost their land in post-1848 California and Mary Church Terrell's 1903 alternative walking narrative of Washington, D.C. The epilogue explores the development of contemporary socialist renditions of multiculturalism. These renditions show a counter-hegemonic genealogy of pluralism, which still continues among certain cultural workers today.",304118100,,Dissertations & Theses," Bramen, Carrie A. TiradoBramenA.

It was born into a time of social upheaval in the country in the early 1990s, when students and professors were at the forefront of a movement demanding political pluralism: Today, Zouglou has also become Cote d'Ivoire's internationally most successful music. This thesis provides a detailed history of Zouglou's development from the university residence in Yopougon through the precarious neighbourhoods of Abidjan to its rise in international charts. It argues that the power of Zouglou music is located in a number of factors: as an urban music, Zouglou is not associated with any particular region or ethnic group; it is a supra-ethnic, national music which is of special significance at a time in Ivoirian history where political battles have divided the country into a northern and a southern half. As a new, urban musical form, Zouglou distinguishes itself through its use of Nouchi, the French street-slang spoken in Abidjan, and its use of very direct, outspoken texts, rather than of subtle, coded messages. It is well known that in many African cultures, musical performance is evaluated primarily through the song texts. Based on the idea that the strength of Zouglou music lies in its song texts, this thesis gives detailed analyses of their content. Zouglou's pervasive use of satirical humour has won it many listeners and great acclaim. Thus, Zouglou has in a real sense become street poetry, and its main themes criticise and comment on social problems. Zouglou is also known to criticise the behaviour of the political elite, and thus has gained a reputation as socially and political engaged music. Zouglou musicians have, through their songs, taken the initiative of public debate in the country, and have been considered as speaking in lieu of intellectuals, despite frequently being school drop-outs. In one of Zouglou's first recordings, its dance was described as a dancep hilosophique,a philosophical dance. Despite its intrinsically popular and mediated nature, Zouglou has, through its reflective song texts, remained true to this description, as this thesis demonstrates",1442503867,,Dissertations & Theses," Schumann, AnneSchumannAnneSchumann, Anne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101288871 , 80741192 , 101309 , U597657 , U597657", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442503867?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," (UMI)AAIU597657 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Danse+philosophique%21%3A+the+social+and+political+dynamics+of+zouglou+music+in+abidjan%2C+c%C3%B4te+d%27ivoire%2C+1990-2008&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schumann%2C+Anne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.794605198,0.985684028,983,Left,political participation,participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre,The migration of meaning: A comparative analysis of understandings of &lt;i&gt;OrÃ§amento Participativo&lt;/i&gt; in Porto Alegre and participatory budgeting in the Toronto Community Housing Corporation,"In 1989, the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre initiated a successful model of Participatory Budgeting, which has subsequently been implemented in cities throughout the world, including in the Toronto Community Housing Corporation. This paper analyses differences in understanding and shifts in meaning that occur when a Participatory Budgeting model from a Brazilian Portuguese Porto-Alegrense socio-political historical and cultural context is translocated to a Canadian English Toronto context. By examining five key terms, I compare the understandings of OrÃ§amento Participativo in Porto Alegre to Participatory Budgeting in Toronto. Different understandings may result in different outcomes. This paper is based on De Sousa Santos' call for a giant work of translation, which includes a greater need for understanding of the differences between international social movements within the World Social Forum. Greater understanding will open a space for dialogue and mutual learning, creating a path towards emancipation from the neoliberal agenda.* Key Words.

Since its emergence as a tool for development in the 1970 microlending has become a key tactic for many developing countries in their attempt to reduce poverty and improve the lives of the poor. With the arrival of the global recession, however, the weaknesses of this strategy were highlighted as growing numbers of individuals around the globe struggled to make payments on their microloans. Faced with shame, loss of land and property, or jail, debtors around the globe responded to their situations in very different ways. In Nicaragua they turned to protest. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork, but drawing on twelve years of experience in the community, this study examines the strategies used by households in a small farming community to make ends meet and deal with the high levels of risk inherent in a subsistence economy in the wake of the collapse of the microfinance industry in the country. Central to this is the recognition of the constantly shifting political and economic terrain of Nicaragua and its influence on the everyday lives of citizens. What emerged as a key component of the research was the role of the Citizens Power Council (CPC), the community level government, as a major force in the community. Through the examination of multiple processes of power and governmentality the CPC emerges as an important tool of the state able to influence political and economic decisions of community members. With the ethnographic exploration of two ongoing social movements the power held by the CPC is revealed in their attempt to manipulate civil society at the ground level. The ability of the state to influence social movements is examined and the potential ramifications are discussed. Situating this research within the realm of political economy, development, and the pink tide that is currently sweeping Latin America, this study emphasizes the importance of contextualization and highlights the central role of ethnography in understanding what is happening on the ground with development projects and programs.",1030968557,,Dissertations & Theses," Kurlanska, Courtney BrookeKurlanskaBrookeCourtneyKurlanska, Courtney Brooke", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2727893751 , 69691082 , 66569 , 9781267473066 , 3517205 , 3517205", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030968557?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Cultural anthropology , Agricultural economics"," Social sciences , Development , Governmentality , Microfinance , Nicaragua , Political economy , Risk , Rural finance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grains%2C+greenbacks+and+governance%3A++The+political+economy+of+rural+microfinance+in+Nicaragua&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kurlanska%2C+Courtney+Brooke&amp;isbn=9781267473066&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.828242713,0.975353723,583,Left,political participation,Macedonian and Serbian activism against state oppression,Transnational advocacy networks: the case of roma mobilization in macedonia and serbia,"The purpose of this study is to ascertain and explain the effectiveness of Roma political activism in contesting state oppression in Macedonia and Serbia. More specifically, this thesis seeks to investigate the divergent treatment of Roma communities in the respective states by analyzing the role of state institutions, civil society, political parties and international organizations. The thesis seeks to provide a multi-level analysis of Roma mobilization in Macedonia and Serbia by addressing the domestic and international factors that influence Roma political activism, and relies on two main theoretical concepts within the social movement literature: the Political Opportunity Structure (POS) model and 'transnational advocacy networks.' The POS model is a comprehensive framework to assess if Roma political activism has been effective in Macedonia and Serbia. This study uses the following components to describe the domestic factors that may facilitate or constrain Romani activism in the respective states: state repression and/or facilitation, institutional access, influential domestic and international allies. This thesis attempts to provide a detailed analysis of movement dynamics by taking into account the inter-relationship between actors and contesting groups. The limitations of the domestic opportunity structure regarding Roma advocacy in Macedonia and Serbia are outlined by describing the political context concerning minority inclusion, institutional mechanisms, and NGO/political party activities. As domestic opportunity structures are 'closed,' Roma activists and NGOs seek international allies to influence and change domestic policy on Roma inclusion. This study, while recognizing the importance of other international initiatives, specifically focuses on various institutions of the European Union as the main international actor influencing Roma inclusion policies in Eastern Europe. The thesis outlines the main EU initiatives on Roma inclusion to provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges in the international arena. Furthermore, it analyzes the interaction between international and civil society organizations assessing the effectiveness of the 'transnational advocacy networks.'

Based on archival research in Afghanistan, Turkey, India, and Britain, the study uncovers the longue durÃ©e history behind the text, including the genesis of its drafting commission, its multinational contributors from Constantinople to Qandahar, and the challenges they overcame in producing the pioneering charter. Drawing on records and manuscripts in Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and Urdu, the study first traces the burgeoning tripartite ties between Ottomans, Afghans, and Indians from the aftermath of the 1857 Sepoy Rebellion to World War I. While historians of Pan-Islamism have tended to focus on radical ideologues and militant jihads, the emphasis on confrontation with the west has overlooked more subtle internal processes, such as the surge in students and scholarsâ€”as well as texts and ideasâ€”traversing between the Ottoman and British empires at this time. Challenging conventional tropes of warring tribes and barren frontiers, I locate Afghanistan as a crucial juncture for such transnational social networks, and a center of debates about law, citizenship, and what it meant to be a modern Muslim. The dissertation culminates with the convergence of three simultaneous developments of profound historical impact in the greater Middle East: the collapse of the Ottoman empire, Afghanistan's independence from Britain in 1919, and the Indian KhilÄfat Movement of 1919-1924. Amidst this dramatic backdrop of revolutionary politics and Pan-Islamic activism, I draw attention to an untold juridical history: the ensuing competition between Ottoman lawyers, Afghan administrators, and Indian jurists who converged in Kabul to market their expertise to the world's only fully-sovereign ""Islamic state."" It was the synthesis of these legal actors and the diverse juridical histories they represented, I conclude, that ultimately produced Afghanistan's first constitution between 1919 and 1923. In unearthing the social and cultural origins of Afghanistan's first constitution, the dissertation contributes a long overdue corrective to the scarce scholarly literature on Afghan legal history. The study also problematizes literature on the modern Middle East that silences the non-Ottoman ""periphery"" as passive objects caught between the colonial rivalry of Britain and Russia. Such works, I show, ignore the contributions of other independent rulers in the region such as the BÄrakzai dynasty in Kabul, including the Afghan monarchs Amir `Abd al-RahmÄn (1880-1901), Amir HabÄ«b-AllÄh (1901-1919), and Amir AmÄn-AllÄh (1919-1929) in particular. By examining the Afghan court's patronage of scholarly networks from Damascus to Delhi, I argue that this unique constitutional project cannot be reduced to European mimicry and obeisance, nor an identity politics of Pan-Islam triggered at the behest of the Ottomans. In this manner, the dissertation enriches Afghanistan studies beyond the confines of the Great Game, Cold War, or recent literature on ""failed states."" Instead, the study persuades us to rediscover Afghanistan with a different pastâ€”when Kabul represented a center of debates, cosmopolitanism, and contested visions of reform in the region. The dissertation's focus on emergent transnational Islamic legal culturesâ€”or juridical Pan-Islamismâ€”between the late Ottoman empire, British India, and Afghanistan illustrates how modern notions of law, administration, and statecraft transcended politically-bounded territories. More specifically, the study sharpens our understanding of how urban centers within the vast socio-cultural zone stretching from the Balkans to Bengal came to be increasingly linked through specific networks, institutions, and processes of expertise associated with Islamic legal modernism. In tracing the social and institutional genealogy of the first Afghan constitution (1923), the dissertation examines how modern Muslim legal practices developing in Istanbul, Kabul, and greater Delhi in the long nineteenth century could simultaneously overlap, intersect, and co-evolve into distinct Ottoman, Afghan, and Indian juridical fields. Finally, as a socio-legal history it shows how a diverse cast of actorsâ€”Turks and Arabs, Indians and Persians, but most of all, Afghansâ€”shaped the fields of constitutional law and politics in the greater Islamic world.",1719261987,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahmed, FaizAhmedFaizAhmed, Faiz", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3827899881 , 99423742 , 66569 , 9781339013046 , 3720334 , 3720334", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1719261987?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," Middle Eastern history , Islamic Studies"," Social sciences , Afghanistan , Constitutionalism , Islamic law , Legal history , Ottoman empire , Socio-legal history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rule+of+Law+Experts+in+Afghanistan%3A+A+Socio-Legal+History+of+the+First+Afghan+Constitution+and+the+Indo-Ottoman+Nexus+in+Kabul%2C+1860-1923&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Faiz&amp;isbn=9781339013046&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.736675663,0.955173545,34,Left,political participation,nformation technology as a means of political activism in the Middle East,Constructed identities: New social movements and computer -mediated communication in the Middle East,"International communications is an important component of the international system at the dawn of the 21st century. This dissertation examines information technology as a means of political activism among new social movements in the Middle East. I am interested in examining the socio-economic and socio-political factors that make modern information technology a useful and viable tool for political and social movements in dealing with state policies. The rigid control of the traditional media by the state in the Middle East has forced social movements in the region to work as expatriate movements based outside the region. By locating themselves outside the rigid control of Middle Eastern states, these social movements are internationalizing their disagreements with the state. They benefit from more liberal laws and greater freedom. The importance of international communication cannot be, but often is, overlooked in the literature. This dissertation addresses the changing nature of social movement and media relations in an increasingly international context. The emphasis is on how the social movements use the new media technologies to construct particular identities to reach a broader audience, promote their agenda(s), recruit new members, and raise funds.",304987177,,Dissertations & Theses," Roberts, Joseph W.RobertsW.JosephRoberts, Joseph W.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1127208651 , 33457651 , 66569 , 9780542580949 , 0542580942 , 3209640 , 3209640", Dissertation/Thesis,2006," 9780542580949 , 0542580942", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304987177?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0723 Information systems"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0723 Information systems"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0723 Information systems",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0723 Information systems"," Political science , International law , International relations , Information systems"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Computer-mediated communication , Identity construction , Internationalization , Middle East , New social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructed+identities%3A++New+social+movements+and+computer+-mediated+communication+in+the+Middle+East&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roberts%2C+Joseph+W.&amp;isbn=9780542580949&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.912876256,0.933398612,383,Left,political participation,post-conflict democracy-building,Watching the world watch: News media and the everyday politics of international oversight in post-conflict Macedonia,"This dissertation is an ethnography of the Macedonian public sphere. It analyzes contemporary forms of international intervention associated with transnational â€œglobal governanceâ€ and European integration. Following the 2001 armed conflict in Macedonia, diplomats and officials from the European Union and United States saturated the Macedonian public sphere with value-laden evaluations of the country's political maturity and prescriptive expectations for its future. I show how the public speech of foreign officials in Macedonia depended on and enacted a different set of communicative norms, language ideologies, and metadiscursive regimentations when compared to the standards that mediated and shaped participation in Macedonia's national public. I then demonstrate how the gap between foreigner and Macedonian â€œregimes of publicityâ€ animated new political and social engagements in Macedonia as political actors and ordinary citizens would refigure the discursive forms locally associated with â€œEuropeâ€ in pursuit of recognition and authority before contrasting international and domestic audiences. The dissertation details this recognition politics through ethnographic descriptions of: news media production, a grassroots protest movement, politicians' performances, and everyday genres of sociality and self-presentation. Ultimately, the dissertation contends that international actors' achievement of an â€œoversight publicâ€ in Macedonia, and Macedonian practices that presupposed international oversight, constituted a central dimension to the remaking of Macedonia's post-conflict and post-socialist social order. By tying Macedonian ways of being and acting in public together with this particular rendering of post-conflict democracy-building, the dissertation amounts an ethnographic account of a new political subject who is dually interpellated by local social relations and the presumed gaze of foreigners. I illustrate how the double consciousness of Macedonian forms of publicity catalyzed an internationally sanctioned, neoliberal redistribution of rights and responsibility at the expense of pre-existing models of social entitlement. My attention to foreigner and Macedonian modes of publicity, and the tensions between them, provides a novel analytic and theoretical window on political communication and its relation to political structure, governmentality and political subjectivity. The dissertation adds a critical, ethnographic perspective to the study of global governance and European Union enlargement by a focus on communicative aspects of the cultural politics intrinsic to any transnational political exercise.",822630554,,Dissertations & Theses," Graan, AndrewGraanAndrewGraan, Andrew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2230992191 , 51510381 , 66569 , 9781124376639 , 3432720 , 3432720", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,9.78E+12, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822630554?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0391 Journalism , 0437 East European Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Journalism , East European Studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , European integration , International intervention , Macedonia , News media , Political communication , Publicity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Watching+the+world+watch%3A+News+media+and+the+everyday+politics+of+international+oversight+in+post-conflict+Macedonia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Graan%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781124376639&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.802143833,0.925926433,1125,Left,political participation,mobilizations against Cochabamba Water project and Mexico City airport project,Public policy and social movements: the cases of Bolivia and Mexico,"This thesis studies policy formation and implementation in Latin America in their interaction with processes of contentious politics and social mobilisation.Ã‚Â  It compares two case studies in the area of urban and physical infrastructure.Ã‚Â  The first one is the privatisation of water and sanitation services (WSS) in Cochabamba, Bolivia which was overturned in 2000 after opposing groups mobilised against the increase of fees and new water regulations that were deemed to be excessively biased towards the interests of private investors.Ã‚Â  This conflict has become known in the literature as the Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Cochabamba Water WarÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½.Ã‚Â  The second case is the project for a new international airport in Mexico City, which was promoted in 2001 and cancelled only one year later after analogous protests.

What is not known about this story is how this democracyâ€™s dynamism is fundamentally grounded on ongoing social movement activism that is constantly pressurizing the largely elite democratic institutions to better respond to the everyday needs of average Ghanaians. Critical to this pressurization is not only activism around domestic policies, but also a wide-spread ongoing questioning of the forces of transnational neoliberal governmentality that discipline, contain, and subvert the potential of African states to place the needs of their populace in-front of the needs of transnational capital. This is the alternative story of Ghanaâ€™s democracy told by this study, where Ghanaian activist-educators embedded in the countryâ€™s various contemporary social movements have come together in a participatory research endeavour to critically analyze Ghanaâ€™s current democratic terrain. Key to this analysis is the connection between Ghanaâ€™s social movement activism, and learning within these movements, to this reconstituted story of Ghanaâ€™s democracy. According to our participatory research group, it is the intersection of the ways movements learn and communicate with the ways these movements stay rooted in the needs of their wider membership that concomitantly determines their impact on the range of democratic possibility. Instrumental to this intersection, according to this study, are the informal processes through which movement members learn in, through, and to struggle.

Are ideas of European secularism shifting as a result of diversifying populations, and if so how? In the context of religion, there has been analysis devoted to understanding how religion can be a central tool for immigrants gaining social capital, adapting into a new society, and mobilizing politically to assert rights. Conflicts between religious values and national identity have spurred political action; however, the majority of these studies focus solely on religious and ethnic minorities in the community. In contemporary Europe, many have looked at Muslims and how their participation in Islam affects their understandings of national identity. This literature often treats Muslims as a separate from the mainstream; little attention is paid to how their ideas are similar to or different from those of other faith based groups. In order to understand if participation in a religious community influences experiences with marginalization and political participation, both the perspectives of religious and ethnic minorities as well as the religious ethnic majority must be accounted for. This dissertation uses case material collected from a year-long doctoral research study of both Christians and Muslims in Norway to answer: how is political participation affected by religious participation among those who are in the margins of dominant discourses of national identity? By drawing fruitful comparisons between both Christians and Muslims who struggle to negotiate their religious ideas with Norwegian dominant discourses of religious history, ethnicity, and secularism, this research reveals how cultivating a sense of belonging to a greater national narrative is a pivotal factor in motivating people to become active in social and political movements for change. In conclusion, individuals who successfully navigated between both their religious and secular social circles to develop a privatized idea of faith were more likely to be engaged in political movements beyond their respective houses of worship and ethnic enclaves. In comparison, those who possessed more closed social circles and cultivated less investment in national identity narratives were less active in political movements for change even if they experienced injustice first hand.",1789611272,,Dissertations & Theses," McKown, LaurenMcKownLaurenMcKown, Lauren0000-0003-4325-7079", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4059673501 , 104526012 , 66569 , 9781339679891 , 10104455 , 10104455", Dissertation/Thesis,2016,9.78E+12, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1789611272?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Connections , Crescent , Cross , Identity , National , Political , Religious",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+crescent+and+the+cross%3A+Examining+the+connections+among+religious+identity%2C+national+identity%2C+and+patterns+of+political+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKown%2C+Lauren&amp;isbn=9781339679891&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.92507045,0.911992689,199,Left,political participation,underground literature movement in post-World War II America,Voices from below: Locating the underground in post-World War II American literature,"This dissertation begins with the premise that scrutinizing imaginative representations of the underground can give us insight into its prevalence as an organizing principle in our cultural consciousness. Moreover, such a study is unbound to any particular identity or movement and thus offers a compelling framework for tracing our evolving conceptions of national identity and citizenship through intersecting histories of the dispossessed. Situating the underground in the historical and political context of the Cold War and beyond, I examine stories of resistance through a locale that is spatially configured as literally or figuratively below , in which those driven below the radar of their communities by social and political commitments animate what Richard Wright calls â€œthe underground logic of the democratic process.â€ I begin with Richard Wright's invocation of the underground as a topography of African-American life in The Man Who Lived Underground , which uses an old sewer to activate psychological links between rising and freedom in the pre-Civil Rights era. Shifting to the 1950s hipster culture, I argue that the subterranean imperative is cultural. In The Subterraneans , Jack Kerouac magnifies the contradictions of the hipster movement fraught with the social inequalities of the era by recuperating the democratic potential of cross-racial identification in ghostly reimaginings of Cherokees repopulating the land. I continue by tracing the underground's political iterations in the 1960s and 1970s, in which questions of nationhood emerge through global alliances formed by the activist youth movement. In American Woman , Susan Choi stages a feminist corrective to the excesses of the radical fugitive underground by providing a platform for redressing Japanese American Internment through a critique of U.S. imperialism. Finally, I argue that at the close of the twentieth century, the underground is the place where intersections between metaphorical and geopolitical borders are magnifiedâ€”where the material meets the symbolic most acutely. In Mosquito , Gayl Jones depicts a â€œnewâ€ Underground Railroad that spirits undocumented migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border, linking nineteenth-century anti-slavery crusades to the contemporary immigration rights movement. Jones inscribes a Pan-American vision into our national imaginary by interpolating population fluidity through the figure of the refugee and denaturalizing the border. In the twenty-first century, the underground offers the displaced subjects of official American histories possibilities for reinscription through a newly conceptualized cosmopolitanism. Their stories from below weave a narrative of solidarity between subjugated peoples throughout American history. The geography of such an underground presents new possibilities for transcultural and transnational mappings, which can provide a richer understanding of our intertwined pasts and a clearer blueprint for both local accountability and global mindedness.",304642393,,Dissertations & Theses," Vlagopoulos, PennyVlagopoulosPennyVlagopoulos, Penny", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1614926971 , 38618851 , 66569 , 9780549858751 , 3333455 , 3333455", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304642393?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , American literature , Choi, Susan , Jones, Gayl , Kerouac, Jack , Post-World War II American literature , Postwar , Underground , Underground resistance , Wright, Richard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Voices+from+below%3A+Locating+the+underground+in+post-World+War+II+American+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vlagopoulos%2C+Penny&amp;isbn=9780549858751&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.396597948,0.925317653,1287,Mixed,political participation,Ikhwan Movement in Arabia and Nicaragua ICC suit against the US,"The utility and efficacy of human materialism as an anthropological research strategy for the analysis of sociocultural, economic, and political history","The purpose of this dissertation is to answer four principal questions: (1) are sociocultural systems a proper domain for research utilizing a research strategy founded in scientific principles?; (2) does the anthropological research strategy, Human Materialism, posses sufficient analytical power to address questions arising in the research of sociocultural systems?; (3) can Human Materialism be extended or enriched to improve its efficacy and power in the study of sociocultural systems? (4) The answer to all four of these questions is yes. Human Materialism is an anthropological research strategy based in scientific principles and presenting a universal model of sociocultural systems. The universal model is comprised of an infrastructure, a structure, and a superstructure. The infrastructure is further divided into material, human, and social infrastructural components. The material infrastructure contains the modes of production, technology, tools among other elements. The human infrastructure contains demographic factors such as population, fertility and so on. The social infrastructure contains effective ownership and control of the forces of production as well as persons in positions of political and economic power and their positions. The social structure includes all social organization: family and kinship, as well as political and economic organization and so on. The social infrastructure overlaps and extends into the social structure. This is the location where those persons with political and economic power direct and control cultural transactions. The superstructure contains all ideological components including religion, philosophy, symbols, and rituals among other elements. The author has extended the concept of faction in Human Materialist analysis to include three types of factions and two statuses. Faction types are simple, bridging, or shifting according to their sociocultural role. I classify factions that have been coerced into compliance with the persons of political and economic power as having the status of annexed. I classify all other factions as having voluntary status. Simple factions are voluntary and may be tightly organized or loosely organized. Bridging factions are the most powerful type faction and possess enough political power to bridge over other factions and bind them to the persons of political and economic power who control the bridging faction. Shifting factions are those that shift their loyalty or political influence from one interest to another. Factions take on greater or lesser power and influence in sociocultural systems depending on their manipulation by political and economic leaders or by the mitigation of such manipulation by other participants in the system. The above methodological elements are demonstrated by numerous case studies. These case studies begin with the Ikhwan Movement in Arabia and the case of Nicaraguaâ€™s 1984 suit against the United States in the International Court of Justice. The cases then proceed to Jacob Housman and Indian Key to 19 th century Sioux law and finally to terrorism. Regarding terrorism the author recounts his 40 year journey in his quest to understand terrorism. This journey proceeds from the narrow thinking of the young deputy to the more mature thinking of the older anthropologist. The author presents the first ever Human Materialist theory of terrorism. This theory posits that the collision between a state and a terrorist group is really about the struggle over entry into control over the social infrastructure. This is because it is the social infrastructure where the persons of political and economic power reside and where their control of the sociocultural system is directed.

Although they did not succeed, they in part foreshadowed, in part initiated changes that transformed European society and political culture in the following decades. As the uprisings came to an end, revolutionaries of various political convictions and social backgrounds left their home countries, creating the most heterogeneous wave of political exile in the nineteenth century. While the collective and European dimensions of the 1848 revolutions are widely studied, this is rarely done for the political exile that followed. This dissertation takes a prosopographical approach to examine the social and cultural impact of political exile following the 1848 revolutions in a transnational setting. The trajectories of Ã©migrÃ©s from the German lands (mainly Baden and WÃ¼rttemberg) and from Hungary in four host societies (Switzerland, England, the United States and the Ottoman Empire) provide the framework for studying exile as a pan-European and global phenomenon. Using correspondences, diaries, memoirs, petitions for clemency, court records and government documents, the dissertation explores case studies of Ã©migrÃ©s from various social and educational backgrounds. While exile is often considered an individual challenge, this dissertation studies its collective aspects; in particular, it locates the experience of exile in three realms: family, employment and social networks. Exploring the interconnectedness of these three areas yields insights into the ways in which new realities confronted old patterns of social and political interaction in mid-nineteenth century Europe. The expansion of the social and ideological spectrum of political movements resulted in stricter asylum practices, while host countries maintained the rhetoric of open borders. With newly-gained confidence in political participation, families effectively lobbied for amnesty for their loved ones while appealing to the monarch's ""fatherly love,"" using the language of the pre-revolutionary era. Unwilling labor migrants, Ã©migrÃ©s had to adapt skills that had earned them social prestige at home to the realities of the international labor market. Similar tensions characterized Ã©migrÃ©s' social networks and their decision to return from exile. Instigators yet also victims of the changes taking place around them, Ã©migrÃ©s formed an emblematic group within Europe in the mid-nineteenth century.",304600387,,Dissertations & Theses," Toth, HelenaTothHelenaToth, Helena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1617327661 , 40045101 , 66569 , 9780549882411 , 3334807 , 3334807", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304600387?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Germans , Germany, history, 19th century , Hungarians , Hungary, history, 19th century , Migration , Migration, 19th century , Political exile , Political exile, 19th century , Revolution of 1848",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%C3%89migr%C3%A9s%3A+The+experience+of+political+exile+for%0AGermans+and+Hungarians%2C+1848%E2%80%931871&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Toth%2C+Helena&amp;isbn=9780549882411&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.883778888,0.959413288,93,Right,political participation,how the internet deployment affects political participation of social and political activists,Internet use among social and political activists: A Kingston case study,"There has been much debate between enthusiastic and sceptical scholars about the role of the internet in traditional and non-traditional political organizations. The former argue that this medium benefits smaller, resource-poor and non-traditional organizations more than powerful, resource-rich traditional political parties. The latter hold that the internet, instead of levelling the playing field between traditional and non-traditional political players, reinforces the power of the existing, dominant political elites. Both perspectives by and large assume that the effects of internet technology are self-actualizing. To address this debate, this dissertation examines how the internet deployment affects political participation of social and political activists. It focuses on political party executives from constituency-level party organizations as well as social activists from several social movements in Kingston. More specifically, this work analyzes the fashion in which internet technology contributes to activists' political engagement and their attempts to widen the influence of their organizations. In addition, the thesis looks at the extent to which the net prompted activists' political initiation. The social movements on which this work concentrates are: Amnesty International (Kingston and Queen's chapters), Pesticide Reduction Kingston (PRK), the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG), and Queen's Project for International Development (QPID). The following political parties are analyzed here: the Liberal Party (federal and provincial constituency-level organizations), the Progressive Conservative Party (federal and provincial constituency-level organizations), the Canadian Alliance, the New Democratic Party (NDP), and the Green Party (Kingston Greens). The thesis maintains that internet technology does not have its own momentum and logic in shaping political outcomes. The study advances the argument that outcomes depend more decisively upon the use of this technology than on properties inherent in it. It argues that, to the extent to which the internet is enabling, it is conditioned by human choices, organizational context and culture. The study demonstrates that, while the centralized nature and the organizational culture of the political parties examined tend to restrict certain types of internet applications, it is the decentralized and networked culture of Kingston social movements which incites social activists to invest more effort in specific online strategies; namely, maintaining their websites, building activist networks, and generating participants' empowerment.",304784127,,Dissertations & Theses," Zizic, BojanaZizicBojanaZizic, Bojana", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1335364851 , 36587141 , 66569 , 9780494266649 , NR26664 , NR26664", Dissertation/Thesis,2007,9.78E+12, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304784127?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media"," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media"," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media",," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass media"," Political science , Mass media , Internet , Social change , Activists , Case studies , Kingston Ontario Canada"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Internet , Kingston , Ontario , Political activism , Social activists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Internet+use+among+social+and+political+activists%3A+A+Kingston+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zizic%2C+Bojana&amp;isbn=9780494266649&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.868963475,0.997809068,3540,Left,religious,liberation theology,Church and politics in the theology of Jose Miguez-Bonino and Allan Boesak.,"Since the early 1970s, many Christians have come to the realisation that the churches world-wide have a profound impact on the shaping of a nation's socio-economic and political agenda. Issues and debates within the Church are shaped by the interplay between intra-Church theological and ecclesiastical concerns and national/international ideological and institutional patterns to which churches must adapt. Newly emerging socio-political situations, such as the emergence of democracy in South Africa, complicate the Church's continued search for its prophetic voice: What does it mean to have a concern for social justice, peace, and to maintain a ""preferential option for the poor"" when the world's political order is continually in transition? This thesis explores the debates that surround the Church's relationship to politics by focusing on the contemporary theological movement known as ""liberation theology"" and objections that have been raised by its more conservative and liberal opponents. It specifically examines and compares the way Jose Miguez-Bonino from Latin America and Allan Boesak from South Africa, have responded to the theological challenges set by their surrounding social realities and how they have answered the criticisms from Europe and North America. We argue that the theology of these two men offers a more adequate understanding of the relationship between Church, theology, and politics than their critics because of the importance Miguez-Bonino and Boesak give to a praxis that reflects the needs of the poor and oppressed.",301549822,,Dissertations & Theses," Poit, J.C.PoitJ.C.Poit, J.C.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757638801 , 44660211 , 101309 , U088818 , U088818", Dissertation/Thesis,1997,, English, English,,1997,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1997,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301549822?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology,, 0469 Theology, Theology," (UMI)AAIU088818 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Church+and+politics+in+the+theology+of+Jose+Miguez-Bonino+and+Allan+Boesak.&amp;issn=&amp;date=1997-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Poit%2C+J.C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.197583667,0.977133877,1608,Left,religious,Christian nonviolence,"From pacifism to nonviolent direct action: The fellowship of reconciliation and social Christianity, 1914-1947","This project traces the development of Christian nonviolence in the United States from the outbreak of World War I until just after World War II by focusing on one Christian pacifist organization. The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), organized in 1915 in opposition to World War I, embraced the left wing of the prewar social gospel and fused its radical vision for social reconstruction with their opposition to war. Over the next thirty years, Christian pacifists associated with the Fellowship applied their energies not only to ending international war but also to promoting reconciliation between employers and workers in the struggle for labor justice and ending racial discrimination. During this period, advocates of nonviolence struggled to define a practical means for applying the principles of Christian pacifism. In contrast to older histories of the interwar period, this study shows that pacifism, a central concern for liberal Protestants during that period, shaped the broader American tradition of dissent. It also rejects the notion that the Christian ""realists,"" led by Reinhold Niebuhr, offered the only comprehensive Christian social ethic between the wars. Finally, this dissertation shows how Christian pacifists in the interwar period embraced and adapted the principles Gandhian nonviolence to the American scene. Members of the Fellowship founded the Congress of Racial Equality in Chicago in 1942 and developed methods of nonviolent direct action that were adopted by advocates for racial equality during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s..",1500435448,,Dissertations & Theses," Ballou, Andrew J.BallouJ.AndrewBallou, Andrew J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3223069671 , 80581202 , 66569 , 9781303702426 , 3610449 , 3610449", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1500435448?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," Religious history , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christianity , Civil rights movement , Gandhi , Nonviolence , Pacifism , Social gospel",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+pacifism+to+nonviolent+direct+action%3A+The+fellowship+of+reconciliation+and+social+Christianity%2C+1914-1947&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ballou%2C+Andrew+J.&amp;isbn=9781303702426&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.089425115,0.954204541,3236,Left,religious,Buddhist movement for personal self-realization and saving our planet through collective action,&lt;i&gt;SÅka Gakkai&lt;/i&gt;: A contemporary social movement,"SÅka Gakkai International (SGI), a lay-Buddhist organization, draws on the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin, a 13 th century Japanese monk who believed that material and spiritual fulfillment could be attained through faith in the Lotus Sutra.

Since its beginning in 1930, SGI has created itself as a global movement with goals of personal self-realization and saving our planet through collective action. It promotes these ideals through education and cultural programs. Critics argue that the organization's considerable wealth and power indicate that its apparent altruism hides a darker side.

Following his lead, the Federal Council of Churches conducted a successful campaign in support of world order and peace. Their strategy to focus on informing public opinion about international co-operation proved effective in drawing the United States away form the isolationism that had rejected Wilson's League of Nations and towards participation in the United Nations Organisation. The willing acceptance of America to play a leading role in the community of nations was deemed by many Church leaders an indispensable step towards the future realisation of the Kingdom of God on earth. At the World Conference of Life and Work in Oxford (1937), John Foster Dulles and Alfred E. Zimmern, a member of the British Round Table Group, stepped into the forefront of the ecumenical movement to set down the Church's internationalist and social policies, most notably in the Oxford report on 'The Universal Church and the World of Nations'. The Round Table Group was formed in Britain, and its dominions, at around 1910. Its principal leaders, Lionel G. Curtis and Philip Kerr, became outstanding proponents of the imperial federation movement and later of a federal 'world commonwealth'. To further their objectives, Curtis and Kerr played an instrumental role in establishing the Institute of International Affairs at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Members of the American delegation, such as John Foster Dulles and Whitney H. Shepardson, joined them in the endeavour. Disillusioned about the outcome of the Peace Conference, they decided to promote, in their respective countries, the ideal of a unified world.

In the quest for a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, most scholarly attention has been focused on the state (and people) of Israel and the people of Palestine. As a result, we have focused too little attention on the role of support for U.S. nationalism in the American Jewish community in sustaining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I argue that a critical juncture in this process occurred in the early twentieth century, as the United States emerged as an international power. Many of the early leaders of Americanized Zionism, such as Horace M. Kallen and Justice Louis Brandeis, began their careers as Progressive reformers and brought their ideas about social and political action with them into the Zionist movement. Brandeis in particular played a critical role in making Zionism acceptable to American Jews. As this Americanized version of Zionism has become normalized in American Jewish life, the principle of Jewish sovereignty has become widely understood among American Jews to be an essential guarantor of Jewish safety. To understand the roots and implications of this stance, I explore the genealogy of the idea of sovereignty, as well as the binary opposition of â€œArabsâ€ and â€œJewsâ€ in Euro-American thought. Americanized Zionism, I conclude, is less a product of Jewish ethnicity or religion than enactment of a commitment to U.S. nationalism as a fundamental aspect of American Jewish identity.",1794167069,,Dissertations & Theses," Kamel, RachaelKamelRachaelKamel, Rachael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4079399391 , 105208512 , 66569 , 9781339745411 , 10111332 , 10111332", Dissertation/Thesis,2016,9.78E+12, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794167069?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," Religion , American studies , Peace Studies , Judaic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American studies , Cultural studies , Jewish studies , Nationalism , Progressivism , Zionism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Thinking+Beyond+Identity%2C+Nationalism%2C+and+Empire&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kamel%2C+Rachael&amp;isbn=9781339745411&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.488747704,0.989717715,2908,Mixed,religious,international Charismatic Movement of Ireland,Reconciling Belfast: The politics of faith and peace in Northern Ireland,"This dissertation investigates the local political effects of the international Charismatic movement in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In Belfast, the historical alignment of religious affiliation, cultural heritage, and political allegiance has produced a division between two ethnic communities: Roman Catholics and Protestants. This binary has been consequential over the past thirty years, contributing to the low-intensity sectarian war in which the political future of Ireland is contested. The degree to which the sectarianism is a fundamental structuring principal of society in Belfast is reflected in the exclusion from public discourse of other dimensions of social difference, such as socioeconomic class, and socioreligious plurality. Rooted in endogamy, divisions between the communities is sustained by mutually-exclusive, stereotyping practices that include residential and educational segregation, various religious, cultural, and political practices, sundry acts of violence and terrorism (or the tacit support of these), and other discursive strategies that isolate â€œusâ€ from â€œthem.â€ The role of religion in this process remains under-investigated, despite its apparent centrality. I argue that a distinction must be made between popular faith and religious orthodoxy. Charismatic Renewal in Belfast is a revitalization movement wherein middle-class citizens ritually dramatize â€œreconciliationâ€ between the two communities. Such drama re-constructs personal and social identity by performing what participants consider to be pan-Christian ethics, worldview, and embodied or effervescent experience. These stand in opposition to the orthodox, post-Enlightenment rationalist practices of the traditional Christian denominations. In so doing, Renewal empowers people who might otherwise have little influence on changing an atavistic and remorselessly violent social order.

By conducting some 14 months ethnographic fieldwork in northern Alberta (primarily Trout Lake and Peerless Lake), I have begun to study this religion in its social context. Using ethnographic and historical methods, I trace the development of Cree Pentecostalism from sect to majority status. I also assess the function of the Cree language, and attend to the role of discourse in general, in Cree Pentecostal worship. I examine the relationship between Pentecostal conversion and other trends and movements in Cree society, and document the relationship between Pentecostal practice and that of other religious networks. By conducting most of my fieldwork in Trout Lake, a community where census data indicate that Pentecostals are in the majority, I am able to consider Pentecostals as more than a fringe group, while also querying whether or not Pentecostalism actually is the majority religion in the community. I take a tripartite approach, using the classical cultural-historical approach of Boasian anthropology, combined with the broad scope of relevant data seen in the interpretive turn of Geertz, Turner, and Douglas, as amplified by Hymes, Tedlock and others under the rubric of discourse analysis; thirdly, I open up the intellectual scope of the thesis to emphasize experiences of the spiritual as well as discourses about spiritual ideasâ€”in this way I emphasize the description of cultural and personal transformations, set firmly within the context of holism and interpretive thick description, as the cutting edge of ethnographic practice. Using scholarly literature from global Pentecostalism and North American Christianity, including works by Cox, Meyer, Lawless, Titon, Luhrmann, and Harding, I suggest that Pentecostal practice depends on learning a new linguistic register, and overall is strongly dependant on discourse and genre. This opens the door to assessing how Christian practices interact with or translate local culture and meaning systems. In assessing these questions I assess theoretical perspectives developed by Sahlins, Thompson, Dombrowski, Preston, Laugrand, Robbins, Schieffelin, Goulet, Philips Valentine, and others.",304408355,,Dissertations & Theses," Westman, Clinton NormanWestmanNormanClintonWestman, Clinton Norman", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1678418211 , 42314901 , 66569 , 9780494464526 , NR46452 , NR46452", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304408355?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Alberta , Cree , Pentecostalism , Religious discourse",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+Cree+religious+discourse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westman%2C+Clinton+Norman&amp;isbn=9780494464526&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.110049855,0.981712528,1563,Right,religious,Catholicism; anti-communism,"The Vatican and the Making of the Atlantic Order, 1920â€“1960","Historians have traditionally paid little attention to the influence of institutional Catholicism in shaping the international state system in the twentieth century. This dissertation argues that the Vatican played a crucial role in facilitating the rise of anti-liberal and anti-socialist political movements after World War I, and in laying the foundations for the emergence of the Cold War Atlantic Order after 1945. Following its loss of the Papal States in 1870, the Vatican fought to regain influence on the European continent by pioneering a new form of treaty diplomacy and by launching a transnational anticommunist campaign with broad appeal. These actions enabled the Vatican to seize a prominent place in European affairs, and integrate elements of its vision of state-society relations within the legal, economic and social framework of nearly a dozen European states. The Vatican's interwar gains led it to partner during World War II with the United States and Christian Democratic leaders, forging an alliance that would contribute decisively to Europe's moral and material reconstruction, and shape the emergent Cold War Atlantic alliance.",1357151664,,Dissertations & Theses," Chamedes, GiulianaChamedesGiulianaChamedes, Giuliana", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2984430751 , 79244872 , 66569 , 9781303068904 , 3560636 , 3560636", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1357151664?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history"," Religious history , European history , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Catholicism , Communism , Europe , Philosophy , Religion and theology , United States , Vatican",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Vatican+and+the+Making+of+the+Atlantic+Order%2C+1920%E2%80%931960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chamedes%2C+Giuliana&amp;isbn=9781303068904&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.470130943,0.954805877,2826,Right,religious,Student Christian Movement,"Women's leadership roles in the Student Christian Movement and the rise of the new woman, 1880-1920","At first glance, two components of late Victorian, Anglo-American society stand in stark contrast to each other: the image of the New Woman, and the women leaders of the Student Christian Movement (SCM). Popularized in the press, drama, and periodicals and reflected in the lives of real women, the New Woman appeared to revolt against the dominant social order by her independence, college-education, athleticism, cigar-smoking, disdain for marriage and irreligious or anti-religious attitudes. The SCM's women leaders, in theory, epitomized mainstream society. These women were connected with major Christian bodies and centers of political and social power. They helped direct the first international, interdenominational society for Christian students. By World War I, their mainstream organization was the largest student organization in the world. Out of their movement sprang some of the twentieth century's most influential Christian movements. The special claim of this dissertation is that the image of the New Woman and the SCM's women leaders are not opposites, but in fact, have many common traits. I will demonstrate that the most significant connection between the two is that the SCM's women leaders were, in effect, New Women. Because this study recognizes the importance of cultural contextualization and the reciprocity between the environment and specific individuals, chapter one surveys the development and features of these two facets in the context of late Victorian life. Chapters two through four explores the various leadership roles assumed by SCM women with special reference to mixed or men-only groups. Using the data from chapters one through four, chapter five discusses the connections between the New Woman and the SCM's women leaders. Chapter six, the conclusion, adds non-white, non-Anglo-Saxon, fashionably dressed, social feminist and religious images to the established version of the New Woman. It expands what is known about SCM women leaders by providing information on their background, education, and approaches to marriage and career. Inherent in this project is the proposal that religion and feminism have connections that have not been explored, but which can contribute to understanding turn-of-the-century Protestantism and the women's movement.",304539152,,Dissertations & Theses," Russell, Thomas ArthurRussellArthurThomasRussell, Thomas Arthur", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 733508961 , 30969231 , 66569 , 9780599339828 , 0599339829 , 9933272 , 9933272", Dissertation/Thesis,1999," 9780599339828 , 0599339829", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304539152?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Religious history , Womens studies , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Leadership , New woman , Student Christian Movement , Women's leadership",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women%27s+leadership+roles+in+the+Student+Christian+Movement+and+the+rise+of+the+new+woman%2C+1880-1920&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Russell%2C+Thomas+Arthur&amp;isbn=9780599339828&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.656704154,0.952375189,2218,Right,religious,evangelical mission strategies. Followers of two movementsâ€”Power Evangelism and Signs and Wonders,Geographies of Prayer: Place and Religion in Modern America,"The built environment has been a focus of the study of sacred space for decades. This dissertation examines late twentieth-century evangelical religious practices to show the construction of mobile, geographical, and imagined sacred spaces. The study thus identifies ways that space and spatial logic have become integral to the development of contemporary religion. As the narrative recounts, by the late 1970s increasingly charismatic elements could be seen in mainstream evangelical mission strategies. Followers of two movementsâ€”Power Evangelism and Signs and Wondersâ€”claimed they received spiritual gifts that were effective tools for church growth. A number, calling themselves spiritual warriors, began to emphasize their participation in a battle between God and Satan as a precondition for successful evangelism, and in this context mobile practices like prayerwalking became popular as spiritual warfare. In the global March For Jesus praise movement, warriors found that leaving the physical space of a church provided them better access to the sacred spaces most integral to their religious goals. Obstacles to evangelism were often interpreted as the product of territorial demons. This led not only to new practices of mapping that pinpointed the location of demonic strongholds, but also to new conceptions of the world. For spiritual warriors, cultural problems from the past, such as disputes with indigenous peoples, became the source of present-day social problems. Proponents said they were discerning spiritual landscapes hidden in time and space, and then they mapped the results on contemporary places. Finally, as the dissertation argues, the city has been a persistent backdrop for spiritual warfare. Evangelists saw danger and opportunity in the world's growing urbanism. They also focused on the Bible's many urban references. Cities were not only Babylons doomed to God's judgment. They were also Jerichos for God's army to conquer or Jerusalems waiting to be transformed by the coming Kingdom of God.",1448527075,,Dissertations & Theses," McConeghy, David WalkerMcConeghyWalkerDavidMcConeghy, David Walker", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3117893251 , 78954772 , 66569 , 9781303426285 , 3596197 , 3596197", Dissertation/Thesis,2013,9.78E+12, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448527075?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion,, 0318 Religion, Religion," Philosophy, religion and theology , American religious history , Evangelicalism , Sacred space , Spiritual warfare",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Geographies+of+Prayer%3A+Place+and+Religion+in+Modern+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McConeghy%2C+David+Walker&amp;isbn=9781303426285&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.462209181,0.950216663,1713,Right,religious,Pentecostal movement in the global South,Socioeconomic status and prosperity belief in Guatemala,"A popular belief in the exploding Pentecostal movement in the global South is the idea that if an individual has enough faith, God will bless them with financial prosperity. Although historically Pentecostalism has been identified as a religion of the poor, this study examines recent arguments that the current Pentecostal movement in Guatemala is a religion of the socially mobile middle and elite classes. Data from the Pew Forum on Religious and Public Lifeâ€™s 2006 survey Spirit and Power: Survey of Pentecostals in Guatemala is used to conduct a logistic regression, in order to measure the effects of socioeconomic status on adherence to prosperity belief. Results suggest that, contrary to the current literature on Guatemalan Pentecostalism, prosperity belief is not necessarily concentrated among the upwardly mobile middle and upper classes, but rather is widely diffused across social strata, and in particular, among those that have lower levels of education.

Though Egypt's current economic crisis is a main focus of international attention, President Morsi and the ruling regime's strategies to deadlock worker's reform initiatives remain largely unacknowledged. This paper provides two crucial explanations for this phenomenon that are insufficiently addressed by current social movement theories. The first concerns (1) the misrepresentation of the Muslim Brotherhood in current scholarship as a philanthropic organization and thus, an actor with interests congruent with the working/poorer classes, and secondly, (2) the regime's ability to suppress labor reforms while simultaneously instituting a facade of democratic measures to curtail criticism. I begin by providing an alternative narrative of the Muslim Brotherhood's trajectory that challenges a dominant framework prevalent with inaccuracies about their political motivations, and thus their relationship to social justice issues more broadly.

Influenced by evangelical Protestant religious revivals, American women committed to serve non-White women and children in their home country as well as in non-European areas of the world, including China. This dissertation challenges the dominant missionary notion underlying ""woman's work for woman,"" which presumes a binary understanding of women as either givers or takers and reinforces the essentialization of ""woman"" as a category. In actuality, both women missionaries and local women contributed to local women's work in the expansion of global Christianity at the turn of the century. Through a regional study of Christian women's work at the Canton Mission of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (later on merged into the Church of Christ in China) from 1847 to 1938, this dissertation demonstrates the dynamic intercultural cooperation and negotiations of ""women's work for women"" between and among Chinese Christian women and women missionaries. Significantly, it affirms that women missionaries and newly empowered Chinese Christian women formed a negotiable space for ""women's work for women,"" providing educational, social, and medical services, as well as evangelizing work for Chinese women in Canton, South China. This study demonstrates the multiple agencies in these two categories of women, in response to changing contexts in the US and in China. Adding to other biographical and institutional studies, this dissertation examines the network of the local Christian women's community, which expanded through denominational and interdenominational ties, social (between alma mater and alumna), and individual (both natal and marital families, and intergenerational connections), as well as national and transnational relationships.",1734684653,,Dissertations & Theses," Wong, Wai-Yin ChristinaWongChristinaWai-YinWong, Wai-Yin Christina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3871682971 , 100310052 , 66569 , 9781339233970 , 3664449 , 3664449", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734684653?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0293 African Studies , 0320 Religious history , 0453 Womens studies"," African Studies , Religious history , Womens studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Canton (Guangzhou) China , Chinese Christianity , Presbyterian Church in the USA Local Christian Women's Community , Women and Missions , Women's Work for Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women%27s+work+for+women%3A+Chinese+Christian+women+and+Western+missionaries+in+Canton%2C+South+China%2C+1847%E2%80%931938&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wong%2C+Wai-Yin+Christina&amp;isbn=9781339233970&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.975262136,0.903097995,3455,Right,religious,"ASI (Association of Privately Owned Seventh-day Adventist Services and Industries) in the United States of America, and second, to develop an approach for the establishment of ASI chapters in the Tanzania Union Mission of Seventh-day Adventists",The establishment of ASI chapters in Tanzania,"Statement of project . The purposes of this project were first, to study the multifaceted aspects and the importance of ASI (Association of Privately Owned Seventh-day Adventist Services and Industries) in the United States of America, and second, to develop an approach for the establishment of ASI chapters in the Tanzania Union Mission of Seventh-day Adventists. Method . To accomplish the above purposes, primary sources of information were consulted, such as a survey of ASI and other relevant literature including ASI audio and video tapes in order to discover the historical background and cultural setting of ASI. The development of the self-supporting movement of the Seventh-day Adventist church from 1904â€“1947 and the recent trends from 1947 to the present have been described using the primary sources and supplemented through interviews and discussions with ASI leaders. Furthermore, the contributions of ASI to the Seventh-day Adventist church in the areas of home and mission projects and denominational structure (the means of revival) have been investigated. The second part of this study outlines the national and church conditions that justify the establishment of ASI chapters in Tanzania. Study has been given to the ways ASI chapters in Tanzania could help the Global Mission of the Seventh-day Adventist church. Such areas include health projects, improvement of the Tanzania Seminary and College, creation of scholarship funds by businessmen, improving small farms, nutrition seminars, training of lay people in witnessing techniques, and developing appropriate social centers. Summary, conclusions, and recommendations complete the whole study. Expectations from the project . The foremost expectation of this project was, is, and will be (1)Â the development of ASI chapters in Tanzania, (2)Â the involvement of more members in Global Mission projects and activities, giving Adventist lay people a sense of identity outside of their usual business associations and clubs, (3)Â increasing the public's awareness of the Seventhday Adventist church, and (4)Â the development of another resource for the furthering of God's work in Tanzania.

Findings from Ezra, Nehemiah and John Wesley helped form a lens through which ethnographic interviews of three Ugandan leaders in government, business and the church were analyzed. Biblical theology of mission, historical research, and grounded theory were primary methods utilized. Secondary methods were used in each case, where appropriate. The findings verify that prayer is central to Kingdom advance and shed light on the process, principles and patterns related to the role of prayer in bringing godly transformation to social systems. These suggest ways to strengthen the Body of Christ's prayer life and its transformational capacity.

The first chapter surveys the home-base of the missionaries from the four different nationalities and suggests that the common theological orientation of the missionaries was orthodox Presbyterianism and Evangelicalism. Some other formative factors from the home-bases were the emphases on education, commerce or development, social responsibility, and the sense of duty in the spread of â€œcivilization.â€ Those features, in general, shaped the â€œsuperiorityâ€ of both Christianity and Western civilization in the mind and practice of the Presbyterian missionaries. The second chapter shows that the missionaries pursued unity within the Presbyterian tradition, cooperation and comity along with the churches in other traditions and the missionary societies, and the development of an indigenous Presbytery or Church both in Manchuria and the rest of China. The missionaries, however, also maintained their narrow-mindedness in unity, a reluctance in divesting themselves of the responsibilities for the Church of Manchuria, and a hostile attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church. In encountering Chinese religions, they generally held the position that the Chinese religions were â€œpaganâ€ or â€œsuperstitiousâ€ and that Christianity was superior to them. However, a few missionaries tried to understand those religions from an historical point of view and affirm some aspects of their spirituality. They thereby hoped to see the emergence of a Chinese Christianity with Chinese religious and cultural characteristics. The third chapter investigates the ways in which the missionaries worked among immigrants, refugees and the sick. The period that the missionaries worked in Southern Manchuria was also a time in which massive migrations from North China, Korea, and Japan to Manchuria were made. It was also a time when China, Russia, and Japan were competing with one another for the dominance in East Asia. This resulted in a couple of international wars mainly in Southern Manchuria. The missionaries were faced with a considerable number of immigrants and refugees as a result of the wars. The desperate needs of the people in Southern Manchuria helped the missionaries change their mission methods and dedicate themselves to relief, development, and some other types of activities to improve the conditions of the people's life. Whereas the other three nationalities dealt mainly with the marginalized, the American missionaries who worked among the Japanese in the Kwantung Leased Territory in Manchuria had a different context in encountering the (semi)-colonizers. The last chapter analyzes the missionaries' political and â€˜politically neutralâ€™ stances made in response to national events. Experiencing the Boxer Uprising of 1900 and the May Thirtieth Incident of 1925, the British missionaries came to be sympathetic to Chinese nationalism and expressed their willingness to abandon the political rights of Christian missions coming out of the unequal treaties. Korean missionaries joined the anti-colonial movement in Manchuria as contributing to nationalistic education. In addition, facing the crisis of the Korean immigrants' survival in the midst of the competing Chinese and Japanese nationalisms in Manchuria, some Korean missionaries participated in the naturalization movement for Chinese citizenship. Some American missionaries saw the bilingual and bicultural ability in many Koreans residing in Manchuria. They hoped to mobilize them for the evangelization of the Chinese. The American missionaries among the Japanese in Manchuria had the attitude of â€˜political neutrality.â€™ However, they were, especially in the early period of their work, considerably dependent on the financial support of the Japanese Kwantung Government. In the conclusion, the author suggests that the direction for the future study of Christianity in Manchuria should be indigenization and contextualization of the Church. He also suggests the direction for trans-nationality in encouraging the study of Christianity among the minority ethnic groups in Manchuria and the study of the transnational expressions between and among the different groups.",304625138,,Dissertations & Theses," Park, Hyung ShinParkShinHyungPark, Hyung Shin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1617383961 , 41432721 , 66569 , 9780549887133 , 3335279 , 3335279", Dissertation/Thesis,2008,9.78E+12, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304625138?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History",," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History"," Religious history , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , China , Evangelicalism , Indigenization , Manchuria , Missions , Presbyterian , Presbyterianism , Trans-nationality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Presbyterian+missionaries+in+Southern+Manchuria%2C+1867%E2%80%931931%3A+Religion%2C+society%2C+and+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Park%2C+Hyung+Shin&amp;isbn=9780549887133&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.487027454,0.926154975,1729,Unknown,religious,Islamic Revivalism,"Producing Islam: &lt;i&gt;Da'wa&lt;/i&gt; and television in the ""New Egypt""","This dissertation is an ethnography of how new ways of being Islamic become possible and compelling through transnational media technologies, the globalized media cultures they enable, and their attendant sensory politics. It asks what does it mean to ""produce Islam""â€”both as a media form and in the broader social senseâ€”through exploring the intersections of satellite television and religion in Egypt. Iqraa, the world's first self-declared Islamic television channel, was launched in 1998. Since then, the Islamic satellite sector has increased dramatically with dozens of channels competing for viewers across the Middle East and beyond. Iqraa, however, stands out for first producing the controversial programs of Egypt's ""New Preachers"" ( al-du'ah al-gudud ), so named because their styles of performance and media aesthetics are unprecedented within the country's piety movement. The forms of religious media created by the New Preachers and their affiliated television producers straddle distinct standards of moral probity, commercial success, and sensuous pleasure. Drawing on 31 months of fieldwork in Cairo with Iqraa producers and viewers, this study tracks how Islamic television has become a key site of struggle over religious authority, moral distinction, and cultural authenticity within the country's long-standing Islamic Revival. I argue that at stake in these internal contestations is not just the creation of novel forms of religious media, but also alternative imaginations of what religiosity entails, how it should be cultivated, and to what collective ends. Examining the intersections of Islam and televisual media in a revolutionary context troubles the utility of a secular-religious binary for understanding both the country's turbulent trajectory since the 2011 uprising and the struggles of Islamic Revivalists to create the ""New Egypt.""",1666862623,,Dissertations & Theses," Moll, YasminMollYasminMoll, Yasmin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3636478071 , 94994182 , 66569 , 9781321624366 , 3685892 , 3685892", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1666862623?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Communication , Middle Eastern Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Egypt , Islam , Media , Preaching , Religion , Television",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Producing+Islam%3A+Da%27wa+and+television+in+the%0A%22New+Egypt%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moll%2C+Yasmin&amp;isbn=9781321624366&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.99914946,0.958280356,700,Unknown,religious,Pakistan's islamic movements; global Islamic revival ,"The semiotics of revivalist Islam: Women, space, and stories in Pakistan's islamic movements","Large numbers of urban Pakistani women are adopting sartorial and behavioral markers associated with the global Islamic revival and are participating in Islamic revivalist movements. Many Pakistanis find this increase troubling, and feel that it betokens an increase in ""extremism"" in Pakistan. Women's participation in these movements is controversial, and results in conflicts with their families, friends, and social networks. As they participate in revivalist movements, women are introduced to Islamic sacred texts (the Qur'an and Hadith), which movement leadership interpret in ways that support the reformist mission of their particular movement. Revivalist leaders draw on Islamic sacred texts to promote visions of a pure Islamic society, and call on women to restrict their spending and socialization habits, and to reject many aspects of Pakistani society as ""un-Islamic."" This dissertation examines women's participation in Islamic revivalism in Pakistan through a focus on women's participation in the Tablighi Jama'at and the Al-Huda Welfare Trust. The relative gendered composition of these movements makes a comparative approach particularly instructive; the Tablighi Jama'at is a male-led movement which incorporates women as accessories, while Al-Huda is female-led and was founded exclusively for women. These movements, and Pakistani reactions to them, illustrate Pakistani beliefs regarding gender, purified religion, and ideas of culture. A study of these movements speaks to theoretical concerns regarding the Islamic revival as a global movement, and to the role of the religious resurgence in Pakistan. I explore these movements through the following guiding questions: (1) Are women's experiences in women-led movements different from those that are strongly male-centered?; (2) how do the differences among revivalist movements impact women's learning experience and utilization of sacred texts within and outside revivalist settings?; (3) to what extent do women contribute to the revivalist theology and ideology that guides their lives? Is this process different based on the movement a woman joins?; and (4) how does revivalism impact the social landscape of urban Pakistan? Two unifying analytical themes run through this dissertation and provide a framework through which I answer my research questions. The first is an examination of the contestations and discourses surrounding gendered piety, and the ways in which these confrontations delineate the urban Pakistani discursive field. The second theme concerns meaning-making within the Tablighi Jama'at and Al-Huda, and interrogates the processes through which revivalist knowledges are created and maintained. My dissertation traces the processes through which revivalist subjects emerge, with a focus on the ways in which revivalist women contribute to the discourses which form their subjecthood and subjectivities. I argue that women's agency is not limited to their self-creation as subjects, but extends to their participation in the creation of the discourses to which they subject themselves. My research reveals that female members of the Tablighi Jama'at and Al-Huda create movement structures and messages through their participation in these movements, actively contributing to revivalist ideology and meaning. The mechanisms of women's contributions are similar across movements, and women in both movements contribute significantly to the revivalist discourse, rhetoric, and theology they adopt.",1564227997,,Dissertations & Theses," Zaman, Meryem FatimaZamanFatimaMeryemZaman, Meryem Fatima", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3440018621 , 87773542 , 66569 , 9781321092790 , 3631026 , 3631026", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564227997?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Gender studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Gender , Islam , Pakistan , Revivalism , Social class",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+semiotics+of+revivalist+Islam%3A+Women%2C+space%2C+and+stories+in+Pakistan%27s+islamic+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zaman%2C+Meryem+Fatima&amp;isbn=9781321092790&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.636629187,0.957383447,1188,Unknown,religious,YMCA secretary George Fisher,Missionary millennium: The American West; North and West Africa in the Christian imagination,"During the 1890s in the United States, Midwestern YMCA missionaries challenged the nexus of power between Northeastern Protestant denominations, industrialists, politicians, and the Associationâ€™s International Committee.

This dissertation explores the modern resurgence of daâ€˜wa â€”â€œinvitingâ€ to Islam, or Islamic missionary activityâ€”through the lens of inter-religious relations, and within the two horizons Islamic history and modernity. It demonstrates, first, the close relationship that has existed between daâ€˜wa and inter-religious relations both in the past and in the modern period. Second, it sheds light on the diversity of daâ€˜wa in the midst of other religions by tracing two broad styles of daâ€˜wa throughout Islamic history: â€œbottom-upâ€ and â€œtop-downâ€ daâ€˜wa . Finally, it argues that Muslim communities in colonial and post-colonial India shed light on these themes with particular clarity. Indian Muslims, this dissertation suggests, have made pioneering contributions to global daâ€˜wa , particularly with respect to their development of bottom-up styles of daâ€˜wa and what this dissertation calls â€œ daâ€˜wa modernities.â€ These arguments are developed in two parts. Part I provides an examination of daâ€˜wa in relation to other religions from the Qurâ€™an to the modern period. Since few studies have examined Islamic history through these lenses, this represents a major contribution in its own right. Building on Part I, Part II analyzes two prominent Sunni daâ€˜wa organizations to emerge from the Indian subcontinent in the past century: the TablÄ«ghÄ« JamÄâ€˜at (TJ) and the Islamic Research Foundation of Dr. Zakir Naik (IRF). By investigating and juxtaposing the lineages, formative histories and inter-religious discourses of these movements and their founders, Part II elucidates both the unique contributions Indian Muslims have made to modern daâ€˜wa , and the diversity of Indian daâ€˜wa. In response to the political, social and inter-religious challenges they have faced in modern India, and through their fresh engagement with Islamic scripture and tradition, these movements have developed related, though distinct, bottom-up styles of daâ€˜wa and daâ€˜wa modernities which have proven to be globally relevant. This dissertation thus makes a significant contribution to the study of daâ€˜wa in general and to the study of the TablÄ«ghÄ« JamÄâ€˜at. It also provides the first major scholarly study of Zakir Naik.",1872294456,,Dissertations & Theses," Kuiper, Matthew J.KuiperJ.MatthewKuiper, Matthew J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317317411 , 111224382 , 66569 , 9781369541441 , 10308159 , 10308159", Dissertation/Thesis,2016,9.78E+12, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872294456?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Religious history , Islamic Studies , South Asian Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Da'wa , Hadith , India , Islam , Naik, Zakir , Qur'an , Tablighi Jama'at",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indian+Muslims%2C+other+religions+and+the+modern+resurgence+of+Da%27wa%3A+The+Tabl%C4%ABgh%C4%AB+Jam%C4%81%27at+and+Zakir+Naik%27s+Islamic+Research+Foundation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kuiper%2C+Matthew+J.&amp;isbn=9781369541441&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.08877386,0.914711732,3024,Unknown,separatism," national identity movements. The three national identity movements examined in this dissertation are Chiapas (Mexico), East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia), and Quebec (Canada).",Constructing national identity: A qualitative analysis of separatism,"The study of public perceptions on nationalism continues to be problematic for sociology and the social sciences. For example, do the people of Catalan think of themselves first as being Catalonians, or are they Spanish or even European? Likewise, if the people have a hard time perceiving the true nature of their community identity, then external (i.e. international) public perceptions concerning the same agenda should be problematic as well. This dissertation limits its focus to external (international) media perceptions surrounding the social construction of national identity movements. The three national identity movements examined in this dissertation are Chiapas (Mexico), East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia), and Quebec (Canada). Theoretical basis for the study is drawn from Habermas' conceptualization of the public sphere (conflict theoretical approach), and is supported by the theoretical approaches of W. I. Thomas (definition of a situation), Berger and Luckmann's (social constructions of reality), and Foucault (post-modernist theory) to deconstruct international perceptions of the three social movements. A model is introduced to show the flow of social construction from competing factions within and outside a national identity movement to the outcomes that are produced and reported by international media sources covering aspects of social action. A sub-model is offered as a supplemental tool to the primary model, in order to organize (or deconstruct) the frame of major competing interests affecting social construction of the national identity movement cases. The study incorporated a qualitative methodology, which included assembling a data set consisting of 2,960 units (Chiapas N = 28; East Timor N = 1,030; and Quebec N = 1,902). Each data unit represented a separate international printed media source. Parameters for these data included a longitudinal range covering 1990â€“2000, and were coded into five major social institutional categories (political, economic, arts and entertainment, media and military). These categories were used to identify institutional shifts giving rise to the social construction of the three national identity movement cases during the given historical frame.

For if knowledge frameworks both shape the horizons of social intelli gi bil ity and chart t he realms of political possibility, then epistemological interventions constitute a crucial part of social change. Social movements play a key role in th is work by engaging in dissident knowledge practices that open up space for political transformation. But what are the processes and conditions through which social movements generate new ways of knowing?'What is politically at sta~e in the various knowledge strategies that activists use to generate social change? Despite a growing lite ratu re on the role of epistemological dimensions of protest, social movement studies tend to neglect specific questions of epistemological change. Often treating knowledge as a resource or object rather than a power relation and a socia l practice, social movement scholars tend to focus on content rather than production, frames rather than practices, taxonomies rather than processes. Missing is a more dynamic account of the conditions, means and power relations through which transformative knowledge practices come to be constituted and deployed. Seeking to better understand processes of epistemological transformation, this thesis explores the relationship between social movements, knowledge production and pol itical change. Starting from an assumption that knowledge not only represents the world, but also works to constitute it, th is thesis examines the role of social movement knowledge practices in shaping the conditions of political possi bility. Drawing from the context of grassroots queer, transgender and feminist organizing around issues of prisons and border controls in North America, the project explores how activists generate new forms of knowledge and forge new spaces of political possibility. Working through a series of concepts-transformation, resistance, exp_erience, co-optation, so lidarity and analogy-this thesis explores different ways of understanding processes of epistemological change with in social movement contexts. It considers processes that facil itate or enable epistemological change and those that lim it or prohibit such change. Bringing together a range of theoretical perspect ives, includ ing femin ist, queer, crit ica l race and post-structuralist analyses, and drawing on interviews with grassroots activists, the thesis explores what is politica lly at stake in the different ways we conceptua lise, imagine and engage in processes of epistemological change.",1775196995,,Dissertations & Theses," Lamble, Sarah R.LambleR.SarahLamble, Sarah R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3992906151 , 103111842 , 101309 , 10037216 , 10037216", Dissertation/Thesis,2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775196995?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10037216 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Epistemologies+of+possibility%3A+social+movements%2C+knowledge+production+and+political+transformation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lamble%2C+Sarah+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.861784622,0.899955744,2130,Left,state violence,restorative justice movemnets,Study on the factors of victims in prosecutorial discretion,"Translation from original language as provided by author The original purpose of studying on the factors of victims in prosecutorial discretion is mainly to seek the proposals for the balanced development among the relief to the offenced, improving the treatment to the accused and restoring social order by discussing the ways in which prosecutors must take the factors of victims into consideration in prosecutorial discretion and relatively the effects the factors of victims may have on prosecutorial discretion. Since the principles of pursuing crimes moves from private-oriented to public-oriented, the system of criminal justice has paid more attention to the protection of the suspect and the defendant and the criminal reform and education than that of victims, which turns victims gradually to be the means of controlling crimes and the rim of criminal policy concern and not until World War II has this trend reversed. With the rapid development of the movements aimed at rights for victims, the research of victimology and the strong initiation of restorative justice by the international society, the subject of the reform of criminal justice system in all countries has showed growingly a tendency to give victims more care, which provides an opportunity for us to choose this topic. In detail, what are the factors of victims in prosecutorial discretion? How to consider these factors during prosecutorial discretion? How about the history, the present situation and the trend of development of the related mechanisim in domestic and foreign judicial practices? These are what this article chiefly studies on. According to the above research frame, this thesis is consisted of three parts as follows: The first part provides a definition of the factors of victims in prosecutorial discretion, an overview of its historical evolution and a review of the system which limits the effects of the factors of victims in prosecutorial discretion under the traditional criminal proceeding structure. In the second part, a brief analysis is provided as to the influences of the factors of victims on prosecutorial discretion in different criminal justice systems, besides exploring the ways in which prosecutors must take the factors of victims into account in the course of their work in prosecutorial discretion.

The political, economic, and social structures and processes that emanate from ItaipÃºâ€”""hydroelectric statecraft""â€”have resulted in a ""hydrostate"" model similar to but with important distinctions from petrostate formations. Moreover, these findings have implications beyond the energy politics of South America but for the development of renewable energy resources worldwide and global water management. Leftist former Bishop Fernando Lugo toppled the six-decade ruling Colorado Party in Paraguay in April 2008, linking popular discontent to one issue: ItaipÃº, the world's largest dam. In 2008 it supplied 19 percent of Brazil's electricity and 95 percent of Paraguay's and Paraguay ""ceded"" the vast majority of its electricity to Brazil for 1/10 th to 1/40 th of the price of that energy on the Brazilian market. Lugo's government promised to renegotiate this inequity and use the wealth for ""social development"" under the rubric of ""sovereignty."" This historical ethnography is drawn from unparalleled access to leaders in the government as they negotiated with Brazil and administered the dam, social movements as they mobilized for ""hydroelectric sovereignty,"" and archival evidence within ItaipÃº and the Stroessner-era secret police Archives of Terror. Section I begins with the dam's founding as an expression of the Stroessner military dictatorship's dominance over nature and nation, local and international causes for construction of the dam and how ItaipÃº enabled the growth of the Paraguayan state apparatus, including the surveillance-torture regime. Section II turns to Lugo's dramatic rise to the presidency, new negotiations with Brazil, and promises to fight corruption by instituting ""transparency."" Section III offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the patronage, rent-seeking, and networks of obligation that surround the dam. Section IV explores how the political economy of energy in the Southern Cone is recrafted under ""energy integration"" as well as the debates within Paraguay about how ItaipÃº's millions should be invested socially.",935993724,,Dissertations & Theses," Folch, ChristineFolchChristineFolch, Christine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2616606481 , 68147352 , 66569 , 9781267235398 , 3499235 , 3499235", Dissertation/Thesis,2012,9.78E+12, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/935993724?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies , Energy"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Hydroelectric , Itaipu Dam , Paraguay , Sovereignty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+flows+of+sovereignty%3A+Itaip%C3%BA+hydroelectric+dam+and+the+ethnography+of+the+Paraguayan+nation-state&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Folch%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=9781267235398&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.286468982,0.973632531,2448,Right,state violence,police response to domestic violenc,Investigation of policing policy in relation to 'domestic violence' in London in the 1980s,"This thesis is an examination of the social construction of the social response to a social problem. The social problem is refered to as 'domestic violence' and the social response refers to the police response. The first chapter of the thesis constructs a theoretical approach grounded in the sociology of knowledge. Drawing on some of the classical sociological literature, the ideas of historians and philosophers of science, political philosophy and current social theory the concept of 'linguistic-authority-structure' is synthesized. Subsequent chapters apply the theoretical framework that this concept implies to illuminate the unfolding history of the issue of domestic violence. The versions of the social problem as they were articulated on different institutional sites (including the Women's Refuge Movement, social science, the law, the police and several others relevant) from the late-1960s to the mid-1980s are traced in the second third and forth chapters. The thesis documents the international trade in information about the issue. Of cenral importance is the importation of a deterrence paradigm emergent from an experimental project conducted by police researchers in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The importation of these ideas was partly instrumental in persuading police policy makers in Great Britain to announce policy changes regarding the policing of doemstic violence. This formation of a paradigmatic police response to domestic violence is located at a historically low ebb in the legitimacy of British Policing. The fifth chapter charts the history of post-war British Policing. Drawing on sociological accounts of operational policing, and the relevant criminological literature, this chapter illuminates the emergent political contestability of the police institution. The sixth chapter shows how, in this context, the policy regarding the policing of domestic violence was generated. Two chapters, seven and eight, are concerned with the actual police response to calls for service regarding interpersonal violence and in particular violence between cohabiting partners. These chapters make use of semi-structured interviews with police officers and an analysis of police paperwork procedures to illuminate police practices with regard to these calls for service. The two remaining chapters continue the historical analysis up to the end of the 1980s.",1625668907,,Dissertations & Theses," Sheptycki, JamesSheptyckiJamesSheptycki, James", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3499552921 , 91838402 , 189128 , 9781321353501 , U615767 , U615767", Dissertation/Thesis,1991,9.78E+12, English, English,,1991,PQDT - Global,1991,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1625668907?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0627 Criminology"," 0344 Social research , 0627 Criminology"," 0344 Social research , 0627 Criminology",," 0344 Social research , 0627 Criminology"," Social research , Criminology"," (UMI)AAIU615767 , Social sciences , Domestic violence , England , Police responses",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Investigation+of+policing+policy+in+relation+to+%27domestic+violence%27+in+London+in+the+1980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=1991-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sheptycki%2C+James&amp;isbn=9781321353501&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.690931271,0.970172425,3001,Right,state violence,Chile under Pinochet,"Beyond Pinochet: *Class, power and desire in Pinochet's Chile","This thesis deals with the process of deterritorialisation of Chile as a bio-political space initiated with military take over of 1973 and the integration of the country into the global system. It looks into the new networks of power created by the organic overlapping between State violence, media technologies and monetary flows as well as the new fabric for mass autonomies and resistances constituted throughout those networks themselves. By drawing on concepts of power, multitude, desire and class developed by autonomist Marxists such as Antonio Negri, Michael Hardt and Harry Cleaver and the â€œpost-structuralismâ€ of Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, I argue that the process of globalisation and neo-liberal restructuring occurring around the world over the last 25 years was strategic response by capital and the State to the social movements emerging in the late 60s. By looking at the case of Chile before and after the military coup, I suggest that State violence and neo-liberalism did not seek to destroy pre-existing mass resistances and autonomies, but to capture the collective creativity driving the struggle as an ontological foundation for the restructuration of capitalist accumulation itself. In this respect, class struggle is regarded methodologically as the main variable driving the modernisation of capitalism and marking the passage from a â€œdisciplinary societyâ€ to a â€œsociety of controlâ€ at global and national levels simultaneously. I seek to conclude that military dictatorship in Chile, far from being based in the power held by General Pinochet as head of State, was sustained through a new open ended web of global powers which were organised beyond the control of the Chilean nation state itself. This does not attempt to minimise the brutal role played by the military and Pinochet himself in repressing social movements, but to gain an understanding of the new complex economy of power within which torture, murder and exile took place and map the new possibilities for mass struggle it offered.",304739053,,Dissertations & Theses," Fiedler, Sergio PatricioFiedlerPatricioSergioFiedler, Sergio Patricio", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 726345471 , 27194261 , 66569 , 0803821 , 0803821", Dissertation/Thesis,2001,, English, English,,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2001,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304739053?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history",," 0700 Social structure , 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," Social structure , Political science , Latin American history"," Social sciences , Augusto Pinochet Ugarte , Chile , Class , Desire , Pinochet Ugarte, Augusto , Power",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+Pinochet%3A+++*Class%2C+power+and+desire+in+Pinochet%27s+Chile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2001-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fiedler%2C+Sergio+Patricio&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.979591665,0.967894248,3571,Right,state violence,state response to grassroots health development in Salvador,"Insurgent health, low-intensity medicine: Containing the threat of grassroots development in El Salvador","This is a study of the role that grassroots health development work played in shaping and signifying power relations between a militaristic state and a dissident peasant population during and in the aftermath of civil war. My thesis is that grassroots development work in this rural province was viewed as a threat in its own right by Salvadoran authorities, and that the U.S. government assisted with tactics used to undermine this work. In Part One I use the existential dialectic of ""Healing and Terror"" to (1) look at the role of state coercion in marginalizing the Chalateco peasantry; and I examine the cultural and political polarization that this ""systemic violence"" has created. (2) I then use an anthropology of the body to explore the impact of living in a culture of terror on peasant consciousness, arguing that an analysis of tacit social practices and discourses of the peasantry shows that coercion plays an important role in the cultural hegemony of a militarized state. (3) I then reconstruct the history of state repression against Chalatenango's dissident peasant movement during the late 1970s, and the role of this repression in spurring the peasant rebellion. (4) I then examine the central role played by health workers in community-building survival practices adopted by Chalateco peasants during the many years they spent cut off from the rest of the country, in a war zone, in exile, and in a mass repopulation of villages located in rebel-controlled territory. In Part Two I examine the state's efforts to manipulate symbolism of health and medicine to shore up the nationalist project. I present a body of evidence showing that rural health work was regarded by the government as a target in low-intensity conflict, and I examine the government's use of medical symbolism ""psychological warfare."" In Part Three I examine the role of ""popular"" health development in the repopulated Chalatenango communities as a form of social healing, arguing that this community-based approach to health, based on local lay providers, was a powerful critique of state rural health programs, which was accomplishing many goals of ""community participation,"" a component of international health development programs that has proven elusive in many settings. In Part Four I look at the (partically successful) efforts of the government to coopt the popular health system during the first four years of the peace process (1992-95), and I show that there was clear political motivation from high levels of the Ministry of Health to undermine community health approaches, both in this ex-war zone, and in other areas of the country where health work involved organizing community support.",304440873,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith-Nonini, Sandra CarolSmith-NoniniCarolSandraSmith-Nonini, Sandra Carol", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 732886021 , 28585171 , 66569 , 9780591949353 , 0591949350 , 9840994 , 9840994", Dissertation/Thesis,1998," 9780591949353 , 0591949350", English, English,,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1998,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304440873?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0573 Public health"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Public health"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , El Salvador , Grassroots , Health development , Insurgent , Medicine , Peasantry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Insurgent+health%2C+low-intensity+medicine%3A+Containing+the+threat+of+grassroots+development+in+El+Salvador&amp;issn=&amp;date=1998-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith-Nonini%2C+Sandra+Carol&amp;isbn=9780591949353&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.058537548,0.916834066,787,Right,state violence,"the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador",Policing the Wretched: Transnational Apparatuses of Social Control in the Early 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called â€œwar on drugsâ€ in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call â€œtransnational apparatuses of social controlâ€. It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed â€œwarsâ€ on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance. The three different sites (Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador) exemplify the linkages of transnational methods of social control and opposition during the epoch of global capitalism.",1731126945,,Dissertations & Theses," Osuna, StevenOsunaStevenOsuna, Steven", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858701221 , 99808362 , 66569 , 9781339218205 , 3733525 , 3733525", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731126945?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Sociology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Global capitalism , Hip hop , Moral panic , Racism , Social control , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Policing+the+Wretched%3A+Transnational+Apparatuses+of+Social%0AControl+in+the+Early+21st+Century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Osuna%2C+Steven&amp;isbn=9781339218205&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.34402431,0.899653667,3516,Right,state violence,political violence in Peru during the 1980s,"Violent democratization and the feeble state: Political violence, breakdown and recomposition in Peru, 1980-1995","This is a study of the expansion of political violence in Peru during the 1980s and early 1990s, after Peru made a successful transition from military to civilian, constitutional rule in 1980. This dissertation attempts to explain how a broad, inclusive party system which included a strong partisan left could coexist with a powerful and pervasive violent left, led by Sendero Luminoso ('Shining Path'). It also explains why Peru experienced a rupture in democratic rule on April 5, 1992, the so-called autogolpe (or 'self-coup') instigated by President Alberto Fujimori. It also seeks to understand the factors which enabled the post-coup civil-military regime to consolidate its power. The theoretical framework presented is a state-oriented framework, which examines the interaction of economic, political, social and international factors with state capacity along four dimensions. The argument is that both the 'violent democratization' and autogolpe phenomena can be explained in terms of factors relating to the incapacity of the Peruvian state during the 1980s. State weakness, I argue, contributed to a political and economic opportunity structure (PEOS) which was favorable to the expansion of political violence at precisely the moment at which Peru was moving toward a more inclusive, participatory regime. State weaknesses also generated a political crisis which led to a backlash against traditional parties, and this antiparty backlash in turn paved the way for political independents, notably Alberto Fujimori, to rise to power and subsequently to disband the constitutional regime inaugurated in 1980 in favor of a highly centralized civilian regime with broadly expanded presidential powers and strong military backing, a regime which challenges conventional notions of democracy and authoritarianism and contains elements of both. Utilizing various methods, primarily interviewing, statistical analysis presented in cartographic (map) form, archival research and secondary source research, the analysis reveals political and economic transformations at both the national and regional (departmental) levels of analysis which led to the expansion of violence in conjunction with the expansion of democratic participation, the breakdown of a democratic regime, and the consolidation of the new civil-military regime in the context of a radically restructured state along neoliberal lines. Economic variables are by themselves found to be inaccurate predictors of levels of violence across regions of a society. Meanwhile, the relative presence or absence of political authority, whether state authority or private authority is found to be a major determinant of levels of conflict across regions of a democratizing country. Structures of authority thwart the expansion of political violence, while the relative absence of those structures of authority can encourage the expansion of violence, especially in relatively affluent regions. The analysis also reveals that civil society can also be a major, albeit unwitting contributor to political violence in that sectors of society can be exploited by a guerrilla movement in pursuit of power, contributing to higher levels of violence. Finally, this dissertation demonstrates how the restructuring of the state can contribute to both a decline in violent conflict and the stability of an elected, civilian regime which is widely supported but not 'democratic' in the conventional sense.",304263109,,Dissertations & Theses," Kay, Bruce HowardKayHowardBruceKay, Bruce Howard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 739591891 , 31582641 , 66569 , 0591235765 , 9780591235760 , 9715723 , 9715723", Dissertation/Thesis,1996," 0591235765 , 9780591235760", English, English,,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1996,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304263109?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history",," 0615 Political science , 0336 Latin American history"," Political science , Latin American history", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Violent+democratization+and+the+feeble+state%3A+Political+violence%2C+breakdown+and+recomposition+in+Peru%2C+1980-1995&amp;issn=&amp;date=1996-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kay%2C+Bruce+Howard&amp;isbn=0591235765&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.588056464,0.942410417,3400,Right,technology, government and the business) perspectives on IT and 'IS',"Imagining the ""information society"": The case of Taiwan","Centring on information technology (IT), this thesis examines two broad but related areas of interests: ideological formations and material movements. Starting from a historical survey it contrasts two visions of 'information society' (IS), and then goes on to depict the social background from which these visions arise. It is found that since the 1960s the capitalist world system has been undergoing crisis, and it becomes especially obvious in the 1980s that IT has been playing a crucial role in restructuring capitalism. As such, the concept of IS and practical functions subsumed by IT have important implications for (semi-)peripheral countries . As one of the widely claimed economic 'miracles' Taiwan's recent developmental trajectory is particularly useful for realising how IT functions and how dominant ideas about 'IS' disseminate. Benefiting from selling IT, Taiwan's experience cannot be said to have constituted a successful story supporting the modernisation theory. Rather, the developmental process she has so far gone through fits the arguments of the world-system approach. Taiwan's quick rise to seize IT for expanding her economic base tells a very good example as how the international capital, the state, and the national capital cooperate and clash. In contrast, Taiwan's records of using IT for production, transmission or consumption are rather poor. This reflects her position in the world system in general, however, it is a necessary result considering that her economic structure is based on small business. On the side of ideological representations, this study confirms the dominant pattern of IT coverage in the popular media (newspapers). Though the newspapers have not yet produced a coherent articulation of different elements of the idea of 'IS', it relays uncritically the established (the government and the business) perspectives on IT and 'IS'. The protesting or suspicious opinions about them are therefore contained in marginal places like the environmental movements or expressed in science fictions.",301556956,,Dissertations & Theses," Fang, Chien-sanFangChien-sanFang, Chien-san", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1756341381 , 44380541 , 101309 , U036946 , U036946", Dissertation/Thesis,1990,, English, English,,1990,PQDT - UK & Ireland,1990,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301556956?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIU036946 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+the+%22information+society%22%3A+The+case+of+Taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=1990-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fang%2C+Chien-san&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.90844545,0.993664939,1239,Unknown,technology,open-source software movement,The production of free software: an ethnographic enquiry into a new social practise,"This thesis traces and analyses the process of producing free software as social practice. The term free software is used for computer programs that can be employed, examined, distributed and modified without restriction.Â  What started with a small group of software developers in the 1980s has grown into a full-blown techno-political movement that has changed the way software is produced.Â  In the last ten years or so, free software has come to the attention of a global public because it so successfully provides access to resources that the conventional software industry has failed to deliver. It is often reasoned that this is due to its technical superiority.Â  My data suggests, however, that technical capacity is achieved through a social practice that is based upon collaboration.Â  Indeed collaboration constitutes a new form of material production that aims to make intangible resources (i.e. software) available to a large number of people worldwide.Â  In this dissertation I argue that the way in which contributors to free software collaborate and provide material objects differs from what we know of the conventional production of techno-scientific artefacts.Â  The innovative method of producing free software relies philosophically upon quite conventional political ideology which can best be described as liberal individualism.Â  This ideology informs participantsâ€™ discourse and practice as well as helps to integrate and stabilise the community. My ethnographic data shows that despite the worldwide distribution of the movementâ€™s members, the majority of them originate from the well-educated middle class, an elite that strongly relies on these philosophical values. To defend their collaborative methods of production, free software participants engage in political action against certain forms of neo-liberal legislation concerning â€˜intellectual propertyâ€™.Â  Their productive practices are based upon an alternative model of ownership of intangible goods which constitutes both a liberal critique of and an alternative to the concept of â€˜intellectual propertyâ€™.",1779949545,,Dissertations & Theses," Krieger, Bernhard LudwigKriegerLudwigBernhardKrieger, Bernhard Ludwig", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017505331 , 64941291 , 101309 , U566873 , U566873", Dissertation/Thesis,2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779949545?accountid=14496, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0624 Occupational psychology, Occupational psychology," (UMI)AAIU566873 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+production+of+free+software%3A+an+ethnographic+enquiry+into+a+new+social+practise&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Krieger%2C+Bernhard+Ludwig&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.631819962,0.981735577,2172,Right,traditional values,homeschooling movement in the US,The experiences of homeschool mothers,"The homeschooling movement is an alternative education choice that continues to grow in the United States. Research is available on how well homeschooled students do academically and even socially, yet little research has been done on their primary teachers, usually the mother. The studies that have included information on the mothers often focus on Christian homeschool families. This study looked at six homeschooling mothers and asked, ""What is the nature of homeschool mothers' experiences, specifically for those homeschooling mothers who indicate their primary reason for homeschooling is not based on their religious beliefs?"" An examination of this question provided insight into the joys and challenges that homeschool mothers face during their journey. Topic areas of interest included how homeschool mothers make the decision to homeschool, the style of homeschooling they use, how they cope with the day-to-day teaching of their children, whether or not they experience isolation, and the use of networks to support and sustain them as individuals, teachers, and mothers. An exploratory qualitative research design was used for this study. This design utilized case study method to frame the research study while incorporating aspects of ethnography and autoethnography to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of homeschool mothers. Data was collected from each participant in the form of three interviews, one focus group meeting, one informal observation (mothers-night-out) of the focus group, and visual images in the form of drawings. Informal observations were conducted during each interview and recorded as field notes. Elements of autoethnography via a memory log and memos reflecting my own experience of homeschooling four children for over 20 years were incorporated into the study. Management of the data took place in QSR International's NVivo 9 software (NVivo) which provided tools to aid in organization and continual analysis of data. The use of NVivo allowed the data to be categorized in a manner that assisted in the recognition of trends and themes within the data. NVivo did not do the analysis, but allowed me to organize the data to provide access to information that have relationships to each other. Subjectivity was addressed by recognizing my own bias towards homeschooling through reflexive memos and through feedback from my committee members and fellow doctoral students in my dissertation seminar. There were several key findings from this study. The reasons to homeschool were varied and included a desire for more time together as a family, public and private schools not meeting the educational and/or social needs of the children, and children requesting to be homeschooled. The literature available does not address homeschooling from the perspective of being sought by the child. The style of homeschooling utilized by the participants was primarily unschooling; the findings indicated that how they defined unschooling varied considerably. Participants were wary of being characterized as radical unschoolers and expressed concern over indicating to others that they unschooled, so as not to be confused with radical unschoolers. Half of the participants experienced community isolation and this study considered methods to reduce isolation in the future. Findings in the area of support networks revealed that a lack of family support negatively impacted the homeschool mothers' experience and was the support most desired by the participants. Major sources of support came from spouses and other homeschool mothers. The findings from this study explored how homeschool mothers sustained themselves and indicated that personal satisfaction derived from teaching their children was the primary source of their satisfaction and self-efficacy. The participants also used a variety of hobbies to sustain them as individuals that included volunteering, reading, gardening, and cooking. Homeschooling continues to be a growing movement in the area of alternative education choices. The number of families who are choosing to homeschool their children has increased substantially in the last ten years. In 2007, a report by the National Center for Education Statistics indicated 1.5 million students were homeschooled (Bielek, 2008). A study by Ray (2011) found 2.04 million students being homeschooled in the United States and that the rate of growth in homeschooling is higher than the growth rate of students entering schools. The growth in homeschooling calls for further research on why more parents are choosing to homeschool and what are their experiences while homeschooling their children. As more parents make the decision to homeschool, further insight into the topic of homeschooling mothers may be of interest to educators to further their understanding of the homeschool movement.",1176491871,,Dissertations & Theses," Finch, Deborah D.FinchD.DeborahFinch, Deborah D.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying

Western Middle Class and Social Stability,"In recent years the research of middle class have become domestic and international sphere of learning with the problem that highly paid attention to, and arouse the universal solicitude of the scholars such as politics, sociology as well as economics- Paper researching the major problem that will be discussed is the relationship between western middle class and social order in the modern course of social political, economic and ideological cultural changes- Paper research has adopted the theory of modernization in political sociology for background, and social stratified theory for analysis frame- It is in historical materialism and dialectics materialism as the foundation to study, and specific research technique are method of comparison, class analysis method, system method as well as the case method- Theory of the western research of middle class set up in advance is: Middle class experienced from industrial and commercial development and civil society is the social stratum and group with similar to self appraises, worth orientation, way of life and psychological feature as wellï¼Œ therefore, takes important affection in market orientation, stability and development of society- Paper major theoretical orientation is different from theoretical viewpoint of the ""stabilizer""ï¼Œ "" balanced ship "" , and "" buffer "" the etc- in western theoretical research of middle class- Paper theoretical starting point and the basic assumption that sustains are: Since modern social transition middle class has broken up, made up and developed that makes itself filling with contradictoriness, different quality and complexity, it is not one for class- From the visual angle of social systematic variable to analyze dialectically, in the diversity of market economy of the course of the modern development, promoting the diversity of benefit subject and diversity of value orientation, middle class not only behavior orientation and the group consciousness in realistic society is a complex variable, and is also an important variable in the relation of development and stability of society- In the countries of different political and cultural background, each still has different intension and feature- Therefore relation between middle class and stability of social order not only lies in middle classâ€™ market ability, still depend on them whether have to win extensive cooperation and support of other social strata, mutually depend on it whether has the ability of participating in and promoting political democracy with the system background of country and society- This paper contains six chapters, which are outlined as follows: Introduction focuses on the reason and significance of the research, and summarizes the documents related to western middle class- At the same time, introduces the configuration of theory, basic concepts, research technique and major innovation- The first chapter discusses the theories of social stability and structural feature- This paper from the field of political sociology, thinks society stability be a complex systematic project of multidimensional degrees, its subsystems are depended on, interacted, restricted and affected mutually with dialectically unified relation- It is the comprehensive results of each subsystem developing to the stability of society- And middle class is variable and an essential factor in this systematic project only- Society stabilizes and develops should be the results of expressing benefits from each class and stratum of society in mutual competition, cooperation, compromise and balance, middle class can only is one of common winner in this kind of game- So the theoretical stabilizer that sets up in advance is not enough, merely a kind of static theoretical idea and unidirectional thought relatively- The second chapter is about the relation of western middle class and social changes from historical investigation- The paper relies on classical theory of Marxism as ideological guidance, does not think stability be the inherent feature or inevitable property of middle class, ""balanced ship"" and ""safe valve"" also do not be its congenital social function, commonplace, mild and conservative more do not be the social nature, and middle class has no fixed pattern in the course of social development- On the one hand, in the various stratum strengthens to pressure for political order, the middle class with benefit diversity and diversity of value orientation is often a kind of instability factor probably, on the other hand, each class in a society (include middle class) if can not get deserved social resource and system arrangement, it is the reason that it may form social order and normal to lose- Therefore how to guide, hold and develop the social function of middle class are still the important social program to the capitalist countries with different developing route- The third chapter focuses on the western middle class in class theory, it is the main part of this essay- This paper thinks the middle class with developing and changing, and then analyses from social systematic variance, though middle class in games of society with contradictory nature, it is a development variance of social development all along- Middle class regardless of opts what kind of role appeared in social political stage on, is compared by stratum strength and the expectation tension, as well as is political, economic, cultural background decided- They oppose and compromise, struggle and cooperation with each stratum, and insist to be subject of utility and interests in the choice of society politics, adjust goal with utility and interests to "" reasonably "" opt friend or competitor, middle class is hard to become leading class- Regardless of Theory of ""management revolution"" or Theory of ""revolution of science and technology"", the meaning is a kind of regulation in the field of private ownership only- Its limit is not destructive to bourgeois with controlling for enterprise efficiently as the watershed, it cannot be exceeded power boundary between the middle class and the class of upper levels- The fourth chapter thinks deeply from present situation about the relation of middle class and social order with the principle of Integration of theory with practice- This paper investigates the economic positionã€cultural life and social political attitude of middle class in the present western societyï¼Œand thinks it has filled with multiplicity, contradictoriness and complexity- At the same time explains the pattern of middle class in language environment of western culture cannot beâ€œcloneâ€ï¼ˆonly refer toï¼Œnot copy to apply mechanicallyï¼‰with comparison, because economic and political positions of middle class are not firm, it is in course of breaking up and constructing continuously- So its intension that not only has difference in different ideology and the cultural background, also has different social attitude under different social stage and situation- Middle class should be the correspondingly developed concept in social historical development, is a concept of cultural and social space-time with discrepancy- Therefore the research for middle class cannot be static, especially for the country of ""post-development form"" can not ""consume theoretically"", otherwise will be impossible to understand the developing feature of society really- The fifth chapter is from the viewpoint of analysis of system to discuss the system, organization and mechanism for stability of social politics in western developed countries- It emphasizes mutually positive exchange between country and society, and to promote and regulate and maintenance the relation between country and society with mutually positive exchange should be political system, arrangement of system as well as orientation- At the same time, this paper tries to combine the tendency of diversity in present western society, to discuss political running form of present western society, it is not the pattern of class or stratum, and appears mainly with the forms of benefit group and social organization- Because of class, the ability of engagement in political action has been weakened by social diversity, the built-in benefit of class is nearly impossible, and the development of related the profession, occupation with more close benefit has replaced the organization role of class gradually- Different groups of middle class are playing their social political roles in the benefit groups with background of profession and occupation- Under the restraint of social order and system, benefit group or social organization as the political participator become the effective mechanism of benefit expression and balance, makes social tension keeping in controlled and helpful for society to stabilize- Finally, though political systems in western developed countries have drawback and are faced with problem and challenge, the essay considers that developed countries do not go through coup and the revolution from long-term, the public holds certain political identification for system, institution and policy, and has reflected the legality of regime and authoritativeness of government- On the other hand, capitalist to be not enclosed, rigid system, it is a kind of civilization impacted, adjusted, transformed and developed continuously by socialist criticism and lash- Presently capitalism is still developing continuously, it is explained that the system and institution arrangement have certain reasonability and meet foundation and development of social politics, economy and culture- Though western society movements to ebb and flow, can be controlled with various means in the scope that public order allows in, and various incidents can be also dissolved in the scope of system configuration and legal system- The channel of public leading off, benefit expression and politics participation is unblocked, it makes one-side social problem do not be gather and become comprehensive social problemï¼Œand local social conflict or upheavalã€riot will not be brew and develop to social crisis with overall situation- Consequently, from the viewpoint of political sociology, stability of social politics in western developed countries relies on function of stability that political system and institutions have withï¼Œand can not be divided with the function of the political structure and system that maintain the balance and stability of various power relations, and this is not only relying on middle class or market power-",1024943127,

of collectivism,"This study is an investigation of the perceptible variations of individualism and collectivism as manifested in the context of Chinese sport, especially the â€œsport for allâ€ movement, through a survey conducted in Kunming, China. In China, though the dominant collective values are still influencing the development of sport, there is an apparent pursuit of individual interests in sport concurrent with the global upsurge of the â€œsport for allâ€ movement. Furthermore, the stress placed by the authorities in China on collective interests in sport has been diminishing. These conditions, coupled with the shift toward individualism brought about by modernization (Triandis et al, 1994), have made it likely that the prevalence of individualism in Chinese sport will increase. The overall argument of this study is that individualism holds a significant place in â€œsport for allâ€ in China, a society which is usually viewed as having a collectivist orientation. A survey instrument was designed to tap the variations in individualist and collectivist beliefs, values, and appeals. Also, differences among target groups such as age groups and modern or traditional sport participants were investigated. The sample was composed of 954 people aged 18 years or older with diverse social and economic backgrounds. The findings of this study revealed that the respondents significantly favored collectivist beliefs regarding the functions of â€œsport for allâ€, whereas they were motivated to take part in sport more for individualist reasons. Also, they endorsed collectivist values of sport and appeals of group sport participation more strongly than the individualist ones. Moreover, this study also found certain variations in individualist/collectivist orientation along fines of age, gender, education, and income. Finally, the relationship between individualism and sport in China is discussed and implications for theory and practice as well as for future study are indicated.",304507189,,Dissertations & Theses," Jiang, WenJiangWenJiang, Wen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 730230621 , 30389671 , 66569 , 9780599561243 , 0599561246 , 9953054 , 9953054", Dissertation/Thesis,1999," 9780599561243 , 0599561246", English, English,,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,1999,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304507189?accountid=14496, 0814 Recreation, 0814 Recreation, 0814 Recreation,, 0814 Recreation, Recreation," Social sciences , China , Collectivism , Individualism , Sport",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Individualism+and+sport+in+modern+China+beyond+the+myth+of+collectivism&amp;issn=&amp;date=1999-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jiang%2C+Wen&amp;isbn=9780599561243&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.109527762,0.954335558,2349,Unknown,militias,militant groups in the Niger Delta,Oil governance in the niger delta: exploring the role of the militias,"This thesis explores the complex voices of militants, associated with the capture of oil resources in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The persistent violent conflict involving militant groups in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a major concern for many within the country and the international community. Understanding the conflict in the Niger Delta has triggered a wide range of discussions and debates among researchers, politicians and policy makers. However, these debates have overlooked the views of the militants, who are actively engaged in the conflict over resource governance in the region. Moreover the ideology of self-determination and resource control, which these militants use to legitimise their actions, seem to generate different meanings and labelling that tend to cloud an understandings of the conflict in the region. In this thesis, I adopt the theoretical assumptions of the New Social Movement literature and the epistemological views of the Interpretivist Social Constructionist approach to explore (a) what features shaped the emergence of militancy and its diverse forms (b) how do militias make sense of their role as militants? (c) how does the role of militias impact on the politics of oil governance in the Niger Delta? I argue that militia actions that appear to challenge the legitimacy and authority of the Nigerian state to control oil resources, are embedded in complex webs involving formal and informal interactions of political elites and militia leaders. From analysis of this research, key dominant concepts such as Identity, opportunism and competition, emerged to give insight as to why and how militancy has become significant in the region.",1792787824,,Dissertations & Theses," Tantua, BenTantuaBenTantua, Ben", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4073826521 , 103733102 , 101309 , 10115429 , 10115429 , http://opus.bath.ac.uk/49310/", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1792787824?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://opus.bath.ac.uk/49310/ , (UMI)AAI10115429 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Oil+governance+in+the+niger+delta%3A+exploring+the+role+of+the+militias&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tantua%2C+Ben&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.108669089,0.973993543,3078,Left,urban/rural questions,homelessness,Globalization at home: Economics and homelessness in Marin County,"The lens of economic globalization and global capitalism was used to explore economic disparities and homelessness in Marin County, California, one of the wealthiest counties in the United States.

Since this transition, South Africa has legislated the collapse of apartheid and the attendant reorganization of movements of people through urban landscapes while simultaneously negotiating its re-entry into international networks of commerce and cultural exchange. There are, however, numerous ways in which literary works have challenged the narrative of the â€œrainbow nationâ€ by pointing to how South African urbanscapes physically manifest various anxieties of post-apartheid subjectivity. To illuminate this interaction, this thesis explores the interrelationship between formations of national identity and fictionalized representations of urban space in the works of Ivan VladislaviÄ‡. VladislaviÄ‡ is an acclaimed yet surprisingly under theorized South African author whose work gestures to the conceptual challenge of rethinking the relationship between subjectivity and social space. VladislaviÄ‡'s characters are frequently architects or city planners; his narratives focus on the symbology of the contemporary cityscape, enabling him to illustrate how, in the specific context of Johannesburg (the setting for each of his major works), imagining and representing space is foundational to understanding and influencing the material reality responsible for controlling human movement. The central contention of this thesis is that VladislaviÄ‡â€™s novels The Restless Supermarket , The Folly , and The Exploded View , provide a critique of urban development discourse by deconstructing discursive systems that produce static, closed, and diagrammatic spatial representations and in doing so reveal key ideological foundations of apartheid that both pre-existed and currently survive its formal regime. Additionally, his novels Double Negative and Portrait with Keys provide examples of alternative subjectivities whose spatial imaginations offer different vantage points for mapping the built environment that remain changeable and open to alterity and that therefore suggest a potential ethical response to existing inside/outside social demarcations that are currently spatially realized in South Africa.",1819570324,,Dissertations & Theses," Hawkins, FraserHawkinsFraserHawkins, Fraser", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4182904631 , 107795162 , 66569 , 9781369102031 , 10155118 , 10155118", Dissertation/Thesis,2015,9.78E+12, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819570324?accountid=14496," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies"," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies"," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies",," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies"," African literature , South African Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Apartheid , Ivan VladislaviÄ‡ , National identity , Rainbow nation , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reading+the+golden+city%3A+Spatial+representation+and+urban+semiotics+in+the+work+of+Ivan+Vladislavi%C4%87&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hawkins%2C+Fraser&amp;isbn=9781369102031&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.872925935,0.985240694,1146,Left,urban/rural questions,rural China,On the study of the reform of residence registration system under the background of the balance urban and rural development,"Translation from original language as provided by author Over the years, the dual urban-rural economic structure formed during the planned economy era has not been reformed which led to economic and social development between urban and rural of China have been separated, the discrimination between urban and rural continue to be expanded and rural development is far behind the city, lead to ""Three Rural Issues"" have become increasingly prominent and become one of the key factors causing the disharmony of our society in China. We must balance urban and rural economic and social development to solve the ""three rural issue"", to achieve a harmonious socialist society and to achieve overall well-off. It's stated in the 17th Party Congress that ""balance urban and rural development and build a new socialist countryside."" Balance urban and rural development, it is necessary to break the urban-rural dual economic structure to achieve economic and social integration of urban and rural development, and give full play to the role of cities in rural areas and rural driving role in promoting the city in order to promote agriculture through industry to the city with a township form urban and rural development pattern of interaction and promote the coordinated development of urban and rural areas. It's a key element of carrying out and implementing the scientific concept of development, a essential way to speeding up agricultural and rural economic and social development, increasing peasant incomes, and a necessary requirements to building a moderately prosperous society and to promote sound and fast economic development, and it's pointed out the direction to solve ""the three rural"" issue of the new era in the new situation. However, China's current household registration management system is succeeded from the old ones which formed during the planned economy era for detention population movements based on ""pro-urban"" concept as a guide, it serves the traditional structure of the rigid planned economic system, will our citizens artificially divided into two categories of urban residents and rural residents, and these two categories of person who has a different distribution system and benefits, forming an insurmountable gap between urban and rural areas, so that the free movement of labor is impossible, resulting in lagging rural economy , development is far behind the city, fundamentally hampered China's economic and social development, and hindered the process of urbanization, and become a major obstacle of the overall strategy for balance urban and rural development in China. Therefore, Balance urban and rural development, we must reform the existing household registration management system, breaking the durance to freedom of movement and freedom to settle, setting the integration of a unified urban and rural household registration management system, eliminating the division of agricultural population and non-agricultural population, giving the same rights as urban and rural residents, while also abolish the residence attached to the different interests on the distribution system, giving equal rights to each citizen in education, social security, employment, eliminating the administrative barriers of rural-urban transfer. Only in this way, we can greatly improve the level of urbanization, develop the modern agriculture, solve the ""three rural"" issue, promote the rural surplus labor force and increase the income of the farmers, improve the rural-urban transfer promote urban and rural co-coordinated development. In this paper, the conceptions of balance urban and rural development, the household registration and household registration management system are defined first, then the household registration management system during feudal period, modern times, and after the founding of New China are discussed, the foreign household registration management system are outlined, the differences between domestic and international household registration management system is compared in detail, the shortcomings and origins of the existing household registration management system are analysised, finally from the view of balance urban and rural development, the new requires are analysised from three points ""equal rights given to urban and rural populations ; abolition of migration of imprisonment, accelerate the pace of urbanization; establishment of a scientific population management system, and urban and rural construction planning"", and made goals of the reform of the household registration and proposals of reforms based on this",1873840940,,Dissertations & Theses," Gong, GuanGongGuanGong, Guan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318155921 , 111078792 , 189128 , 10469352 , 10469352", Dissertation/Thesis,2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873840940?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAI10469352 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+study+of+the+reform+of+residence+registration+system+under+the+background+of+the+balance+urban+and+rural+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gong%2C+Guan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.55743138,0.983826135,2309,Left,urban/rural questions,cooperatives in India,"The co-operative model town society: history, planning, architecture and social character of an indigenous garden suburb in colonial lahore","This thesis investigates the Co-operative Model Town Society Lahore; a town covering an area of around 2000 acres developed in the 1920â€™s in the (then) suburbs of Lahore, capital of Punjab province in British India. The Town is a remarkable interpretation of Ebenezer Howardâ€™s Garden City ideals and the co-operative principles. However, the real significance of the town is it being a unique example of a co-operative garden town built by the local Indian bourgeois, majority of whom were forced to migrate due to the disturbances that followed after the declaration of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947. Despite the admiration and significance of the Town in the realm of pre and post-Independence Lahore, very little has been documented about it. Its formal documented history is non-existent while its original built environment, an excellent example to illustrate late-colonial architecture in the region, is diminishing rapidly due to negligence and reconstructions. The aim of this research is the documentation of history, urban form, social character and architecture of the pre-independence Model Town. Consequently, through an analysis of its built environment this study intends to develop an insight into the colonizer-colonized cultural transfers, in particular, to the transformation of British town planning ideas in the colonies due to their interpretation by the local Indians under the influence of prevalent religious, cultural and social practices. The research was conducted by the process of historical construction, whereby evidences from the documents and the built environment have been used collectively to develop the historiography of the town. The selection of primary material has been based on its availability as the documentary evidences are scattered across Pakistan, India and the UK. The built environment has been documented using the official drawings as well as onsite surveys and measurements where the original drawings are unavailable. The Town has been analysed in a comparative setting with respect to contemporary urban, architectural and social trends and practices prevalent locally ( both by the colonial rulers and the colonized natives) as well as global movements, especially Western ideologies and perspectives and their retrospect local adaptations. The documentation and analysis were used as a ground for four interpretative conclusions. The first conclusion elaborates on the need of urban historiography in Pakistan. The second conclusion interprets the Model Town in the realm of twentieth century urban planning in the region. The third conclusion elaborates on the colonial architectural styles. The fourth conclusion gives an insight into the Model Town with reference to western styled â€˜Indianâ€™ nationalism.",1827600204,,Dissertations & Theses," Anbrine, ShamaAnbrineShamaAnbrine, Shama", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209784381 , 102698782 , 101309 , 10177202 , 10177202 , http://repository.liv.ac.uk/2010879/", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827600204?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://repository.liv.ac.uk/2010879/ , (UMI)AAI10177202 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+co-operative+model+town+society%3A+history%2C+planning%2C+architecture+and+social+character+of+an+indigenous+garden+suburb+in+colonial+lahore&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anbrine%2C+Shama&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.53294164,0.957515082,888,Left,urban/rural questions,gezi protests in Turkey,Film festivals and social movements intertwined: the spatial activism of the istanbul film festival audience during the gezi protests,"This thesis focuses on the relationship between film festivals and political activism by taking the International Istanbul Film Festival (IIFF) audience as a case study during the Gezi uprising. It is a study of a communityâ€™s political action hand in hand with their cosmopolitan imagination and nostalgic feelings in their engagement with the IIFF, when Turkey increasingly lurched towards authoritarianism in the 2010s. Through the increasing number of festival films and events that went against the dominant ideology in Turkey, this audience community embraced an activist cosmopolitanism which set the ground for political action. It scrutinises their formation of nostalgic feelings for the historical spaces in BeyoÄŸlu, developed jointly by their anti-neoliberal discourses while also displaying their political action against the top-down urban regeneration programmes. In order to account for their political activism, revolving initially around festival spaces and then occupied parks, I conducted an ethnographic research at the festival and the Gezi uprising from 2013 to 2014. Employing participant observation, life histories and in-depth interviews, this research examines the intricacies of human relations with spaces, social movements and cultural events at an increasingly authoritarian regime. The rise of authoritarianism also implied a transformation in my methodology. This thesis offers a timely contribution to the relationship between neoliberalism and Islamic fundamentalism while pointing to peopleâ€™s political use of cultural spaces. It also offers new insights on the phenomenon of film festivals by relating them to urban cultures and social movements in their hosting cities. It expands our knowledge on non-Western audiencesâ€™ engagement with a film festival, whilst providing an interpretation of social movement development attached to cultural spaces such as film festivals. More broadly, it gives new insights on the film and protest culture of a secular group within a predominantly Muslim culture in showing the ways in which they oppose Islamic fundamentalism and neoliberalism. It situates the Emek movement and the Gezi uprising, not only in their close affinity with Istanbulâ€™s cityscape and Turkeyâ€™s political situation but also in their organic relationship with global social movements particularly the Occupy movements and the Arab Spring.

While the bulk of classic twentieth-century architectural history addresses Art Nouveau as an elite, sinuous art form, this paper highlights, by contrast, its profound social consciousness. Holistic design, structural rationalism, and functionality characterized the restrained, consciously modern aesthetic. Art nouveau and art social , used interchangeably, signified the goals of reform, education, and equality, in theoretical opposition to ""art for art's sake."" Because the architectural center suffered the hygienic and housing crisis acutely, Paris was the nexus of debate and experiment surrounding the moral implications and definition of the new typology. Through organizations such as the International Society for Popular Art and Hygiene and the leadership of theorists Roger Marx, Henri Cazalis, and Frantz Jourdain, architects embraced worker housing as one means of fostering ""art in everything, everywhere, and for everyone."" The domestic environment became the symbol of rational identity and an index of well-being, denoting in turn French insecurity in a competitive European marketplace; the struggle to redefine values and strengths in the face of modernity; and the desire to reassert Paris as the international arbiter of the avant-garde. Art Nouveau attempted to reconcile the extremes of paternalism, eugenics, and socialism. Housing was at once a control mechanism and a tool to uplift and educate the masses. This paper demonstrates how the philanthropic Worker Housing Group and 1903 Housing Exhibition exemplified the tension between theory and practice in the effort to infuse social ideals into modern architecture.

More specifically, the research has two principal objectives: first, to expand the existing conceptual framework of urban movement studies by critically examining the present literature on urban movements and considering peopleâ€™s experiences in the cities of global South; and second, to make an empirical contribution to the literature on urban movements in general and the developing literature on urban movements in Turkey, in particular by analysing political mobilisation surrounding contested urban regeneration projects in Istanbul, Turkey. The thesis argues that the research framework of current urban movementsâ€™ literature is too static and limited to be able to develop a dynamic, relational and comparative approach to the analysis of mobilisation in urban space in different geographies. The case materials presented demonstrate that the political and social relations established between actors of urban politics are enmeshed in a dynamic political process, and that the motivations that inform the development of urban movements can change over time. In addition, the issues causing conflicts and political mobilisation are perceived and experienced differently under different conditions, which results in a diversification of the ways in which mobilisation is pursued. As such, a-priori assumptions about the emergence and goals of political mobilisation in urban space â€“ for example, assumptions that urban movements necessarily are progressive and a part of a wider political agenda â€“ is shown to be inadequate for examining the dynamics of mobilisation in different settings. In developing these theoretical arguments, the research constructs a dynamic relational framework to the analysis of political mobilisation in urban space, contributing in turn to the existing conceptual framework of urban movement and political mobilisation studies. Empirically, these issues were explored through case studies of two urban renewal areas in the historical neighbourhoods of Istanbul, Turkey, using a qualitative Critical Realist methodology. Like many other megacities, Istanbul has experienced an immense process of socio-economic and spatial restructuring in which the state has played a fundamental role. Moreover, in these new urbanisation dynamics, urban renewal projects have become conspicuously contested, leading to mobilisation at a variety of spatial and governmental scales. This thesis focuses on the different responses of local people in two urban renewal areas in order to examine the factors that enable and inhibit mobilisation. Specifically, the research is framed around two contrasting cases: the Fener-Balat-Ayvansaray renewal area, which is taken as a case of political action, and the Suleymaniye renewal area, which is taken as the case of inaction. The research findings show that the intervention of the state is not the only factor causing mobilisation in the localities. Other factors include: the condition of the built environment and the formation of spatial relations in the localities; the condition of the property market and how property owners value their assets in terms of its exchange and use values; the political relations between the state and the residents; social relations within the localities; and the implementation process of the urban renewal projects. These factors are derived from the empirical findings of the research and combined into a dynamic conceptual framework that contributes to reconfiguring existing analyses of urban movements. As such, by its critical relationship to existing urban social movement theory and through its novel methodology, the thesis aims to make significant contributions both to the conceptualisation and empirical analysis of contentious politics in urban space.",1780282019,,Dissertations & Theses," Turkmen, HadeTurkmenHadeTurkmen, Hade", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018889351 , 89355702 , 101309 , 10077573 , 10077573 , http://orca.cf.ac.uk/73541/", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780282019?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://orca.cf.ac.uk/73541/ , (UMI)AAI10077573 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Urban+renewal+projects+and+dynamics+of+contention+in+istanbul%3A+the+cases+of+fener-balat-ayvansaray+and+suleymaniye&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turkmen%2C+Hade&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.6327044,0.927195367,2576,Left,urban/rural questions,the modern urban experience of ghettoization,The greening of Tunis: Ghettoization and the prosaics of piety,"This dissertation explores modern transformations of the cultural landscape and social geography of Tunis, and their imbrication with a shift in the politics, identities, and cultural practices of the urban working class from the 1970s to the present. During this period, the ideological reference points for popular expressions of opposition to the culture and power of the ruling elite have undergone a sea change: from a secular conception of society expressed in terms of class and the rights of workers, to a framework that attributes its authority to religious sources and expresses its claims in terms of Arab-Muslim culture and the requirements of believers. I argue that this shift is a product of the combined social mobility and spatial blockage--ghettoization--experienced by a historically marginalized segment of the city's population. Ghettoization refers to both a process of spatial segmentation observable on the landscape, and a metaphor for the exclusion of certain groups from full integration into the ranks of the regular urban working class. I trace the roots of this spatial segmentation and social exclusion to centuries-old regionalisms, contemporary political conflicts, and current intersections of the local and global political economy. Situated at the confluence of these various streams, ghettoization is a product of social and cultural forces; but it is also in turn a producer of new cultural practices and identities. Religious piety associated with support for Islamist political movements, and expressed in everyday practices--of dress, speech, prayer, and cultural consumption--is a response grounded in the modern urban experience of ghettoization. These expressions constitute a practical politics of identity whereby a modern urban working class in formation is able to rework the modern experience not, as often portrayed, to oppose and reject modernity, but to claim a place within it. The thesis is based on an interpretation of field experience and observations carried out between 1989 and 1991, that focussed primarily on transformations in three marginal neighborhoods as well as in the modern urban core of Tunis.",304156293,,Dissertations & Theses," Vasile, Elizabeth AristieVasileAristieElizabethVasile, Elizabeth Aristie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Structural transformations associated with global capitalism have led to divergent experiences for male and female youth coming of age in the 21 st century. Girls are experiencing greater social integration and social mobility whereas, boys are facing social exclusion and limited opportunities. As young men precariously forge new transitions to adulthood, young women are constructed as ideal flexible subjects, benefiting from feminist achievements, and advancing in the new service economy. Yet in reality, girls continue to face gendered base violence, sexism, and burdens of responsibilities. Through this lens, I examine how gender operates as an organizing principle in young people's lives today in the Lower East Side (LES) of New York City. This study also documents how people create cultural alternatives that reflect their values and progressive politics and analyzes how this has been down in the past. It offers an organizational case study of The Lower Eastside Girls Club in an effort to increase our understanding of the history and significance of a successful struggle to educate, employ, and carve out a safe space for women and girls in neoliberal New York. It documents how the Girls Club builds upon a legacy of grassroots initiatives in the LES, including the settlement house movement of the Progressive Era and Mobilization for Youth of the 1960's. This study asks: what should an education accomplish in a democracy? (Giroux 2013) It examines the limitations of the Girls Club's engaged practice of uplift and empowerment in relation to its progressive politics and critical pedagogy. I suggest that education is a terrain in the ""right to the city"" (Lefebvre 1968), and that the Girls Club, in constructing alternative models of education and community engagement, is locally engaging in a broader struggle for social justice, albeit with limited success. This study concludes with an analysis of Girls Club's efforts to push forth a community-led development model that puts women and youth at the center, melding the politics of Jane Addams and Jane Jacobs and offering an alternative urban vision.",1552723254,,Dissertations & Theses," Sugg, JenniferSuggJenniferSugg, Jennifer", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3400025471 , 87771672 , 66569 , 9781303957543 , 3623360 , 3623360", Dissertation/Thesis,2014,9.78E+12, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1552723254?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies"," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies"," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies",," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies"," Social research , Education , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Education , New york , Urban , Women , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Coming+of+age+in+neoliberal+New+York&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sugg%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9781303957543&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"0.811463481,0.90161328,1476,Left,urban/rural questions,"neoliberal transformations of urban space in Santiago, Chile and Havana, Cuba","MÃ¡s allÃ¡ de los imaginarios neoliberales: Espacio urbano, escritura, y justicia social en Chile y Cuba, 1990â€“2008","This dissertation examines literary representations of the neoliberal transformations of urban space in Santiago, Chile and Havana, Cuba since the 1990s. It draws on the influential work of scholars who argue that throughout the later part of the twentieth century cities have acquired important significance as spaces that register the conflicts that emerge in national contexts and are perpetuated on a global scale by neoliberalism. This dissertation evaluates how the urban imaginaries of Santiago and Cuba have been reshaped since 1990 as a neoliberal reconfiguration of urban space has taken place in each city as a result of important transitions that occur after political and economic crises that have strongly impacted social justice debates. In the Chilean context, it focuses on how neoliberalism was institutionalized with the political transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. In the Cuban context, it focuses on how amidst the economic crisis of the special period, the State began to transition from a socialist planned economy to a mixed system that integrates partially neoliberal policies. This dissertation analyzes how the discourse of the neoliberal market imposes a neoliberal imaginary of Chile as a neoliberal paradise and Cuba as a revolution in ruins. Thus this dissertation examines how those imaginaries are dismantled in Cuban and Chilean literary production. Chapter one analyzes literary representations of the social production of the city in Nancy Alonso's Tirar la primera piedra (Cuba, 1997), RamÃ³n DÃ­az Eterovic's La oscura memoria de las armas (Chile, 2008), Pedro Lemebel's De perlas y cicatrices: crÃ³nicas radiales (Chile, 1998), and Ena LucÃ­a Portela's Cien botellas en una pared (Cuba, 2002). The chapter evaluates how the texts intervene in the social production of postdictatorship Santiago and special period Havana by establishing a relationship between memory, time, and space that opposes the dominant conceptions of these that are established through the neoliberal reconfiguration of urban space. It argues that the texts re-write the city to re-think the possibilities for social change by theorizing memory as a vehicle that constantly elucidates an oppositional re-mapping of the city. Chapter two analyzes literary representations of the act of writing the city in Roberto BolaÃ±o's Estrella distante (Chile, 1996), DÃ­az Eterovic's La oscura memoria de las armas , Ena LucÃ­a Portela's Cien botellas en una pared , and Anna Lidia Vega Serova's Noche de ronda (Cuba, 2001). The chapter revisits the foundational relationship between writing and power in Latin America to examine transformations in the texts' literary depictions of how intellectuals map out Santiago and Havana. It contends that by tracing the relationship between those transformations and the economic and political transformations that have taken place in Chile and Cuba since 1990, the texts situate themselves at the margins of the State and the market as a strategy toward social justice that proposes an alternate relationship to power and knowledge. Chapter three analyzes the literary construction of the act of walking in Alonso's Tirar la primera piedra , Lemebel's De perlas y cicatrices: crÃ³nicas radiales , Karla SuÃ¡rez's Silencios (Cuba, 1997), and Diamela Eltit's JamÃ¡s el fuego nunca (Chile, 2007). The chapter reviews foundational theorizations of the construction of the urban walker to understand the ways in which the neoliberal reconfiguration of postdictatorship Santiago and special period Cuba determines the characters' movement through those cities. It argues that as the characters walk through Santiago and Havana documenting the changesâ€”forms of justice and injusticeâ€”that have taken place since 1990, they not only identify different forms of marginality that have emerged both in public and private spaces but also represent how the reconstruction of urban space inevitably redefines their identities. This dissertation concludes with an analysis of how debates on justice became a central focus in Chile and Cuba since the mid-twentieth century. It explores the ways in which those debates were impacted in Chile by the military coup d'Ã©tat that in 1973 established the dictatorship as the embodiment of injustice, and in Cuba as the success of the 1959 Cuban Revolution was seen as the triumph of justice. It explores how the works make significant interventions in current social justice debates in each country through their focus on the neoliberal reconfiguration of the city. The conclusion argues that the texts dismantle the neoliberal imaginaries of Chile and Cuba to open a space for new theorizations of social justice beyond the limits of the market and the State. It contends that in refuting the neoliberal reconfiguration of their cities the texts propose alternate relationships between time, space, and memory that represent a possibility to conceptualize social justice not as a closed project imposed from above but as a struggle from below that must constantly be redefined to address diverse injustices.

Governance movement has gradually becoming an international phenomenon of developed countries as Europe and the United States and many developing countries. China's urban management practice also reflects the varying degrees the characteristics of urban governance. And many different mode of urban governance have emerged in China. Hangzhou social compound agency, which is widely recognized as an advanced organizational structure to implement governance is a typical example of urban governance practice. This paper is established on the Polycentric urban governance theory and the public policy theory. First, we reviewed the development of urban governance theory, and meanwhile, reviewed China's urban governance theories. Second, we also give a summary of the different Governance indicators and analyzed the practice of governance of domestic and foreign cities. By the two aspects, we have come to the emerging polycentric governance structure and its characteristics. Third, this paper analyzed the characteristics of different kinds of social compound agency, and draws a governance schematic by draw from the polycentric governance structure. On this basis, we compared these two schematics, and defined the social compound as a feasible path to realize urban polycentric governance. Forth, polycentric governance is not only in the abstract field of urban governance, but also reflected in policy implementation, while the urban issuers are emerging.
