Codebook/Decision Rules

“Left” and “right” are woefully inadequate descriptors for all the complicated political currents of social movements. But pattern-detection requires some degree of reduction, so I tried to do this as systematically as possible. TBH this is a super preliminary attempt and I did it on a plane flight so I’m sure there are errors. After reading the title and abstract, I first extracted the specific claim, then grouped it into a meta-claim, and then extrapolated to code as Right or Left. 

Right codes/key words:

-fascism
-conservative
-liberal (European, LatAm Usage);
-reactionary
-traditional society

-classic liberalism
-pro-capital (owners of the means of production, e.g. agribusiness, finance capital, etc.)
-elite causes
-imperialism
-guns/arms (e.g. NRA)

-libertarianism
-small state, privatization

Left codes/key words:

-environmental/green politics (slow or organic food movements, urban agriculture)
-pro-immigrant, migrant, or refugee causes

-feminism
-liberation theology
-right to the city (housing, transportation)
-anti/alter-globalization; counter-hegemony
-racial, ethnic, sexual, or other economic or political minorities (LGBTQ, peasants, indigenous populations, formerly incarcerated, drug users, sex workers, waste-pickers, proletarianism)

-peace/pacifism

-anti-poverty/human development
-pro-labor; union

-citizen participation (participatory budgeting)
-nationalization of industry
-liberal (US usage)

CSR

I classified studies of social corporate responsibility as elite-led movements, and therefore they were categorized by the above decision rule as Right. I don’t expect this to be a consensus code. However, all of the raw and coded data are in this repo, so I welcome pushback and reclassification suggestions ;)

Unknown examples:

Examples of things I coded as unknown (L or R):

—American Zionism and its relation to Progressive Reformism (Justice Brandeis, etc. in US)
—Arab calligraphy
—Open-source software movement
—Militant groups in the Niger Delta

Education:

The education meta-claim had several unknowns. There was one dissertation on the homeschooling movement in the US, but it talked about traditional values and the relationship to conservative Christians, so I took the liberty to code it as Right. But I had no idea what to do with, for example, the Theater-in-Education movement in Taiwan and the Imam-Hatip school movement in Turkey, so I coded them as unknown.
