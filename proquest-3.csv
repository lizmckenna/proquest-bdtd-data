So Marx and Engels had mentioned the impact of first and last impetus and bank's credit to the development of social economy several times in Theses on Feurbach and so on. Lenin also discussed the core status and impact of bank in modern economy, he emphasized ""Bank is the core of modern economy, and is the nerve in all capitalism country's economic system"". Mr. Deng Xiaoping also gradually augmented that finance is the core of modern economy in practice and work for ages. He appointed that ""Finance is very important, is the core of modern economy. If finance is good and alive that all will be alive."" Financial system arrangement must accord to the development of economy, adapt to the requirement of the economy's development, which will efficiently achieve resource configuration best. It is all countries' chasing goal to attain Pareto efficiency. China is out of exception. The development of finance and the structure of credit influence the speed and structure of economic development. It is a very important aspect of building market economy to build modern financial system and construct financial resource configuration mechanism adapting to market economy. The financial domain of china has suffered a series of important and profound innovation since 1970s. China has transformed singular bank of planning economy into kinds of finance passing by reformation and opening for more than 20 years, built and owned a very big bank groups. In the same developing level country, we can say that no one can compare with china in the rate of loan quantity to entire economy. However, we must clearly recognize that the bank system in china is very vulnerable, in which the worried by people is the non-performing loan in bank whose quantity is surprised. Resolve mal-loan problem is much more important to Chinese economic system and decides Chinese economy healthy development or not. According to some specialists, the current financing feature in china resembles to Thailand before financial crisis on some degree, Chinese financing is up to the dangerous. The success to the finance system or not relations to the development of the nation's economic and benefit of every family. Distinctly, Chinese government has recognized the dangers. Finance reforming battle has been starting off. This paper applies Marxist rationale to describe bank's beneficial capital character and effect, expounds primary aim of dealing in banks is to achieve capital increasing, introduces bank facing with kinds of danger, looks back the Chinese financial regimentation' transition, particular to bank. The paper analyses the defect of bank regimentation arrangement in china and all kinds of drawback leading by authority regimentation, describes and analyzes bank's non-performing loan phenomenon and reasons. At the same time, this paper analyses and introduces foreign bank experience to deal with non-performing loan, discusses how to resolve non-performing loan of Chinese banks, and gives the project to reform finance profundity. In economic theory, this paper exerts some theories such as political economics, regime economics, development economics, authority economics, financing, calculation economics, tries to incorporate actuality to provide some better resolving projects for defending and dealing with financial non-performing loan in the procedure of economy transferring of china. This paper is divided into seven chapters, and puts forward own standpoint with suggest thinking from the Marx respectively the reputation theories, non-performing loan operating characters, Chinese banks regimentation arrangement and transition since 1949, Chinese banks non-performing loan's actual state and reasons, the effect of government's will in, the process of the non-performing loan foreign bank experience and lessons to deal with non-performing loan, the countermeasure to resolve non-performing loan problems, and etc. Chapter 1, reputation theories of Marx thinking and bank's property manage. This chapter uses the Reputation theories of Marx thinking to study capital, reputation and bank property managing. In Marx thought extensive work, have to expatiate thoroughly with the reputation mechanism to the capital movement with the argument, and became the ownership of the original theories system in his work. Marx considered, under the economic term in merchandise, every kind of main factors for needing when the merchandise is engaged in the production operates, must pass the market use the way that wait the price commutation then can acquire. For this, any merchandise production that be engaged in the person operates the activity must hold the capital of the certain quantity. Capital that has no certain quantity, can't obtain any kind of main factor that be engaged in the production, and then can't be engaged in the production. Marx got a conclusion for below after analyzed the general trend of capital resources presented in the process of economic development: The first, the capital total amount has continuously enlarging trend. The second, the capital's constant part presents increasing increases trend when compared with variable part. The third, capital ownership and operating power present continuously separated trend. The fourth, the ownership of one's own capital or borrow have the trend to separate from the talent of managing labor. The fifth, the capital quantity in conjecture presents more and more increasing trend. According to these trend, Marx emphasized the reputation system, especially the function of the bank credit, it overcame the localization of the business reputation, no longer restricted by the capital quantity and the capital reflux or fly to of individual capitalist, thereby extended the scope of the reputation, adapt to the demand that capitalism produce, complement and perfect economic movement in capitalism mechanism. With the theoretical research on the reputation for Marx thinking theories, we can thorough understand the living capital, interest, bank, conjecture capital, two powers separate, the extensive problem of the international money flow in the domestic system and reputation system. Then deepen the necessity cognition of establishing the financial system in socialism adapting to the market economy regulation. In this chapter, for the sake of the clear definition of non-performing loan, according to the currency bank theories and finance, we also discuss the modern bank operating mechanism and kinds of risks and endanger in bank operating .Try to let the reader understand the bank have the high risk characteristic, in its management must try to avoid every kind of risk. But the non-performing loan of the bank is the decreasing risk factor in commercial bank's steady management and development. Chapter 2, bank arrangement and change since 1949.This chapter primarily looks back the system arrangement of the Chinese banks and its change since 1949 the People's Republic of China established. Introduces before the 1979 reformation opens, under the planned economy system the frame of the Chinese bank system and function. Specially points out the business characteristics of the Chinese bank in this period: First, credit business highly concentrates in people bank system; Second, savings that all levels bank absorb all ascend to the head office. The loan that all levels bank issue is decided by the head office, strictly issue according to the plan, the grass-roots bank can't use the built-up savings without authorization, can't agree to the loan of the business enterprise. Describe the relation between public finance and the bank's and their position. Then understand under the planned economy system, bank is not the primarily section of funds and resources arrangement, is only a fiscal accountancy and cashier. The position of the bank has been profound influenced on Chinese bank arrangement later. At the same time, in this chapter detailed describes the process of Chinese financial reformation since the reformation open, and the success and experience precept obtained at different periods. Chapter 3, presents condition of non-performing loan in Chinese banks and its influence. A flood of data in this application data was detailed to introduce the Chinese banks face seriously non-performing loan condition. And analyzed the influence on the bank's operating and economy development. Points out the Chinese bank system still can't get away from the harassment of the property quantity up to now, the earnings level is low and have not enough capital ample ratio. If the non-performing loan continues rampant and cannot to control, can't availably resolve the non-performing loan problem of the bank, will bring serious negative influence to financial system and business enterprise or other economic system. But once Chinese banks occurrence crisis, will strike in China economic so larger compare to the other the nation. Chapter 4, analyses the cause of non-performing loan in Chinese banks. From five aspects, this chapter detailed analyzes the reason of non-performing loan in Chinese banks becoming and quantity residing highly. Using the standpoints of the power theories, system economics theories, agency theories and other western economics in etc. this chapter process the thorough meticulous analysis to the formation reason of the non-performing loan and study from points of view. Through the superficial phenomenon of the non-performing loan, analyze the Chinese banking produce power system arrangement, government bank's agency relation, and the blemish on the bank managing construction. It was in many respects to put forward the original views in personally. Chapter 5, explains the relation of government’s will and non-performing loan formation. This chapter emphasizes to point out in the non-performing loan formation reasons of Chinese banking, in addition to the reasons of the power system, entrust agency conflicting, the management construction and social reputation environment mentioned in chapter 4, on a certain extent still under the influence of government behavior. Governmental policy target claim and interfere with bank operating are important reason that the non-performing loan formation of Chinese banking. Therefore, though it can also induce into the Chinese banking non-performing loan formation, writer still list the government behavior relates to with the cause and effecting that non-performing loan formation the conduct and actions alone of a chapter. As the biggest shareholder of the Chinese bank system, government though hope that the management of the bank can bring the larger income, but do not hope the capital run off because of the non-performing loan, even do not hope the crisis of the bank system cause economic crisis and even governmental political crisis. But because of long-term planned economy formation of the path depends and the government target of diverse and limited tenure in official in government, government behavior under the system that is not a complete market and interfere to the bank system, is an important reason that banking non-performing loan formation. Chapter 6, experience and teach of abroad non-performing loan handling. In this chapter, by a flood of abroad source, as the mother country of modern banking, western national bank system though sounder, management norm and laws of sound both already to equal extent, these national banks are not from the first to have the good management construction and operating method, the bank also has many acutely painful lesson in its development process, backlog abundant experience, these experiences and teach deserve us draw lessons from. Also introduces the foreign country concrete measure of handling the non-performing loan. Though the background of all countries non-performing loan formation is different, dealing methods are different, but all have common place: First, its core contents is all to separates non-performing loan management with the good property, down price to sell, the purpose is to digest these non-performing loan as soon as possible. Second, all established the organization to handle the non-performing loan. In fact the quality is a bridge for currency property and real object property. Third, is all to cooperate between banks with government well and effectively, by the way the market and administration can solve the problems of non-performing loan. Chapter 7, explains the countermeasure for defending and dissolving the non-performing loan problem of Chinese banks. This chapter commences the spring of non-performing loan formation begins, setting out from the Chinese state of the nation, aiming at the present condition of the non-performing loan and the Chinese banking reformation trend. Putting forward the non-performing loan defending and dissolving, needing to adopt the way that specimen concurrently cure, at digesting the current non-performing loan, deepening the financial system reformation, making the bank establish the perfect company management mechanism, at the same time establishing its kit matches the laws of the market economy regulation, creating good market environment, make the bank become the propose of the real independent market corpus. Proceed the reformation in all aspects, the acquisition breaks in laws and the kit of the power system, promoting the bank oneself win the benefit ability, realizing the target of the management that profits maximize, then attain the purpose of digesting the exist non-performing loan and avoid large quantity new non-performing loan creation. Among them, concerning the power construction, perfect company management and sound market environment, all have the realistic meaning.",1026879196, 中国银行业不良资产问题研究,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, DongLiuDongLiu, Dong刘东", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714619541 , 70604932 , 189128 , H399237 , H399237", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国银行业不良资产问题研究,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026879196?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH399237 , Social sciences , Chinese banks , loan , non-performing , study , 不良资产 , 中国银行业 , 问题研究",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+OF+the+Chinese+Bank%60s+NPL&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Dong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A STUDY ON TOURISM CREDIT,"Tourism industry plays an important role in developing economy in our country and is becoming the pillar and a new point of economic growth in our civil economy. In real life, a crisis about tourism credit has showed, especially credit lack of tourism enterprises has caused a lot of appeal and thus restricting tourism development of our country healthily. The problem of tourism credit has aroused the whole society and managing department related to pay great attention to it. The national tourism bureau advances we should push construction of trust in tourism and design a frame of tourism credit system as soon as possible. In practice, some regional managing departments and guilds in tourism have begun to build credit system of tourism enterprise. Few scholars have discussed it as well. As a whole, the study on the problem is in an initial stage and lacks an in-depth academic study. So, the problem has become a new task that needs to research it urgently. It not only can provides theoretic foundation and actual guidance and thus improves the international competitive force of tourism industry in our country, but also can help to enhance moral level of whole society and shape a well social fashion, and to accelerate a era of credit economy to come and build a harmonious society. Therefore, the study has an important theoretic meaning and a practical significance. The analyzing process follows common rules of economics that puts forward a problem and then analyzes it and solves it. On the basis of credit theories, the paper first studies some basic general situation about tourism credit, and then stresses analyses on actions of the government, enterprise and individual that include defining on their action boundaries, behavior of credit lack and causes of credit lack. Finally, the paper puts forward countermeasures solving the problem of tourism credit, namely, construction of system of tourism credit. The structure and contents of the paper are as follows. Chapter 1 is about the origin of theory on tourism credit. The study on tourism credit is part of social credit system and it roots in credit study. The paper hackles some credit theories that relate to tourism credit. These theories include Marks’ theories such as credit and credit relation, commercial credit and bank credit and credit system, the traditional credit theories in the western countries such as credit agent theory, credit creation theory and credit adjustment theory, and the modern credit theories such as non-symmetrical information theory, dealing cost theory and game theory, and so on. They establish bases for study on tourism credit. Chapter 2 is a conspectus on tourism credit. In order to build a frame of study on tourism credit, the paper undertakes researches on some basic general situation, for example, concept defining of tourism credit and its characteristic and its types, and tourism credit system. It is an analysis on credit actions of the main body of tourism credit from chapter 3 to chapter 5. Credit action is an action that people behave in economic company according to the principles and demands and criterion of credit, including possession and acceptance and performance of right. So, to a great extent, analyses of credit are analyses of credit action. The main body of tourism credit includes tourism enterprise and tourism individual and the government. Because tourism industry possesses characteristics of strong all-around property, bigger associated degree and vast involved aspects, credit action of the main body of tourism credit are more complex than the others. For instance, tourism enterprises credit include various enterprises such as travel agency, hotel, tourism traffic, tourism shop and scenic spots; individual credit include both practitioners credit and tourists credit. Various main bodies of tourism credit act differently, so we need to study them deeply. The paper anatomizes their credit actions in detail applying to some theories of economy and tourism science. Chapter 3 is a study on government credit of tourism. Government credit of tourism is the key in tourism credit system and has a demonstrating effect. Its credit depends on its function. If the functions of the government define dully, the government lacks credit easily. So, first, the paper defines the functions and action boundaries of the government in developing tourism in a great deal sections, and then the paper analyzes various credit problems of the government applying some economic theories. For instance, the policies of tourism are random and dark, its deeds are unfair and inequity, its deeds depend on official will, and its deeds take on a trend of seeking economic profits and a ism of regional protection causes credit lack. Eventually the paper discusses causes of credit lack of the government. The causes sum up as follows: there existed limitations of system in the period of transition in China, the functions of the government have produced dissimilation, a phenomenon called district economy results in credit lack of the government, the government itself looks after profits, and lawful restrictions intenerate and system construction lags in our country. Chapter 4 is a study on enterprise credit of tourism. As a main part of economic movement of tourism, credit actions of tourism enterprises become the main body of tourism credit naturally. Among whole system of tourism credit, credit of tourism enterprise is crucial. Credit actions of tourism enterprise are manifested by the actions of price, sales promotion, service and competition. In tourism market, credit lacks of the enterprises in China include payment in arrears, various credit lacks such as tourism contract bargaining, quality of service, shopping, capital, sales promotion and price, and counterfeit. The factors of credit lack of the enterprises include the factors of system, market, information, culture, management and law, and so on. Chapter 5 is a study on individual credit tourism. Individual credit of tourism is a base among tourism credit system. The chapter includes two parts. Part one studies credit action, credit lack behavior and causes of credit lack of individual credit tourism. Part two discusses development of consumption credit of tourism. Chapter 6 is a study on construction of credit system of tourism. To solve tourism credit lack, the key is to build a system of tourism credit. On the basis of experience about construction of credit system in developed countries and other callings in our country, combined characteristics of tourism itself, the paper undertakes a study how to build tourism credit system. They include both construction of ethics criterion and the lawful environments in macro-lay and credit system construction of tourism enterprise, tourism individual and the government in micro-lay. The main conclusions of the paper are as follows:1、We should build moral standard of tourism credit from these aspects of increasing effective supply of system, doing well moral construction of the officials, doing well public moral construction of society, strengthening professional moral construction of tourism, and shaping a criterion of club. 2、A lawful system construction of tourism credit includes legislation and executing the law of credit and establishing a punishment mechanism for credit lack. 3、Countermeasures on building credit system of tourism enterprise in our country include establishing system of property right, credit evaluation, credit management, credit encouragement and punishment and proclamation, and credit culture, and bringing into play function of guild. 4、Countermeasures on building credit system of tourism individual include creating a nicer surrounding of social credit, building system of evaluation and management of individual credit and strengthening education.5、Countermeasures on building government credit include changing its function, standardizing its actions, changing its concept of credit, promoting moral making and administrative level of the officials, making evaluation system more perfect, building self-contained law system, and bringing into play function of guild. On the basis of absorbing the former fruit, innovative points of the paper are as follows: Firstly, a study thinking of combining different subject. As the study on tourism credit is a new field combined economics and tourism science, the paper studies it using a method combined different subject. Secondly, putting forward a new concept. Based on concept of credit, the paper puts forwards concept of tourism credit from the angle of broad sense and researches it roundly. Thirdly, establishing a system of tourism credit that includes enterprise, individual and the government. In the system, individual credit is a base, enterprise credit is a center, and government credit is a core and key. Fourthly, defining action boundaries of government credit of tourism. There have been a lot of disposals at all times about the function of the government in developing tourism. The paper considers that its main functions are macro-management, harmony and supervision and service at present according to the situation of our country. Namely, action boundaries of the government are limited to the following aspects: cultivating perfect system of tourism market, eliminating exterior non-economy, keeping competition and opposing monopoly, providing public products of tourism, rectifying non-symmetrical information of tourism, establishing and performing tourism law, and carrying out tourism regulations. Fifthly, building evaluation system of tourism enterprise. Sixthly, the paper carries through study on individual credit of tourism from the angle of moral credit and capital credit. The paper needs to study problems in-depth: 1.To analyze the problem in-depth by applying a method of game theory. 2.

On one hand, the geographical environment plays an important role in the formation and development of a city; on the other hand, the social economic activities of human beings constantly convert the geographical environment. The two parts interacts on each other. In Wuhan, the geographical environment influences profoundly on urban modernization construction in the early stage and the modernization construction in 1990s as well as the construction to build up a sustainable development city in a new century. Accordingly, the study of how the geographical environment (especially after the Opium War) has affected the urban social economic development of Wuhan, is of great importance and referential value in the urban economic overall arrangement, the space for development, the construction of ecological environment, the harmony between nature and man, and the realization of sustainable development in the future. In this dissertation, the geographical environment consists of natural geographical environment and humanistic geographical environment. The former refers to the regional characteristics, the regional disintegration and variation, the process of formation and development as well as the rules of changes in the natural environment on the surface of the earth where human beings live. It includes those natural factors such as hydrology, climate, rocks, physiognomy, soil and environment. The latter comprises the social and cultural environment, political environment, economic arrangement environment, population and residence and city environment. The dissertation consists of seven chapters, which are respectively introduced in the following paragraphs. In chapter one I introduce the relationship between the geographical environment and the historical changes of the three towns in Wuhan. From the characteristics of geology, physiognomy, climate, hydrology and land structure as well as the geographical predominance, it is concluded that the natural geographical environment in Wuhan is generally composed of plains accounting for 40%, ridges and hummock 40%, hilly areas 0.5% and mountainous areas 0.5%. What is more, there exist rainy seasons with the high temperature, mass rainfall, low-lying terrains, many rivers and lakes in the city proper, frequent flood and watercourse changes. All these above greatly influence and restrict the formation and development of the three towns in Wuhan. Because of the geographical situation that Wuchang and Hanyang are situated at the hilly and mountainous areas and beside Yangtze River, the two towns are the earliest to be built up and become critical military towns and later commercial centers. The transfer of the commercial center afterwards is closely related with the up and downs of Shazhou river area of Yangtze River. The change of Han River watercourse causes the buildup of Hankou. Han River changes its watercourse from the south of Guishan Mountain and winds its way northwards, so that Hankou is separated from Hanyang. Commercial ships swarm there and Hankou develops to become an independent town. This chapter also analyzes and remarks on how those favorable conditions such as the central location, the link to the sea by way of rivers and the vast central region have benefited the development of Wuhan. In chapter two I analyze the influence of the geographical environment upon the construction and development of Wuhan. Because of the mass rainfall and the brooky rivers and lakes, flood becomes the greatest threat to its development. Therefore, damming, restoring the dykes, earth filling and groundwork building must be the steady steps in the urban construction to safeguard the living environment of the city. This chapter expatiates the influence of several major damming constructions in the history upon the development of Wuhan and the improvement of the city functions. Hanzheng Street comes into being alongside the river with the change of Hanshui River watercourse. It expands gradually and turns into the earliest commercial center and the collecting and distributing trade center of land and water in Hankou. As the change of the major watercourse of Yangtze River and the evolvement of Jiangxinzhou river area transform the ports in Wuhan, the industrial overall arrangement is accordingly modified and the economic center transferred. Focusing on the effect on the changes of Wuhan ports by the up and downs of Parrot river area and Liugong river area, the change of Han River watercourse and the formation of Tianxing river area, this chapter points out that in different historical periods, the natural geographical environment has bigger or smaller effects on the development of Wuhan city with social economic progresses. In chapter three I discuss the influence on urban development brought by the first opening of Yangtze River-side areas and the ports in Hankou in 1860s. Firstly, this chapter analyses the natural geographical factors and the humanistic geographical factors of Wuhan, such as convenient transportation, the link to the sea by way of rivers, vast central region and prosperous commerce and the influence on the ports opening by the rather complete built-up dam constructions. Secondly, this chapter discusses that the opening of ports brings about a great many foreign investments and changes the economic and trade structure in Wuhan, so that this city turns from a feudalistic town into a semi- colonial and semi- feudalistic modern city. After the opening of the ports, the emergence of concessions has two facets. On one hand, it is invasive; on the other hand, it changes the economic character in Wuhan. Thirdly, this chapter studies the geographical factor that the built-up Lugou Bridge-to-Wuhan Railway turns Wuhan into a center of Westernization Movement. The main reason is that Henan and Hubei province are located in the central region of China and Lugou Bridge-to-Wuhan railway is useful for developing the resources in the midland as well as linking to the shipping in Yangtze River and making full use of military transport of railways. The buildup of Lugou Bridge-to-Wuhan railway improves the overall arrangement of modern iron and steel industry, military industry, mechanical industry and textile industry. The development of foreign enterprises and westernized enterprises bring along the development of the national industry and commerce, and then change the economic structure and ownership structure in Wuhan. Therefore, the structure of pluralized-economic development comes into being with the co-existence of foreign enterprises, state-owned enterprises and individually-run enterprises. All these enforce the economic strength and enhance the economic geographical advantage in Wuhan. In chapter four, I discuss the influences of geographical situation on neoteric Wuhan to become the political center of the country. Since the Opium War, Wuhan has begun to play an important role in several momentous transformations in Chinese modern history and become the political center several times. Except for the political and economic factors, geographical situation also has a considerable effect. The success of the first uprising in Wuchang of The Revolution of 1911(the Chinese Bourgeois Democratic Revolution) is tightly related to the terrain features as well as the important district position of Wuchang: situated on Yangtze River in the west side, Wuchang has a low and plain landform crossed with hills, rivers and lakes, which actually made no key posts in military actions and provides the favorable conditions for the first uprising in Wuchang to succeed; the Lugou bridge-to-Wuhan Railway being open to traffic and the development of neoteric Wuhan industry and commerce laid material foundations for The Revolution of 1911; being for long a territorial political center, Wuchang was provided with the humanistic and social environment for the success of the first uprising in Wuchang. In this chapter, I expatiate on both the reconstruction of Wuhan after The Revolution of 1911 and Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s tentative plan of the modernization of urban Wuhan, which gives prominence to Wuhan’s geographical predominance and shows its significant status in the whole country. Also, I make detailed analysis on the geographical background both when the Nationalist Government established Wuhan as the capital of the state after The Revolution of 1911 and during the Wuhan Battle in the Anti-Japanese War, and hence the social、economic influences that were brought about upon Wuhan. In chapter five, I further analyze the influence of the geographical environment in the mid Republic of China (1912-1949) upon the social economic development of Wuhan. From the aspects of analyzing natural resource conditions and city humanistic environment, I discuss the factors that caused the fall of Wuhan external trade in the 1930s, also do I probe into the geographical factors which made Wuhan a transfer station for the national industry to move into the hinterland in the Anti-Japanese War period. In chapter six, I place emphasis on analyzing the interaction between geographical environment and the economic development of Wuhan during the period from the foundation of P.R.C to 1980s. From the first “five-year plan” to the fifth one, by reason of its geographical location (in the middle part of the country), convenient transportation and its rich water resources, Wuhan has become a heavy industrial city in the strategic constructions of the country, and it has built a large group of key industrial enterprises and inaugurates a block of industrial zones. The constructions of bridges and embankments not only change the separated pattern of the three towns but also improve the internal environment of urban development, meantime the construction of the embanking and cultivating project around the East West Lake build a new pattern of urban industry overall arrangement. In the same period, as the result of practicing single planned economy, the effect of Wuhan’s geographical predominance on its role as a financial and commercial center is artificially weakened. In the early 80s, when the state put into practice the strategy of opening the coastal cities, Wuhan re-examined and gave full play of its geographical predominance, established a strategy of “The Two Communications” which had transport and circulation as its breakthrough points, thus it resumed its central role in transportation and trade in the middle part of the country. In chapter seven, I further elaborate on the great influence that the strategy of opening the riverside in the 1990s has brought upon the urban development of Wuhan. Advantaged by this opening, Wuhan has stepped out from an inland city towards a modernized and internationalized city, and with the further prominence of its geographic geographical predominance as connecting nine provinces as well as the sea, Wuhan has again become a focal point of foreign investment, thus came into being the Wuhan East Lake High Technological Development Zone, Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone (Zhuankou) and Wujiashan Taiwan Merchants Investment Zone (East West Lake). Great changes have taken place in the economic structure of Wuhan: from the traditional structure with heavy industry、chemistry and textile as the principle parts, to the new structure mainly with steel、automobile、electromechanical and new material industries; foreign enterprises have played an important role in promoting the industrial structure. The Three Gorges Project changed the geographic environment for the development of Wuhan: in one hand, it strengthened Wuhan’s capability of flood control, promoted its level of flood control, brought forth formidable electric power and augmented its traffic and transportation capacity; in the other hand, it brought along the development of correlative industries. In the late 1990s, as the state actualized the strategy of Grand Exploration of the West, Wuhan showed even more its outstanding geographical predominance and became the transfer station for the industries of eastern area to transfer and for the foreign investments to move into the west. While the urban construction of Wuhan is striding forward towards a scenic garden city sharing the beauty of hills and lakes, the city’s specially characterized natural environment has already exhibited its own value. The conjunction of the two rivers made bridge construction the most critical of all the important urban constructions, hence these bridges became both passages for traffic and transportation and great sights in the riverside and lakeside areas. Densely covered with rivers and lakes and universally intersected with low mountains and hills, Wuhan has the natural conditions to provide material foundation to constructing a scenic garden city with the beauty of hills and lakes. The silt in the northern shore, which was caused by the swaying movement of the mainstream of Yangtze River, offered material source for the construction of river beaches. In concomitance with the entrance into the new century, the geographic environment of Wuhan provide important guarantees for fastening the economic growth, transforming the mode of economic growth and realizing the sustainable development of social economy. To sum up, we can make a general conclusion that, on one hand, the development of Wuhan’s economy depends mainly on its inner economic and social factors; on the other hand, it also benefits from Wuhan’s predominant geographical conditions. Situated by the hills and rivers, prospered by the river conditions, enlarged by the embanking constructions, open and unobstructed by the bridgeworks, beautified by the surrounding lakes, Wuhan has become the financial and commercial center in Central China resorting to its geographical predominance, and it became the scene of the first uprising in the Revolution of 1911 as well as the political center of the Republic of China (1912-1949) resorting to its humanistic conditions and central geographical locations. Wuhan is now facing the opportunities and challenges of the new century, we have the responsibility to carefully learn from the experiences of history developments, fasten the pace of reform and opening to the world, give full play to the geographical predominance, thus build Wuhan into a modernized international metropolis in Central China.",1026933407, 鸦片战争以来武汉城市社会经济发展与地理环境,Dissertations & Theses," Zeng, Hong YanZengYanHongZeng, Hong Yan曾艳红", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715195861 , 70606732 , 189128 , H411321 , H411321", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese, 鸦片战争以来武汉城市社会经济发展与地理环境,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026933407?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," (UMI)AAIH411321 , Social sciences , Wuhan , geographical environment , since the Opium War , sustainable development , urban society and economy , 可持续发展 , 地理环境 , 武汉 , 社会与经济 , 鸦片战争以来",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Urban+Social+Economic+Development+and+the+Geographical+Environment+of+Wuhan+Since+the+Opium+War&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zeng%2C+Hong+Yan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Understand The War News From the Iraqi War,"This text bases on two basic points: The classical theory of the news dissemination and news report of Iraqi war. On the basis of this, from various angles, such as news, military, politics, economy, culture, etc., it probes into the essence of war news study. In the high-tech war in information age, the news media has already become an important part of war. It has changed its status from an observer and a note-taker into a participant and an assistant. In modern wars, news has already become a kind of war weapon. The increasing combination of War and news is caused by the close relation among war form, social form and propagate form. These three forms have their own important signs, and provide prerequisite of mutual utilization. War news means reports on latest war and interrelated social activities under special war period and statuses of war. The essential feature of war news was taken shape to the contradiction movement by its inherent four. Namely freedom and control, open and secret, true and false, Objective and trend, they blend, permeate and influence each other, maintain close ties each other. Among them, the contradiction of "" freedom "" and"" control"" is in power."" Freedom "" means the dissemination of news, but"" control"" requires just the opposite. "" freedom"" and"" control"", become the core of the news contradiction of the war. The Iraqi war news report shows the community responsibility of media. Among obeying the war and media intuitive knowledge between the two, the journalists are making a difficult choice. Whether the western media under the believe of community responsibility will fall into chaos after the Iraqi war, is a question that needs to be answered. The Iraqi war has a enormous impact on world media industry, it mainly Shows in the following aspects: First, the news competition within the whole world makes a set of famous war journalists enter people's vision; Second, the world propagates pattern has no great changes, Western media's monopoly is broken, many sounds and a pattern of world is taking shape, in the media of a batch of the Arab world and developing countries, there is original behavior; Third, the media function in the war report of the network is gotten apparently, the strength of"" the fourth media"" begins to have approval. This text thinks, the Iraqi war gives us a warning that under the background of economic globalization, if China wants to win in the global competition of culture, economy, military etc, a long-term strategy of mass media and a strong media battle array should be built.",1026935677, 从伊拉克战争解读“战争新闻”,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Hua WeiLiWeiHuaLi, Hua Wei李韦华", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715133591 , 70604742 , 189128 , H402758 , H402758", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese, 从伊拉克战争解读“战争新闻”,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026935677?accountid=14496, 0391 Journalism, 0391 Journalism, 0391 Journalism,, 0391 Journalism, Journalism," (UMI)AAIH402758 , Communication and the arts , Community responsibility , Iraqi war , The country propagates strategy , The fourth media , War news , 伊拉克战争 , 国家传播战略 , 战争新闻 , 社会责任 , 第四媒体",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understand+The+War+News+From+the+Iraqi+War&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Hua+Wei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Aliens en route: european transmigration through britain, 1836-1914","This thesis discusses the agencies, transport systems, and infrastructure that enabled more than 3.15 million Europeans to emigrate to the United States, Canada, and South Africa through Britain between 1836 and 1914. Rather than travelling directly from the European mainland, these transmigrants broke their journeys by travelling to Britain where they boarded another vessel that conveyed them across the Atlantic. The control that Britain exerted over both the short-sea and long-haul passenger routes thus involved was as important to British maritime commerce as similar controls over freight or direct long-haul passenger routes to the far-flung corners of the British Empire. However the crucial significance of the transmigrant business to the British merchant marine has been largely overlooked in recent historiography, and it is this lacuna that the present dissertation seeks to redress. The study is split into three sections. The first part quantifies the patterns of the transmigrant business, answering questions such as: what were the origins of the migrants and what routes did they use to reach Britain? When did they come? Where in Britain did they land, where were they bound, and where did they re-embark? Having charted these issues, the thesis turns in the second section to investigate how the transmigrant business developed and evolved, paying particular attention to the factors that conditioned the market throughout the 78 year period. Finally, the thesis examines the significance of the transmigrant business to British ports serving as conduits for the passenger movement, to the companies involved in transporting the aliens, and to the migrants themselves. By exploring these issues this thesis has made a significant contribution to migrant and maritime historiography in the following ways. First, it has broadened the chronological and geographical focus of migrancy back from the 1880s to the 1830s and stressed Scandinavian as well as Central/East European movements. Second, it has demonstrated how European transmigrants were as important to British shipping companies as were British emigrants seeking to settle in Britain's overseas dominions. Third, immigration to Britain has been incorrectly conceptualised because historians and social commentators fail to take account of the onward movement of aliens arriving in Britain and assume instead that most were permanent settlers. Fourth, the primacy of Britain's maritime links to the United States was more important for the passenger business than has been previously acknowledged. Finally, this study disproves theories by immigrant historians that centres of alien settlement across Northern Britain arose because they were situated along the transmigrant corridor between the Humber and Mersey. In reality many of the trains carrying transmigrants never passed through the towns and cities where large-scale immigration took place. By combining a mixture of global, national and local studies, and a longer chronology, this thesis offers an important intersection of transport and maritime studies that shows how transmigration has been under appreciated by both maritime and migrants historians alike.",1314572363,,Dissertations & Theses," Evans, Nicholas J.EvansJ.NicholasEvans, Nicholas J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907912321 , 45116661 , 101309 , U563889 , U563889 , http://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:8092", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314572363?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," http://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:8092 , 529012 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Aliens+en+route%3A+european+transmigration+through+britain%2C+1836-1914&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Evans%2C+Nicholas+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Remapping women's movements, rethinking feminist politics in South Korea (1980s-1990s): links and tensions between the local, the national, and the global.","This research aims to reconstruct feminist politics by exploring the exclusion of local women's experiences within women's movements, which are constructed within the wider national and global context, and by considering how to include them within the feminist politics in South Korea (hereafter Korea). It is based on the case study of women's organisations in Taejon city using feminist oral history interviews, focusing on the transitional period including the authoritarian period (the 1980s) and the democratisation era (the 1990s). The main concerns of this research are: In what ways and contexts are local women's experiences excluded from Korean feminist politics and how to include them. This thesis is a critique as well as a reconstruction. While criticising an exclusive feminist politics based on dichotomous discourse, it suggests possible ways to include local women's experiences within the feminist politics. The inclusion of local women's experiences considers three themes based on feminist citizenship theory: the politicisation of the personal, the politicisation of the local, and the creation of inclusive/transversal politics. Firstly, it explores Korean feminist dichotomous discourse between the new progressive feminist activism and the old conservative non-feminist activism. Current feminist discourse caught in this dichotomy functions to exclude local women's experiences and their activism framed largely under the influence of conservative non-feminist activism. Testimonies of local women disprove this feminist dichotomy and blur the fixed boundaries between feminist and non-feminist groups. Secondly, this thesis examines the social context of local women's exclusion, situating their experiences within the context of development policy at national and global levels. Local women's voices demonstrate that the shifting boundaries between different women's groups are constructed within the context of development policy at both of these levels.",301642703,,Dissertations & Theses," Hur, S.HurS.Hur, S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760555831 , 45086391 , 101309 , U199978 , U199978", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301642703?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN091970 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Remapping+women%27s+movements%2C+rethinking+feminist+politics+in+South+++Korea+%281980s-1990s%29%3A+links+and+tensions+between+the+local%2C+the+national%2C+and+the+global.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hur%2C+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Cross-examining suggestibility: memory, childhood, expertise","Initially a central topic for psychology, suggestibility has been forgotten, rediscovered, evaded definition, sabotaged experimentation and persistently triggers epistemological short-circuits when interconnecting psychological questions of memory, childhood and scientificity, with concrete legal issues of child witnesses' credibility, the disclosure of sexual abuse and psychological expertise in courts of law. The aim of this study is to trace suggestibility through history, theory, research and practice, and to explore its efficacy at the intersection of psychology and law, by examining and comparing the. concrete case of child witness practice in England and Germany. Taking a transdisciplinary approach the study draws on two interrelated sources of 'data' combining historical, theoretical and research literature with the analysis of empirical data. A genealogy if theory and research is combined with the results of reflexive interviews, conducted in England and Germany with practitioners from all those professions involved in creating, applying or dealing with knowledge about child witnesses and suggestibility: judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers, psychologists (researchers, experts) and social workers. Drawing on the work of G. Deleuze and 1. Stengers this study shows how practical tensions around reliable witnesses, evidence and expertise merge pragmatically with theoretical movements employed to adjust the discipline, thereby causing frictions and voids. In this sense suggestibility provides a liminal resource: It transgresses disciplinary boundaries and pervades pragmatic and theoretical, global and personal, historical and actual considerations, creating voids that allow us to reconsider the pragmatics of change and to redefine the issue of critical impact, as well as to reformulate the problem of child witness practice and children's suggestibility. The study hopes to make a concrete contribution to facilitating the just prosecution of sexual abuse by adding transparency to the complex and at times unhelpfully polarised field of child witness practice. By exploring the 'pragmatics of change' the study furthermore hopes to give an unsettling and productive impetus to theoretical debates within critical approaches to psychology.",301651021,,Dissertations & Theses," Motzkau, Johanna F.MotzkauF.JohannaMotzkau, Johanna F.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761407291 , 45245801 , 101309 , U239603 , U239603 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/16106", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301651021?accountid=14496, 0621 Psychology, 0621 Psychology, 0621 Psychology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0621 Psychology, Psychology," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/16106 , DXN118800 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cross-examining+suggestibility%3A+memory%2C+childhood%2C+expertise&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Motzkau%2C+Johanna+F.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"In negara kangguru: indonesian organizations in australia,"The central claim of this thesis is that, transnational movement, and the increasing globalisation of capital and geopolitics notwithstanding, the logic and rhetoric of nation-­states remains a primary point of reference for much lived social experience.  Through an examination of Indonesian organisations in Sydney, Australia, the thesis explores the nature and implications of nationalism in a world increasingly characterised by cross­-border migration.  I show that Indonesian migrants are challenged with negotiating between the twin gravities of Indonesian and Australian national imaginaries.  I trace the relationship expatriate Indonesians form with diplomatic and consular authorities outside national territorial boundaries.  I also take account of the particular bilateral atmosphere following the Bali bombings in October 2002. As a migrant minority in multicultural Australia, Indonesian engagement with the Australian state authorities occurs largely through the language of cultural identity.  Indonesians' participation in such conversations is commonly predicated on state recognition of their coherence as a group, and their consequent difference from others.  Through a series of ethnographic case studies, I examine ways in which the quality of 'lndonesianness', struggling with the discrepancy between ethnos and nation, is expressed through organisational membership, and presented in a broader public sphere.  In so doing, the thesis highlights the tendency in policy contexts to elide and naturalise concepts of 'ethnic group', 'migrant community' and formal organisation.  It argues that more attention should be paid to the internal constitution of migrant organisations, especially given their central role in welfare service provision for marginal groups.  I suggest that a more informed approach to migrant 'micro -politics' requires an understanding of the relationship between organisational structure and forms of national and regional belonging.",301651638,,Dissertations & Theses," Frost, Nicola JaneFrostJaneNicolaFrost, Nicola Jane", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760701951 , 45115851 , 101309 , U213316 , U213316", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301651638?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," DXN099402 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+negara+kangguru%3A+indonesian+organizations+in+australia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Frost%2C+Nicola+Jane&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An inquiry into the creative process of butoh: with reference to the implications of eastern and western significances,"This thesis investigates the creative processes of Butoh choreography. A phenomenological perspective is used in this thesis to explore the implications for choreographers of the choreographic options employed in Butoh creative processes. Phenomenology corresponds to the Japanese philosophical context which gave birth to Butoh, elucidating the worldview merging with the universe which underpins Butoh. In terms of phenomenology, merging with the universe is firstly understood as a state of inter-subjectivity or transcendental consciousness, and secondly as the interweaving through actions of individual woridviews and a greater world of shared socio-cultural significances contributed by different people. The inter-subjective relationship between self, other self and objects is used to examine and elucidate the juxtaposition of various kinds of imagery in Butoh. The phenomenological notion of actions is used to examine bodily movement with respect to a greater world in Butoh. Phenomenology particularly corresponds to some of the fundamental processes used by Butoh choreographers. The choreographers' initial options for treating materials, namely visceral sensations as media for merging with the universe, texts as media for perception, paintings as media for presenting images, and actions as building blocks of an inter-subjective world, are inclined to guide the creative processes to develop the manifold of a spiritual imagery and bodily actions. These options and treatments are elucidated in this thesis through the network of perception and the phenomenological notion of graded fulfillment. The choreographer's treatment of the materials requires that the network of perception operates differently for different materials. The results of the operations are then integrated by the choreographer, through a process of graded fulfillment, into a holistic perception of the imagery or into a greater world, of which every image on stage is a part. In contrast the dialectical choreographic options, namely texts as tools for reasoning, paintings as representative structures of the subjects, and actions as representative units of social structure and cultural patterns, are inclined to guide the choreographers towards a focus on the development of formalised postures and gestures. The dialectical options are underpinned by rationalist, sociological or anthropological perspectives. It is argued that both the initial and dialectical options have value. The initial and dialectical options have co-existed and merged over the course of Butoh's development. Through their use different significances are incorporated into dance through the creative processes. Those significances can be identified as mainly rooted in Eastern philosophy, but later expanded to include Western philosophy when Butoh began to develop in a global context. Accordingly, Butoh creative processes are enriched by the use of a variety of choreographic options and by incorporating viewpoints from different people and perspectives.",301669857,,Dissertations & Theses," Liao, P.LiaoP.Liao, P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

The theoretical framework for creative critical technology evolved from the confluence of the arts, human computer interaction, and critical theories of technology. Molding this nascent theoretical framework from these seemingly disparate disciplines was a reflexive process where the influence of each component on each other spiraled into the theory and practice as illustrated through the Constructed Narratives project. Research that evolves from an arts perspective encourages experimental processes of making as a method for defining research principles. The traditional reductionist approach to research requires that all confounding variables are eliminated or silenced using methods of statistics. However, that noise in the data, those confounding variables provide the rich context, media, and processes by which creative practices thrive. As research in the arts gains recognition for its contributions of new knowledge, the traditional reductive practice in search of general principles will be respectfully joined by methodologies for defining living principles that celebrate and build from the confounding variables, the data noise. The movement to develop research methodologies from the noisy edges of human interaction have been explored in the research and practices of ludic design and ambiguity (Gaver, 2003); affective gap (Sengers et al., 2005b; 2006); embodied interaction (Dourish, 2001); the felt life (McCarthy &amp; Wright, 2004); and reflective HCI (Dourish, et al., 2004). The theory of critical creative technology examines the relationships between critical theories of technology, society and aesthetics, information technologies and contemporary practices in interaction design and creative digital media. The theory of critical creative technology is aligned with theories and practices in social navigation (Dourish, 1999) and community-based interactive systems (Stathis, 1999) in the development of smart appliances and network systems that support people in engaging in social activities, promoting communication and enhancing the potential for learning in a community-based environment. The theory of critical creative technology amends these community-based and collaborative design theories by emphasizing methods to facilitate face-to-face dialogical interaction when the exchange of ideas, observations, dreams, concerns, and celebrations may be silenced by societal norms about how to engage others in public spaces. The Constructed Narratives project is an experiment in the design of a critical creative technology that emphasizes the collaborative construction of new knowledge about one's lived world through computer-supported collaborative play (CSCP). To construct is to creatively invent one's world by engaging in creative decision-making, problem solving and acts of negotiation. The metaphor of construction is used to demonstrate how a simple artefact - a building block - can provide an interactive platform to support discourse between collaborating participants. The technical goal for this project was the development of a software and hardware platform for the design of critical creative technology applications that can process a dynamic flow of logistical and profile data from multiple users to be used in applications that facilitate dialogue between people in a real-time playful interactive experience.",301725565,,Dissertations & Theses," Jennings, Pamela LynnetteJenningsLynnettePamelaJennings, Pamela Lynnette", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760939031 , 45155881 , 101309 , U230747 , U230747 , http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/2619", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301725565?accountid=14496, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0344 Social research, Social research," http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/2619 , DXN096639 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interactive+technologies+for+the+public+sphere%3A+toward+a+theory+of+critical+creative+technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jennings%2C+Pamela+Lynnette&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Caught in-between: Exploring the complexities of school vandalism. Case study research in Kenya,"School violence in Kenya has developed from wanton walkouts to planned and premeditated incidences of vandalism which have been tragic and led to millions loss of school property. The main purpose of this study is to seek for a deeper understanding into the occurrence of school vandalism within the Kenyan school context and perhaps explore why the various initiatives being undertaken by the government and the independent organisations have not been effective in controlling or preventing the menace. In order to achieve, the objectives of the study, we purposefully sampled for a case study that had a history of school vandalism and 31 respondents. We discovered, that the vandalism at Kusasi was a very complex phenomenon which was embedded in the social-cultural, political, economical and historical aspects in the school but also to a large extent flowing from their influences in the post-colonial society. By discussing the movements of the public school in this society we contend that the youth are caught in-between and the vandalism is a form of 'tactical agency' (Certeau, 1984) in their struggle to emerge from these forces which are beyond their control. As Garbarino (1998) posits the society today is toxicated, and there is an impeding clash between cultures as the older generation insist on using authoritarian models in dealing with the phenomenon. By posing critical questions on the events and crisis in the post-colonial society, we show that indeed these societies are caught in-between as they attempt to embrace the global trends. School and education seem to have lost their function and meaning, as the crisis has threatened its core goals. It is thus, our conclusion, that, perhaps, what is required is for a critical pedagogy that will invoke reflection, questioning and challenging the meanings and identities of the contemporary society and education.",304905464,,Dissertations & Theses," Owinyo, Salome NyamburaOwinyoNyamburaSalomeOwinyo, Salome Nyambura", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1069875501 , 32600651 , 66569 , C823539 , C823539", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304905464?accountid=14496," 0533 Secondary education , 0627 Criminology"," 0533 Secondary education , 0627 Criminology"," 0533 Secondary education , 0627 Criminology",," 0533 Secondary education , 0627 Criminology"," Secondary education , Criminology"," Social sciences , Education , Kenya , School violence , Vandalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Caught+in-between%3A++Exploring+the+complexities+of+school+vandalism.+Case+study+research+in+Kenya&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Owinyo%2C+Salome+Nyambura&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Constructing Chinese Christian identity in diaspora during the 1950s and 1960s: A case study of Xie Fuya (1892–1991),"Xie Fuya (1892-1991), one of the most prolific Chinese theologians of the 20 th century, has so far been largely ignored in the historical or theological studies of Chinese Christianity. Even worse, Xie Fuya has been seriously misunderstood by some historians of Chinese Christianity. Some of them labeled him as a representative of the indigenous theologians who focused exclusively on the relation between Christianity and Chinese culture without any concern for the relevance of the Christian message to the contemporary social change. Some stereotyped him as one of the Chinese Christians who made a far-fetched comparison between Chinese culture and Christianity. However, these prevailing paradigmatic ""conclusions"" on Xie Fuya are not properly based on in-depth historical investigation and the derived theological criticisms were merely built on some a-historical assumptions. The present research aims at pointing out that the relevant historical materials do not support the above conclusions-that Xie Fuya did not concern the social and political situation of his homeland and indwelling place(s). In fact, historical evidences show that Xie as an indigenous theologian, not only spent time on bridging the relation between Christian message and Chinese culture, but also paid much effort in social construction and political participation. All these were done both before and after 1949. Furthermore, the present research is going to indicate that many historians and theologians have failed to take serious the diasporic context when articulating their concepts of traditional Chinese culture and of the Chinese identity. In fact, Xie Fuya, as a diasporic Chinese after 1949, did not define his Chinese identity and the Chinese culture in territorial or political terms. Instead, he shared the viewpoints of those overseas Chinese who were struggling to survive in diasporic contexts. And his diasporic experience and horizon generated a critical understanding of Chinese culture and indigenous theology as well as their relationship. Even now, some scholars in Mainland China continue to emphasize that indigenous theology should be understood, discussed and applied within the social, political and cultural contexts of Mainland China only. However, their understandings of Chinese culture and Chinese identity, as well as the related methodology of indigenous theology they have employed, need to be examined critically. The present thesis aims at investigating how the Chinese Christian intellectual Xie Fuya, responded to a diasporic movement resulting from the drastic political change of China in and after 1949. He tried to construct a unique and new identity that he had never had before-an identity that helped him to face the diasporic environment and generated a new horizon of his understanding of his faith. Showing the contents of this identity; the thesis illustrates how unique Xie's diasporic identity was expressed in the community of Chinese intellectuals and Chinese Christians during the 1950s and 1960s. That identity could not have been created, experienced and articulated by any Chinese and Christians inside Mainland China at that time. The thesis will argue that it is Xie Fuya's experience of being forced to leave his homeland and the reflection of his Christian thought and experience that helped formulate his diasporic identity. Furthermore, both the fate of Chinese overseas in different areas because of the change of international politics, and the understanding of his own ethnicity and culture through the discourse among the Chinese intellectuals in Hong Kong, helped reinforce the articulation of that dislocating identity. In addition, the thesis will argue that this diasporic identity constitutes a significant ingredient of Xie Fuya's indigenous theology and contributes to Xie's new understanding of his own indigenous theology of Christianity in a post-1949 diasporic environment. Xie's indigenous theology, especially his theological method, aroused furious discussion among Chinese Christian intellectuals in and after the 1960s. Such discourse was identified as a significant break of historical continuity between the past generation and the next of Chinese Christian intellectuals in Hong Kong. The significance of this research does not only rest in its showing that a significant and important figure like Xie Fuya has been neglected in the historical and theological studies of Chinese Christianity in the past; it is significant also because it discloses how the thought behind the identities of a diasporic Chinese and Chinese Christian bears significance in a historical context and contributes to a new understanding of the Chinese identity, the Chinese culture and indigenous theology from a different perspective---which is different from the past and is closely related to cultural, anthropological and theological studies of our times.",304908091,,Dissertations & Theses," Ho, Hing CheongHoCheongHingHo, Hing Cheong", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1288648121 , 35498501 , 66569 , 3254519 , 3254519", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304908091?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0332 History",," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0332 History"," Religious history , Religious congregations , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Chinese , Christian , Diaspora , Nineteen 50s , Nineteen 60s , Xie Fuya",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+Chinese+Christian+identity+in+diaspora+during%0Athe+1950s+and+1960s%3A+A+case+study+of+Xie+Fuya+%281892%E2%80%931991%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ho%2C+Hing+Cheong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The rise of Islamism among the sedentary Fulbe of northern Cameroon: Implications for theological responses,"This research examines the root causes of Islamism among the sedentary Fulbe of Northern Cameroon. The study attempts to draw the implications for the development of contextual theological responses to Islamism. The author begins with issues pertaining to the related theoretical framework and methodology. The most notable model for the study of Islamism seems to be the Dekmejian/Voll/Woodberry theory. Islamism is a worldwide phenomenon. Almost all African Islamist movements and organizations have networks with people or organizations in Asia and other continents. The study of Islamism in Cameroon does not ignore the global context. Since the focus is on the Fulbe ethnic group, the study examines their culture and worldview in order to better understand the impact of Islamism. Pulaaku is at the center of Fulbe culture and worldview and it has three key aspects: wisdom, patience, and reserve. Interestingly enough, cattle are also essential to the Fulbe worldview. However, if the nomadic Fulbe place the highest value on their cattle, the sedentary Fulbe culture revolves around Islam. Islamism, as it manifests itself in northern Cameroon, has been established through various means and a diverse team of change agents. As a result, key aspects of Fulbe culture and worldview have been impacted. The causes of the rise of Islamism are multidimensional and in accordance with the Dekmejian/Voll/Woodberry theory. Islamism is growing in Cameroon. This phenomenon, at least at a theoretical level, requires contextual theological responses that address the root causes of Islamism and meet the felt needs of the population in the light of the Holy Scriptures. In the final part of the study, the author draws implications and makes recommendations that may help to move from theory to practice. In the current world where Islamism is one of the major social and religious influences, this study presents principles that are of interest to theologians and non-theologians worldwide.",304913408,,Dissertations & Theses," Bongoyok, MoussaBongoyokMoussaBongoyok, Moussa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1276393911 , 34935861 , 66569 , 3252068 , 3252068", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304913408?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0469 Theology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0469 Theology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0469 Theology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0469 Theology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Cameroon , Fulbe , Islamism , Sedentary , Theological responses",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+rise+of+Islamism+among+the+sedentary+Fulbe+of+northern+Cameroon%3A+Implications+for+theological+responses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bongoyok%2C+Moussa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Deconstructing a South African narrative of oppression. The influence of religion in public policy: Christianity in South Africa, 1948–2004; exploring the African narrative of ubuntu","In 1948, the Afrikaner Nationalist Government became the ruling party in South Africa and instituted the brutal system known as apartheid. To maintain their power, Afrikaners drew on Christian scripture and traditions to create self-justifying religious narratives that supported their oppressive ideologies, prohibiting inclusion and suppressing pluralism. Concepts of manifest destiny and redemptive violence supported a divisive culture of suppression of the majority by the minority. The Afrikaner-Christian narratives that provided the underpinnings for apartheid began to unravel as counter-narratives within the Christian tradition in Latin America (liberation theology) and Asia ( minjung theology) and African theologies influenced the Black church to demand equality and democracy. The South African historical, political, social, economic, cultural, and theological context is best understood and interpreted through the vision of ubuntu philosophy, theology, and thought. One of the most powerful concepts which, demonstrates the high value that African cultures place on humanity and expresses this solidarity in a corporate communal way of life that demonstrates the powerful shift from singularity to plurality in South African society. The dismantling of apartheid led to recognition of the religious other, the recovery of the alternate narratives and the reappearance of ubuntu perspective and practice in the political and public sphere. After the peaceful transition to a democratically elected government, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission drew on the narrative openings created by the struggle against apartheid, and by global anti-colonial theological movement, to create a platform for multiple voices, stories, and religious narratives to be shared in a public political context. This multiplicity of voices resulted, ultimately, in the formation of a new constitution for South Africa that seeks to uphold African values of community and inclusion in its institutions. While South Africa's apartheid system and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are both rooted in the biblical narrative, the former used its theology to enforce and iron rule, while the latter combined Christian and African concepts to create a pluralistic and open society expressive of a culture that places emphasis on communality and interdependence of each individual's humanity solidifying ubuntu, a person is a person through other persons.",304944270,,Dissertations & Theses," Paul, Samuel A.PaulA.SamuelPaul, Samuel A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1105000341 , 33063171 , 66569 , 9780542562976 , 0542562979 , 3207159 , 3207159", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542562976 , 0542562979", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304944270?accountid=14496," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology , 0331 African history"," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology , 0331 African history"," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology , 0331 African history",," 0321 Bible , 0469 Theology , 0331 African history"," Bible , Theology , African history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christianity , Deconstructing , Narrative , Oppression , Public policy , South Africa , Ubuntu",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Deconstructing+a+South+African+narrative+of+oppression.+The%0Ainfluence+of+religion+in+public+policy%3A+Christianity+in+South+Africa%2C+1948%E2%80%932004%3B+exploring+the+African+narrative+of+ubuntu&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paul%2C+Samuel+A.&amp;isbn=9780542562976&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Concurrent conservation and development: Lessons learned from a community-based case in Thailand,"Community-based management holds the potential to simultaneously deal with the multiple objectives of community economic development and the conservation of natural resources. Pred Nai Community Forestry Group based in the coastal mangrove forests of Thailand was recognized by the UNDP in 2004 as an example of a successful case of community-based management. The overall purpose of this research was to study the Pred Nai group in order to learn about the institutional and organizational characteristics, and the cross-scale linkages that facilitate community-based management. This qualitative research was carried out during four months of fieldwork in rural Thailand using interviews and participant observation. Pred Nai Community Forestry Group has been working toward the sustainable use and restoration of the local mangrove forest. The principal means they have employed includes the restoration of formerly logged and degraded areas and the development of a forest management plan. In addition to stopping the loss of existing biodiversity, their efforts have also resulted in the return of many formerly displaced native fauna, including species of wetland birds and monkeys. Pred Nai's conservation efforts have also had a direct impact on alleviating poverty and facilitating local economic development. This has come about through the improvement of yields in the local crab harvest, the utilization of non-timber forest products from the mangroves, and the establishment of a village savings fund to assist with social and economic development initiatives. The restoration and conservation of mangrove forests has improved the long-term sustainability of the villagers' economic activities. Research on Pred Nai's community-based management program revealed the importance of the following factors: (1) Availability of funding to proceed in small, practical steps; (2) A village savings group that provides capital, training, and lends credibility to the community; (3) Step-wise evolution leading to formal management; (4) Step-wise evolution allowing for capacity building over time; (5) Interplay of leadership, community cohesion and NGO support; (6) Leadership as key to grassroots movement; (7) Partnership with a key organization for building capacity and establishing linkages, in this case, RECOFTC; (8) Horizontal learning among communities as the key to replication of experience, and; (9) Local ecological knowledge as the foundation for environmental stewardship. The community did not immediately assume full responsibility for the management of the mangroves, but instead progressively assumed a greater role over time as the community built capacity and gained experience. Strong leadership within the community also played an important role as it ensured that the community members remained united in support of Pred Nai's conservation and management efforts. It was found that Pred Nai has formed numerous important linkages with external organizations, i.e. government, NGOs, and other communities, at the sub-district, provincial, national and international levels. Networking and other forms of horizontal learning between communities also played an important role in the replication of Pred Nai's successful initiative in other communities. Local ecological knowledge also played a role in Pred Nai's success as the community members' knowledge of the mangrove forest allowed them to create rules which were relevant to local ecological conditions, thereby helping the community to conserve a resource that provides at least part of the livelihood needs for 80% of Pred Nai villagers.",304953708,,Dissertations & Theses," Senyk, Jason Peter JohnSenykPeter JohnJasonSenyk, Jason Peter John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1317313961 , 33063641 , 66569 , 9780494261873 , MR26187 , MR26187", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494261873, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304953708?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Concurrent+conservation+and+development%3A++Lessons+learned+from+a+community-based+case+in+Thailand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Senyk%2C+Jason+Peter+John&amp;isbn=9780494261873&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Imagining and performing Habasha identity: The Ethiopian diaspora in the area of Washington, D.C.","Washington, D.C. hosts a distinct density of Ethiopians that sets it apart as the largest Ethiopian demographic axis and cultural hub outside of the horn of African country. Unfamiliar with the historical white-black relations in the United States (partially attributable to absence of colonial occupation), Ethiopians migrated to the United States in three waves beginning from the 1920s. These movements reflected the turbulent political and economic traumas their homeland experienced in the 20 th -century in concert with global forces that transformed the world. The qualitative majority of Ethiopian immigrants in the United States are speakers of the Afro-Semitic languages, Amharic and Tigrigna, to whom blackness represents an alien notion of inferiority. This dissertation examines Ethiopians' reinvention and performance of the racially ambivalent Habasha identity in Washington, D.C. as a creative response to the disempowering implications of blackness. It addresses Habasha's entanglement in the political economic hierarchies of America by focusing on how everyday and symbolic performances enable or disable Ethiopians' desire to fit into the molds of dominant American discourses of race, ethnicity, gender, and class. The Habasha seek to establish their prestige through ritualized re-enactments of Judeo-Christian heritage and phenotypic markers that they stage in different spaces such as churches, restaurants, coffee shops, stadiums, fashion catwalks, museums, and so forth. Conversely, African-Americans and southern Ethiopians contest expressions of Habasha exceptionalism. These processes unfold against a backdrop of rapid gentrification in the Adams Morgan and Shaw neighborhoods of northwestern Washington, D.C., the retail hearts of Habasha mobility and areas Ethiopians have made home since the 1980s. Although the general rise in real estate prices continues to affect both communities, a recent proposal to rename a corner of 9 th Street at U Street, NW to ""Little Ethiopia"" has particularly intensified tensions between Ethiopians and African-Americans. The dissertation argues that Habashaness highlights ""Semitic"" ancestry to circumvent the negative ascriptions of blackness in exchange for economic and social mobility. Yet, it also emphasizes the contested performances of Habashaness can be sites for racial/ethnic dialogue in order to tackle larger socio-economic disparities.",305292877,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohammed, Mohammed HamidMohammedHamidMohammedMohammed, Mohammed Hamid", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1126775611 , 33439021 , 66569 , 9780542621512 , 0542621517 , 3212812 , 3212812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542621512 , 0542621517", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305292877?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American studies , Cultural anthropology , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Diaspora , Ethiopian , Habasha , Identity , Washington, D.C.",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+and+performing+Habasha+identity%3A+The+Ethiopian+diaspora+in+the+area+of+Washington%2C+D.C.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohammed%2C+Mohammed+Hamid&amp;isbn=9780542621512&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Hospitality: Resolving gross inequalities of welfare and cultivating civic virtue,"Hospitality is a social practice little examined in either its personal or policy implications. One notable exception is Immanuel Kant's work in Perpetual Peace where he describes hospitality as a large scale interaction between nations and foreign guests. In this dissertation, I expand on Kant's initial description of large scale hospitality. I draw on his political and moral work to construct a more robust, Kantian version of hospitality that provides a theoretical justification for all hospitality relationships whether they are large or small. I argue that hospitality has significant implications for the way in which we address deep inequalities of welfare. On my account of hospitality, I claim that the host has three central tasks: (1) to allow visitation and access to needed material resources; (2) to build relationships of respect with the guest; and (3) to display a basic level of concern for the guest's well being. When we offer hospitality to both foreigners and fellow citizens, we provide them with essential material resources (such as food and shelter), emotional support (through our welcome and care of them), as well as access to important life opportunities (such as education or medical treatment). When people have access to these material and immaterial resources, they achieve an equality of welfare with others, a fundamental right that allows them to fulfill important life plans. In addition, I argue that hospitality helps citizens develop civic virtues. Kant argues that citizens must act on the common good to create strong national governments and international associations, but he doesn't explain how citizens are to develop the necessary virtues that enable them to do this. I examine Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker Movement as examples of small scale hospitality offered to the least among society. I argue that when we act as hosts in the hospitality relationship, we expand our vision to include the needs of those who suffer from inequalities and learn how to act for the common good. Thus, practicing hospitality cultivates civic virtues necessary to achieve the broader aims of Kant's vision.",305314575,,Dissertations & Theses," Janzen, Monica GreenwellJanzenGreenwellMonicaJanzen, Monica Greenwell", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251845391 , 34301161 , 66569 , 9780542951671 , 3240477 , 3240477", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542951671, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305314575?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," Philosophy, religion and theology , Civic virtue , Hospitality , Inequalities , Kant, Immanuel , Welfare",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hospitality%3A+Resolving+gross+inequalities+of+welfare+and+cultivating+civic+virtue&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Janzen%2C+Monica+Greenwell&amp;isbn=9780542951671&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Race, housing, and the making of twentieth-century Louisville, Kentucky","Using oral histories, census data, newspapers, letters, diaries, and municipal records, this dissertation analyzes the creation of the predominately African American West End of Louisville, Kentucky, during the twentieth century. Praised for its racial progress by national and international observers, including Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson, Louisville had a long history of racial inequality and economic oppression. At the beginning of the twentieth century, African Americans and whites lived next to each other in the city's downtown business district. Over the course of sixty years, individual forms of discrimination merged with institutional discrimination as government officials and business leaders, homeowners and real estate agents, and moneylenders and mortgage brokers in Louisville deliberately kept African Americans out of white neighborhoods and isolated from economic opportunities. By the end of the twentieth century, a residential color line starkly divided Louisville with African Americans living in the West End, which was situated on a flood plain and in the path of air pollution from nearby industries, and whites living everywhere else. This study of Louisville positions housing at the center of the movement for racial equality and economic justice. In so doing, it illustrates the complex relationship between housing and racial and class categories. Working-class whites joined with middle-class and upper-class whites to protect their neighborhoods from African American residents because housing symbolized economic mobility, social standing, and financial vitality. Examining the struggle over where African Americans should live in Louisville, this dissertation illustrates the limitations of public policy to eradicate private prejudice and structural racism. Despite the passage of federal and local legislation against discrimination, African Americans continued to be relegated to the West End of the city. In the end, Louisville remained one of the nation's most segregated cities at the end of the twentieth century. Keywords.

My thesis breaks new ground in that it attempts to place the story of Tunisian veterans in the wider global context of the World Wars and decolonization. Earlier studies of Tunisian veterans, while comprehensive in some aspects, limit their inquiry to a specifically Tunisian context. My research into recently-released French archives documenting Tunisian veterans in the 1950s also contributes to the importance of my thesis. Whereas most Tunisian historians have considered the veterans as ""collaborators"" with the French, my research indicates that such generalizations simply do not describe the complex relationship between the veterans and French colonial rule. Rather, I argue that veterans participated in and, in some cases, seem to have organized armed resistance to French rule. In contrast to similar research on African veterans from French Equatorial Africa (AOF), my research on North African veterans reveals that the political roles open to Tunisian veterans in the post-independence period were few and far between, unlike the situation in the Ivory Coast or Mali. Finally, my limited interviews with Tunisian veterans and my use of interviews transcribed by other Tunisian scholars provide unique insights as to how veterans themselves interpreted the wartime and post-war environment. The introduction functions as an historiographical overview positioning Tunisian veterans within the wider context of veterans' movements in France, North Africa, and elsewhere. Specifically, I pose the question of why Tunisian veterans did not become politicized as did other Arab veterans (notably in Iraq and Morocco). The first chapter deals with the establishment of the French Protectorate in Tunisia and the First World War. I explore the depth of pan-Islamic and pro-Ottoman sympathies among the troops, as well as the experience of Tunisian troops in German prisoner-of-war camps. The second chapter deals with the aftermath of the First World War and the halting efforts to define social benefits for the veterans. The veterans and their descendants use their correspondence with the French administration to negotiate benefits on the basis of their wartime sacrifices. The third chapter deals with the Second World War and the enormous upheaval of the French defeat in 1940. I use an appeal by Marshal Pétain and a Free French Franco-Arabic military journal Al-Nasr , published from 1943-1946, to detail the intense French propaganda efforts to retain the loyalty of Muslim soldiers. The fourth chapter details belated French efforts to reinvigorate their policies towards the veterans, while exploring the increased militancy of some veterans as French power waned in the late 1950s. The fifth chapter deals with the post-independence period (1956-Present) and describes how Tunisian veterans were pushed to the margins of historical memory (both in France and in Tunisia). The chapter ends with a discussion of how and why the veterans have once again emerged as a potent symbol for national unity and pride in both France and Tunisia in recent years.",305338363,,Dissertations & Theses," DeGeorges, Thomas PatrickDeGeorgesPatrickThomasDeGeorges, Thomas Patrick", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1158516551 , 34018301 , 66569 , 9780542692284 , 3217711 , 3217711", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542692284, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305338363?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history"," Middle Eastern history , European history"," Social sciences , Colonialism , France , Tunisian , Veterans , World War I , World War II",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+bitter+homecoming%3A+Tunisian+veterans+of+the+first+and+second+world+wars&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DeGeorges%2C+Thomas+Patrick&amp;isbn=9780542692284&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The decorative fire of Susan S. Frackelton: China painting, art pottery, and book illumination","Susan Stuart Goodrich Frackelton (1848-1932) was an influential leader in American ceramic art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She personified the emergence of the professional woman artist and entrepreneur. Her work spanned both the Aesthetic and the Arts and Crafts Movements. Although she was a regional artist, based in the emerging and largely immigrant city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, she received many awards for her china painting and art pottery at national and international exhibitions. Her experiments in native clays, salt-glaze stoneware, and porcelain garnered her much acclaim for originality. That originality extended to her collaborations with George E. Ohr. Her ceramic oeuvre expressed an interest in nature as inspiration for art and the many debates between naturalism and conventionalism surrounding the depiction of design. Her sketches and watercolors reflect the art training she received from landscape painter Heinrich Vianden. As a successful businesswoman, author, inventor, teacher, and lecturer, she shaped a career that went beyond the decorating and making of ceramic objects. Her many accomplishments, including her manual, Tried by Fire: A Work on China-Painting , invention of a portable gas kiln for firing china, and the manufacture of mineral colors, directly supported the engagement of women in ceramic arts. With a goal to elevate American ceramic art, she co-founded the National League of Mineral Painters in 1892, which enabled thousands of amateur artists, most of whom were women, to have a visible profile on the exhibition scene. Her contributions to the art of book illumination, some of which were collaborations with her daughter and the Monastery Hill Bindery, and done for the Chicago Woman's Club as well as for private individuals such as Elizabeth A. Plankinton and Henry N. Torrey, crowned her achievements in the decorative arts. Frackelton's work and career provides a multi-faceted understanding of the social, educational, and artistic framework that supported the development of American ceramic art and decorative arts in general, and sheds light on the struggle of women to gain recognition as artists.",305348528,,Dissertations & Theses," Korenic, Lynette MarieKorenicMarieLynetteKorenic, Lynette Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1196405111 , 33455721 , 66569 , 9780542794896 , 3226267 , 3226267", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542794896, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305348528?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0304 Biographies"," 0377 Art history , 0304 Biographies"," 0377 Art history , 0304 Biographies",," 0377 Art history , 0304 Biographies"," Art history , Biographies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Art pottery , Book illumination , China painting , Frackelton, Susan Stuart Goodrich , George E.

As the core the of the development change the Chinese society in the Qing dynasty , the city is the intuitionistic windows the that sees the through a the Chinese society the of the Qing dynasty to change. there is very the strong academic the worth and the realistic meaning in the city the history research of the Qing dynasty. However, the research in the southwest frontier in Qing dynasty, than that of coast and river's region have very big bad situation. Concreting go to ground Guangxi in the southwest frontier race region, although the Guangxi city history in the Qing dynasty research has already presented the better development, but carries on the macroscopic research of whole to the city development in Guangxi history conduct and actions present a few blank appearances, want to have a right way along in advance the footprint long steps of expand innovation, it is the demand that strengthens an academic research, is also the ages background that the service starts in ""free trade area in China-ASEAN"" in current Guangxi under, push forward ages of the modernization construction in the side frontier that changes in to lead first by town to need strongly. According to the above-mentioned understanding, this text with city development for correspond a point, according to the globalization progress pushes a Chinese social slow-moving transformation of great ages background from the 17th to 20th century, as Guangxi city in the Qing dynasty a whole, with city modernization development and social change for the stalk line, asking for help a modernization and society association theories etc. the across an the academics the of the theories the method by the many the visual the fields the with the academic, the deep the into the a ground the of the reflection the Guangxi the city completely economy, society, the cultural the development in the Qing dynasty turn the into process and various the society change, the delineating and the announcing to the public Qing dynasty from the theories the Guangxi city development turn into of track, characteristic, regulation, providing the theories instruction nowadays for the modern construction of the race frontier. In the viewpoint of the author, city development in the frontier faces complicated natural geography environment and human geography environment. The complicated natural ecosystem , and the complicated race and dinglpopulation constitute, changeable self-contradict conflict, the fall behind the of the social economic the appearance combine together, the becoming various the resources advantages , and complicated the region difference the of settle of Guangxi the city development, the also corresponding the a ground the of composing the to settle the empress, the motion and the unbalance that the a Guangxi the city develop, causing the Guangxi city in the Qing dynasty development total present the horizontal stairs ,level difference up with lengthways the undulate stage. From the Qing Dynasty unifies Guangxi, the government begins to promote a series of aggressive frontier policies ,such as, the changing the soil to the return to flow, the immigrating and empoldering frontier, initiateing water conservancy in Guangxi, the reforming the salt method, the developping business, the mining, the handicraft industry, building the road, developping a culture and education etc. By this chance, the another province business economy emigrant flows out in great quantities into city country region in Guangxi, promoting the economic development of city in Guangxi progress with culture. In the late Qing dynasty, with the opening of longzhou, the Wuzhou, Nanning seaports, the foreign the capitalism economy, the cultural the influence deeply the main city the in Guangxi, the reforming political and the reform in the late of Qing dynasty push a the laurel Guilin, Wuzhou, Nanning the center city function enhanced further, the local area city administration system and economic network system evolved continuously, cities in Guangxi presented a development of many levels a change distinguish the evolution. In the text , the author will explore the city of the society , cultural, economy. In the city economy, Guangxi is the region lagging development in the Qing dynasty, its huge resources value drew on the large quantity another province businessman to immigrate, the strong economy radialization that the from the province, moved city business economy and handicraft industry an economic prosperity development in Guangxi. On the other hand, the city opening push directly outward economic associate of city in Guangxi from the tradition the trade changes toward the modern country international trade. With dynamical modern international trade basing on capitalism industrial productivity, Guangxi city drew in a world to produce division of labour system in the capitalism industrial civilization of dissemination, push city economy up the earlier period modernization of development road in Guangxi. From now on the movement of the city economy in Guangxi also follows to be subjected to the modern ear. The economy circulating influenced deeply was official organization, civil association and the outside ocean together. In the city society, the social management style took place a deep change under the impact of the outside impact, management gradually turn from the traditional city toward modern city, the folk society in the city the safe the management is further convex in the Qing dynasty Guangxi .The city society organizatian from ex-modern period category one, self-moving and lax to diversified direction of development, city society integration the degree deepen continuously. Under the impact of the western the capitalism civilization, the city social the activities in the Guangxi city begin the west vulgar the history progress, however, because the social the productivity the arrearage of change , the modern the age turn of the living principle and life the style haven't the yet can the break up the traditional the living idea and life style completely, some traditional factors still be influencing the city residents' daily life. In the city culture, under the western impact, the Guangxi city educational principle, managed a system and various aspect of the type and content modernized. various consciousness, such as nation state ,reform, democracy revolution. etc in the Qing dynasty from have no to have, from weak arrive strong gradually .At the same time, the culture ,by the West River's waterway, the Xiang-Guil hallway. much toward to extend a dissemination in the city in Guangxi ,appear prospects West-chinese introjecting in city in Guangxi. The development of the city effected greatly to society of Guangxi city in the southwest race region , Firstly, as the economic the function strengthens the continuously of the city for base, the businessman the expand the business trade the activity toward the peripheral country, the commercial management network extended to the town in the city suburb immediately, the commercial the motive that the comes from the city also the delivers to the peripheral town in the country region's turning progress can quicker propulsion; the predial economic structure as well marketabilited in the ethical region. Secondly, the developing Guangxi cities played an important function in resisting France to invade in the pure government, keeping the stabilization of the southwest frontier. But the frontier defense construction promoted to settle a Guangxi city to develop further after the China—France war.The special natural environment and the humanities environment maked the Guangxi city development of the Qing dynasty present to follow a river an alignment again, to flourish for water .The big city tripartited confrontation, the first center city lacking. The foreign businessmen's funtion is far larger than native businessman in driving the city development in Guangxi. To it, the author contrast Yunnan city development in the southwest frontier . As important city of the southwest frontier, the development of Guangxi city experienced from the tradition to the modern in the Qing dynasty. In it transformation, it isn't difficult to discovers the current characteristic in Chinese city, and then display the strong individuality of the city in the frontier. Firstly, the Guangxi city development lay foundation stone a bottom of a series of politics, economy, culture exploitation predominating by the central government and the local government in the Qing dynasty. Every development high tide accompanied with the stage development of the city, showing an inside development of the Guangxi city of the Qing dynasty, and depended the national strength push seriously. Secondly, (businessman as predominant) transplant is the primary way of the development activities in the Qing dynasty. A large quantity another province businessmen settle into Guangxi city, not only promoting the Guangxi city the economy development, but also bringing into multiplex culture in Guangxi cities. pushing the transform of economy and society of Guangxi cities in the Qing dynasty. Because of the affinal culture, isomorphic geography, reciprocal economy between Guangdong and Guangxi. Thirdly, the foreign economic and culture's aggression the influence with the Guangxi open the port, the going the deep the into the interior the region in Guangxi, city in the Guangxi then the drowns completely to differ the system for the western the capitalism economic and cultural class in the most the low level, transmuting into a western capital nation to loot original material and dump its industrial product of in turn a station.The development of the city in the Guangxi economy, the such as, Longzhou,Wuzhou,Nanning,Guilin,Liuzhou ,relyed on mostly the import of the west nations, the adapting western the capitalism native the agriculture the vice-soil the special product gathers to spread, process for the motive. In this kind of unprecedentedly the prosperity, the high abnormal not on an equal footingly the foreign trade, the production technique and economic management system of the western some forer unnerseses is transplant by cities in Guangxi immediately,and the economic structure modernlized. Western nation at the time of carrying on economic depredation to city in Guangxi, also to enlargement the culture invade. The Western science culture, the thought, the idea, the life style the streamed into the city in the Guangxi gradually, the urging city culture, the society to the take place a deep change. However, the exploitation of the Guangxi in the Qing dynasty is turmoil measure after the emergency ,and dealing with problems arising from an accident. the policy was lack of the political enthusiasm and strong dint guarantee, develop strength and develop an actual achievement was weaken greatly with check and supervision. On the other hand, the businessmen's movement of the region difference, the merchant capital outflowing, Under the yoke of world need of the abnormal economy trade， capitalism market completely the substance full general the native city economic resources transferred to the west nation, plus turbulence of social milieu, the all these causes to settle a Guangxi city to develop directly of meet delay to be out of balance. In a word, the development of Guangxi city in Qing dynasty, seeing from the motivity and mode, it is adhering development road; in tendency seen result and process, presenting to meet delay and unbalance; The total characteristic can generalize highly for adhering a development and meeting delay and unbalance. The development process of the Guangxi city in Qing dynasty express, development of the city in frontier faced the more special natural geography and the humanities environment. There were edge, nationality and openning, complexity, unbalance characteristics. The mainly momentum development come from the outside not inside. The outside momentum is the first . That make the development of the city in the frontier rely on outward factor heavily, but the city in the frontier development had great significance to the development of the frontier ,the whole national economy society. Know to all, the history of frontier city is the research topic that has a bigger sensitive degree and has to compare greatly applied value. At present, around the city development theories of the study is placed in a beginning stage still, research in the theories method needs a further investigation more. Using for reference from foreign same kind theories ,we should pay attention to its precondition in stuy of city history.

Opencast mines of China were mainly suited in ecological fragile zone in arid and semiarid region. Mining resulted in deterioration of ecological conditions. Land use and cover derived by mining showed different regional change between city and countryside, which witnessed land wasted, vegetation bankrupted and ecosystem lost its self-supported capability, and revealed notable impact on sustainable development of mine region. A case study was done on the first modern large opencast mine, Antaibao Opencast Mine. Based on analysis of land reclamation and ecological restoration in mining area, a theoretical framework of mining area ecosystem and its controlling ecosystem were established, and controlling technology systems was furthermore put forward. Geographic Information Systems was used as the platform to analyze land use/cover change and establish primary integrated land use/cover change model, which was then used to analyze drive factor and relevant land, environmental and human activity problem. There are few report about change rule and drive power of land use in mine region. As such, the paper conducted a beneficial try and the main results were list as following: (1) Considering characteristics of land use in large opencast mining area, land use change process was divided as two phase. The first phase is land use change in ecological damange, including land xcavating, occupying and piling. The second phase is land use change in ecological restoration, that is, reconstruction of landforms, soil, and vegetation. Land use/cover showed spatial quick movement, changeability of land factor, polyphase of land sustainability, complexity of land types. The analysis result of Antaibao Opencast Mining Area land use change showed that all land use/cover changed except expropriated area in Mining Area Ecosystem. Damaged area of mining is 2003.07 hm2. Forestry land showed biggest change, which increased with 492.52hm2 of area. Shrub land added 329.02hm2 with 46.52% increasing rate per year. 329.4hm2 of industrial land was added, which are mainly industrial building, facility filed and factory land. Industrial land is supposed not to have much change in the next period. Mining land was added with 406.17hm2 of area. Bare land added 413.38hm2, which are most land waiting for restored. (3) Water erosion assessment index and model was used to analyze water-land safety grade of dump in land reclamation phase and later restored phase, which showed high risk and low safety grade separately. (4) The drive power of land use change was discussed based on land use change characteristics. The land use change phases in mining area were firstly divided with the dominated drive power as basic criterion. Land use change in mining area was consumed to be the integrated result of internal and external drive power. Currently the land in mining area could not realize optimal benefit. However, the main reason is not restoration technology but management systems problem. As such, government should take on duty to guarantee social public benefit, and take economical measures and management means to support the land restoration.

And it has also brought on to the table the issue whether ethical consideration and value judgment should be implanted in the economics research. Therefore, business ethics has become a critical topic both in academic and practice field.From historical perspective, economics originated as an offshoot of Moral Philosophy. But the study on economics theory evolution shows that this origin has diverged into two different paths during the development. On the one side, economics has been viewed as a purely positive science, thus ethical theme has been downplayed because of the principle of value-neutral. On the other side, economics has been viewed as a social science with the nature of science and humanity, and economics research has been regarded as a field that embraces both ethics and value judgment. Thus, it conveys strong alliance between economics and ethics.At the same time, business practice has been calling for rebuilding the ethical dimension in economics research and business practice. Therefore, coming from different disciplines, business ethics has developed into an independent science since 1970s. Also, since 1990s, an extensive global business practice has resulted from the integration of theory and practice. Enterprises are at the core of the ethics practice movement. This movement has been driven by the governments, NGOs, enterprises and individuals etc. in the ways of laws, initiatives, authentications and principles or codes of conduct etc.Combining the results of many years’ researches in China and one-year as visiting scholar in the U.S., this paper concentrates on the theory and practice issues of business ethics. It reviews the ethics theories of major economics schools and of their representative economists historically, and it explores the development of modern business ethics as an independent discipline. Therefore, this paper provides a historical picture on the theoretical origin and the evolution of business ethics in both China and Western society. Also, it concludes the similarities and compares the differences between business ethics theories of China and of the Western society. The research then reaches a conclusion that the ethical and moral consideration will enable more profound and more persuasive economics research both in China and abroad, both in the past and present, even though great differences in politics, economy and culture do exist. Meanwhile, even though approaches of practices are diversified, the results from the research on the business ethics in enterprises practices have shown that ethics management has become a critical part in corporate management globally, and is helpful for constructing a more ethical business community. Based on the theoretical and practical analysis, this paper finally suggests the rapid theory and practice development of business ethics in China, which is definitely urgent and important for building a harmonious society. In order to do so, a comprehensive integration should be emphasized, by considering Chinese background of special development phase and traditional business ethics, by following Marxism scientific methodology, and by learning from the experience of European and American.  ",1027903506, 经济伦理：理论演进与实践考察,Dissertations & Theses," Zheng, Juan RuoZhengRuoJuanZheng, Juan Ruo郑若娟", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721168451 , 70534122 , 189128 , H242261 , H242261", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, Chinese, Chinese, 经济伦理：理论演进与实践考察,2007,PQDT - Global,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027903506?accountid=14496, 0509 Economic history, 0509 Economic history, 0509 Economic history,, 0509 Economic history, Economic history," (UMI)AAIH242261 , Social sciences , Business Ethics , Economics Schools , Ethics Management , Theory Evolution , 伦理管理 , 理论演进 , 经济伦理 , 经济思想史",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Business+Ethics%3A+Theoretical+Evolution+and+Business+Practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zheng%2C+Juan+Ruo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Industrial Evolution Theory,"The Industrial Evolution Theory Major：political economics Doctorate candidate：Chen Xiaotao Tutor：Jiang Yongmu The industry evolution is the unceasing change process of the industrial structure and content in the developing process，and is the industrial unceasingly self- renewal process，which enhances the economical scale and the aggregate in the quantity，and enhances the economic efficiency and the character in the quality，which performs the industrial structure unceasing rationalization and the advancement process in the time evolution，and which refers to its spatial crosswise expansion，including industrial overall scale unceasing expansion，industrial regional distribution expansion，industrial layout optimization and industrial shift in the spatial structure evolution. The industry evolution is the process that the resources disposition structure transforms，and is integration of the continuity and the non- continuity. The industrialization essence is the industrial evolution process，which not only is the industrial structure from the primary agriculture to the primary industry，but also is the industry internal structure evolution process，with the unceasing elimination of the decline industry，the strength of the technological reformation to traditional industry，the reasonable transformation to the leading industry and the support and the guidance to the emerging industry. The economic development experience among various countries indicated that the industrial evolution had the obvious regularity with the national income level enhancement and the economical development，but regarding different country and area，the industrial evolution presented own obvious particularity because of the differences of the respective resources constitution，the social system，the traditional culture and the development successive aspect. The economical development practice and theory indicated that the industrial evolution and the economical development had the special relation，which the evolution on the level of the economic development and the altitude of the industrial structure was synchronized，and the industrial structure had become the important symbol that weigh a country development phase in society，economy and culture. Based on the deeper level，the economical development core is the industrial structure evolution and optimization. Industrial structure evolution speed reflects not only the industrialization speed，but also the modernization quality and level of production and life. Therefore，the elementary sentence of economic development is the industrial structure evolution，and the reasonable industrial structure has the significant function to the economic development. The economic structure evolution centralized by the industrial structure became the basic characteristic and the content of the modern economic growth and development，and the industrial structure change constituted the vivid connotation of the economic growth and development，so the strategy on the economic development was formulated on the basis of the rule of industrial structure evolution in various countries. Therefore，the research into industrial evolution mechanism and the exploration into industrial evolution rule, naturally had become the hot spot and key to the research region of the modern economy development，so the research into industrial structure evolution has the actual significance to our country economic development. Since the 20th century 70's，the self-organization fundamental research has thrived and become an emerging science, which creates the new method and scientific thought that enlighten the sociologist and the economist to explore the rule of the social movement and the economic movement. The self-organization theory mainly includes the dissipative structure theory, synergetics, morphogensis and so on. The external performance of the industrial system evolution process is namely the industry economic phenomena，and the openness, the non- balance and the non-linearity of the industrial system is the fountain from which the complexity and the multiplicity of industry economic phenomena derives. The organization evolution of the industrial system is the process with a circulating reciprocation and the structural unceasing evolution. The production and the development of self-organization theory, as well as its convergence with the national innovation system theory, the evolution economic theory and the growth economic theory, provides the new and broader field for the research into industrial evolution mechanism. At the same time, some analysis tools such as evolution economics，the evolution game theory，the experimental economics，the chaos theory and the non-linear dynamics and so on also unceasingly emerge in the evolution economic models, which causes the very good coordination between the complexity of the research objects and the analysis tools. Our country is a developing economic great nation with fundamental change, and the economic development and the adjustment of the economic structure has extremely close relationship. Since the reform and the open policy，along with the fast growth of national economy，our country industrial structure adjustment has obtained the remarkable achievement，by means of a series of policies and measures including the prior development of the light industry, the scale expansion of durable consumable import，the constructive strength of the foundation industry and the infrastructure, vigorous development of the tertiary industry and so on，to enable our country industrial structure gradually to tend to the coordination and to develop towards the optimized and promoted direction. Our country industrial structure change mainly presents the characteristics：①The industrialization advancement further speeds up，and the second industrial with steady growth constitutes the main content which our country economy grows；②The agricultural internal structure is reasonable day by day；③The growth between weight industry and light industry is reasonable day by day；④The tertiary industry develops rapidly；⑤The production resources are collected to the superior enterprises gradually. But China takes in a developing great nation，whose industrial structure adjustment has its distinction. China has dual economic structure between the city and countryside and between the industry and agriculture. In our country economic life，at present，the exposed prominent contradiction is the structure unbalance, the supply excess，the demand insufficient, the industrial optimization and promotion. Looked from the deeper level，the essence of the supply surplus is the supply structure and industrial structure in particular is unreasonable，which cannot adapt the change of market demand structure，whose essence is the backward industrial structure. At present，with the obvious globalization tendency of international economy and the intense international competition day by day，the melt of the chinese economy into in the global economy and the access into WTO will bring not only the development opportunity to China but also serious challenge to chinese economy. Under the economical globalization background，facing the adjustment upsurge of the world industrial structure，the primary mission of our country economic development will be the acceleration of the industrial structure optimization and promotion. The 16th Party's reports proposed that，“The industrialization realization still is the arduous historical duty in our country modernization advancement”，“With the persistence in the information impetus to industrialization and the industrialization promotion to information, we will go out a new industrialization pathway followed by the high technological content，the good economic efficiency, the low resources consumption, the low environmental pollution and the full display of the human resources superiority”, “we will advance industrial structure optimization and promotion to form the full scale pattern of industrial development”. Walking the new industrialization path is the inevitable choice which our country realizes the industrialization and modernization. As the biggest developing nation，under the economic globalization background，at present our country is a crucial time of the new industrialization advancement，therefore，we adjust the industrial structure to realize the industrial structure optimization and to enhance the industrial economic competition，which has specially vital significance to realize the new industrialization. This article will take the Marx economic theory as the instruction，simultaneously profit from the domestic and foreign industrial economics and the western economic theory, combine microscopic analysis with the macroscopic analysis，and integrate the standard research with the real diagnosis analysis，to lay emphasis on the research into the pattern，the influence factor and way of industrial evolution，and refer to the international experience，and use our country statistical data to review and analyze our country industrial structure change，and to explore the process and the rule of our country industrial evolution，and to research into the existent question of our country industrial structure，the compared superiority，the adjustment direction and the countermeasure. In the research，based on the self-organization theory and method and the evolution economic theory, through the establishment of non-linear dynamics mathematical model，with the aid of to the logistic equation，the mechanism and the process of the industrial self-organization evolution will be carried on the discussion. The paper structure and the main content are： 1st chapter, the present situation and achievement of the domestic and foreign research was introduced systemically，mainly involving the elementary theory of industrial evolution，including the Marxism industrial structure theory，the western industry evolution theory and our country scholar's research，and the current research situation and the newest progress of industrial evolution theory was fully analyzed，and the industrial evolution theory was summarized from the different research angle. 2nd chapter，the world industry evolution was briefly analyzed. The historical vicissitude of the global industry promotion was introduced，the current new tendency of the world industry evolution was summarized，and the enlightenment on the developed country experience to the chinese industry promotion was induced. 3rd chapter，The industrial evolution pattern was analyzed，the influence factors of the industrial evolution were induced，the industrial evolution way was discussed，the industrial evolution rule was summarized，and finally，the judgment standard and the safeguard system of the industrial evolution was discussed. 4th、5th chapters，the influence factor analysis of industrial evolution. Based on the macroscopic and microscopic economic agents such as the natural resource, the labor resources, the expense demand，the investment，the foreign trade，the system，the technology advancement， the flexible production，the industry concentration，the product difference， the entrance barrier，the labor division and so on，the industrial evolution influence was elaborated，inducing respective function mechanism, the agent and the mechanism. 6th、7th chapters，the tendency and the way of the current world industrial system evolution was discussed，and the agent and the evolution tendency on the industrial softening，the industrial convergence，the industrial ecologization，the economical service，the industrial internationalization，the high-tech industrialization，the industrial cluster，the industrial shift and the industrial integration was elaborated and studied 8th chapter，the content and the analysis method of the industrial structure rationalization and advancement，the industrial international competition strength and the industrial layout was proven. Based on the industrial structure optimization，the international competition enhancement and the layout optimization，the judgment standard and the request of the industrial evolution was analyzed. 9th chapter，the real diagnosis research into our country industrial evolution. On the light of all years statistics data of our country，the history and the present situation of our country industrial evolution was analyzed. The history of industrial structure evolution was reviewed，the present characteristics of the industrial structure was described，and the existent question and the reason analysis of the industrial structure was pointed out，the stage，the way，the influence factor and the future development tendency of our country three industries evolution was explored. The paper researched into industrial evolution rule and characteristics，and carried on the real diagnosis analysis to our country industrial evolution，so the work is the research foundation，research innovation mainly has following several aspects： 1、The basic principle on the organization theory，the non-linear dynamics，the new trade theory and the new growth theory and so on was utilized to research industry evolution rule，to infer the industrial evolution model. In the research，with the aid of to the logistic equation，the quantitative characteristics to the whole evolutionary process of industrial system were carried on the analysis，the industrial evolution model was carried on the discussion，the industrial life cycle and the industrial promotion process was analyzed，and the industrial evolution way was obtained. 2、The traditional industrial economics has simply induced the basic influence factors of industrial evolution，for instance：the demand factor，the supplies factor，the international factor and the system factor，unified with the industrial evolution rule，this article further deepened the basic influence factors of industrial evolution，has discussed respective action mechanism and the influence way. This article specially studied the industrial evolution microscopic factors on the enterprise，studied the influence of the flexible production，the market structure，the enterprise annexation，the division of labor and the high additional value on the industrial evolution. 3、The new way and tendency of industrial evolution in the contemporary world was studied，including：the industrial cluster，the industrial convergence，the industrial ecologization，the high-tech industrialization，the industrial internationalization，the economical service，and the industrial integration and so on. 4、The traditional economy growth theory only use the rationalization and advancement of the industrial structure to judge the degree and effect of industrial evolution，this article increased the enhancement of the industrial international competition and the optimization of the industrial layout to judgment standard，which consummated the judgment standard on the industrial evolution under the sustainable development theory. 5、Combined with the history and the present situation of our country industrial structure evolution，with all previous years datum in statistics yearbook，the process，the stage，the way，the influence factors and the future development tendency of our country industrial evolution was carried on the comprehensive and thorough research，the question and reason of industry evolution was analyzed，the strategic measure and the policy suggestion that advanced industrial evolution was proposed.

While there have been several major studies of the various national folk revivals during the 1950s, '60s and '70s, there is a paucity of scholarly accounts viewed through a regional lens. This study therefore builds on a common perception of North Eastern regional particularity to establish the ways in which the folk revival as experienced by its members within the region was distinct from that detailed in the literature on the wider (inter-)national folk scene. Using comparative examples drawn from the regional and international folk movements, the thesis contextualizes and differentiates the general trends within the second revival as a whole and its North Eastern manifestation. There are some evident discrepancies relating, for example, to levels of political involvement in the respective folk scenes but also broad similarities in chronological developments. These trends are explored through a number of themes, beginning with the weaving of a constructed regional folk-cultural identity out of a diversity of ethnic, local and occupational strands. Secondly, the common assumption that the North East is a region with a rare continuity of traditions is interrogated, alongside an acknowledgement that this was a time of rapid social change, mobility and dislocation from older cultural practices. The basic dichotomy of 'mediator' and `mediated' is questioned and found wanting, particularly in a region where young revivalists were rarely far — temporally, geographically or socially - from the source of their tradition. The ways in which the media represented and altered folk traditions, and how these representations were used to build regional consciousness is considered, as are the 1960s developments in heritage and tourism which saw vernacular culture taking on a much greater significance in the region's economy. Further, celebratory imagery is shown to have a long history in musical representations of the region, but with a contemporary focus on stoicism in the face of decline. Finally, the reasons behind the folklorists' imperative to locate the `authentic' are sought in relative degrees of alienation from contemporary society, resulting in a dissolution of the barriers between 'genuine' and 'invented' tradition.",1123925235,,Dissertations & Theses," Murphy, Judith A.MurphyA.JudithMurphy, Judith A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2802602341 , 73443412 , 101309 , U575005 , U575005 , http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/1731/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1123925235?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/1731/ , (UMI)AAIU575005 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Folk+on+tyne%3A+tyneside+culture+and+the+second+folk+revival%2C+1950-1975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Judith+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Politics of cinema under the Islamic Republic,"Based on ethnographically informed research, this thesis engages with the practices of production and reception of films in Iran and explores the politics of Iranian cinema in relation to its (post)revolutionary context. Arguing against the accepted views about film censorship in Iran, Chapter Two sheds light on the complexities in the workings of the Islamic state’s control of Iranian cinema.  It argues that in the absence of a clearly defined censorship code or a unitary censorship mechanism, there have been openings and opportunities for Iranian filmmakers to resist the state control and engage in social criticism. Examining the discourses around socially critical films, Chapter Three maintains that they are produced and received as a means to reflect upon the (post)revolutionary context. In addition, it examines how the filmmakers have used cinema as a means of consciousness raising in relation to social movements in Iran. Chapter Four explores the negotiations of gender at the moments of production and reception of the films about women’s issues.  The investigation shows that women engage with these films reflexively and in this process consider their personal experience as part of the larger political reality of the patriarchal order. In Chapter Five, the international prominence of Iranian cinema in relation to the politics of filmmaking and the discourses of identity is explored. This thesis concludes that owing to the complexities in the context of production and consumption of films in Iran, whether a film is political or not is difficult to determine from a distance by looking at film texts.  This is because researchers would run the risk of celebrating resistance where there may in fact be conformity or vice versa.",1415221016,,Dissertations & Theses," Zeydabadi-Nejad, S.Zeydabadi-NejadS.Zeydabadi-Nejad, S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031690571 , 45193541 , 101309 , U586144 , U586144", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415221016?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications,, 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," (UMI)AAIU586144 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Politics+of+cinema+under+the+Islamic+Republic&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zeydabadi-Nejad%2C+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"‘Something wicked this way comes’: the Russian delegation at the 1931 Second International Congress of the History of Science and Technology.,"The 1931 Second International Congress of the History of Science has acquired an iconic status in the modern discourse, yielding a plethora of misinterpretation and myth that serves to obscure the genuine significance and meaning of the event.  While many historians have viewed the congress from the perspective of the present, assuming a ‘quiet meeting of historians of science’ of standard academic character, its context and construction were nothing of the kind. Following the philosophical motivations of the organizing committee, especially the crucial figure of Charles Singer, the congress was designed to launch a public intellectual movement for the history of science.  The debates were carefully sequenced to demonstrate the contemporary and philosophical relevance of the history of science.  This thesis outlines Singer’s strategy and motivations. On the first day, a Russian delegation led by Nikolai Bukharin entered the arena.  Its composition reflected the fluid and complicated political situation facing Russian science, politics and philosophy during this period. There followed a series of debates on the relevance of the history of science and clashes on the political and social significance of the subject between the congress ‘mainstream’, the scientific left and the Russian delegation.  While some of this has been analysed in publication, there has never been detailed examination or even recourse to the proceedings record.  The most serious historical reinterpretation occurred regarding the Special Session, allegedly dedicated to the Russian delegation’s papers, which witnessed the crescendo of the confrontation between the Russians and Charles Singer.  This thesis outlines the developing controversies of the congress and an alternative account of the clash. The final level that reveals the unique character and timing of the congress is the social context of the event.  The thesis analyses the stream of social contexts affecting the event and the political consciousness of those present.",1415227259,,Dissertations & Theses," Chilvers, C.A.J.ChilversC.A.J.Chilvers, C.A.J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031690451 , 45251121 , 101309 , U588148 , U588148", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415227259?accountid=14496, 0585 Science history, 0585 Science history, 0585 Science history,, 0585 Science history, Science history," 559801 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%98Something+wicked+this+way+comes%E2%80%99%3A+the+Russian+delegation+at+the+1931+Second+International+Congress+of+the+History+of+Science+and+Technology.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chilvers%2C+C.A.J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Student teachers' attitudes to inclusion: implications for education in northern ireland,"The rationale for this research is based on an examination of student teachers’ attitudes towards inclusive education within the evolving educational environment of Northern Ireland. The overall aim was to investigate, identify, describe and analyse the key factors that influence student teachers’ attitudes, experiences and perceptions of inclusion during pre-service training.  The research is a case study.  The samples for the quantitative (n=125) and the qualitative (n=41; n=15) phases involved data collection through the use of a survey, a questionnaire, online discussion groups and interviews. One phase of the research is a small action research study involving a pedagogical intervention with the aim of improving practice. The research provides a singular viewpoint of a key stakeholder group and offers a unique and important contribution to the current international debate around issues relating to SEN and Inclusion. Findings provide evidence of positive attitudes towards the philosophy of inclusion with the majority of student teachers supporting the ideal of inclusive classrooms while finding the beliefs and aims behind the movement towards inclusion to be worthy.  Participants articulated the belief that inclusion was important for social integration and for building self-esteem, of upholding human rights and for promoting better understanding of diversity while offering equality of opportunity to all learners.  However, they also showed concern about how to make inclusion work in practice.  In common with many more experienced teachers they perceived difficulties in coping with large classes and in managing resources effectively.  At the end of the pre-service year while perceptions about personal efficacy had considerably increased, these anxieties remained. The effect of a successful teaching experience in a non-selective school had the most positive influence on perceived competency and on general attitudes towards inclusion.  This research concludes that those responsible for pre-service education in Northern Ireland should ensure that such school based experience is increased.",1779212380,,Dissertations & Theses," Lambe, JackieLambeJackieLambe, Jackie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013063201 , 103724492 , 101309 , U562019 , U562019", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779212380?accountid=14496, 0530 Teacher education, 0530 Teacher education, 0530 Teacher education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0530 Teacher education, Teacher education," 529573 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Student+teachers%27+attitudes+to+inclusion%3A+implications+for+education+in+northern+ireland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lambe%2C+Jackie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Situated cosmopolitanisms: notions of the 'other' in contemporary discourses on cosmopolitanism in britain and germany,"The thesis proposes to understand contemporary discourses on cosmopolitanism in Britain and Germany as situated outlooks influenced by specific national cultures and nation state histories. These discourses are also embedded in the transition of the current nation state order that is driven by global capitalism and new forms of social and legal integration. Within Europe, the legal integration project of the European Union has to be regarded as at the core of these contemporary discourses. While situating discourses of cosmopolitanism historically, the thesis traces back dominant discourses of commercial (Britain) and cultural (Germany) cosmopolitanism that influence contemporary national outlooks of British (David Held, Chantal Mouffe and Homi K. Bhabha) and German voices Qiirgen Habermas, Ulrich Beck and Hanna Behrend). The main argument is that those discourses are framed by historical pathways, particular memories and national horizons situated differently in various countries, but also situated differently regarding the social locations of concrete intellectuals engaging in these discourses. Thus, the analysis of the different authors' writings pursues a double aim. On the one hand, it explores to what degree national discourses are situated as hegemonic public communicative sphere historically; on the other, it reveals how specific voices are situated individually within the larger discourse, thereby unearthing their contribution to confirming or challenging a hegemonic discourse. Most significantly, the Utopian vision of a cosmopolitan 'opening' that evolved during the 1990s shifted to a hegemonic ideological discourse of European 'closure' after 9/11 2001. The analysis reveals the appearance of a discourse of European cosmopolitanism conveying cultural Europeanisation. Apparently, this discourse neglects the problematic legacy of a distinction that was typical for the German discourse of the late 19 th and lasting until the mid of the 20th century, i.e. the distinction between the world citizen (Weltbürger)and the cosmopolitan (Koswopolit). The former had a positive connotation of mobility whereas the latter was used as an anti-Semitic signifier for Jews as unwanted 'wanderers'. The contemporary discourse conveys still biased meanings of 'mobility' and 'migration' being decisive for e.g. the notion of EU citizenship as die privileging frame of free movement constructing new insides and outsides of populations.",1779537299,,Dissertations & Theses," Vieten, UlrikeVietenUlrikeVieten, Ulrike", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015106351 , 103122182 , 101309 , 10059785 , 10059785 , http://roar.uel.ac.uk/3397/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779537299?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://roar.uel.ac.uk/3397/ , (UMI)AAI10059785 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Situated+cosmopolitanisms%3A+notions+of+the+%27other%27+in+contemporary+discourses+on+cosmopolitanism+in+britain+and+germany&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vieten%2C+Ulrike&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Memories and the exigencies of national interest: an analysis of post-cold war sino-japanese and sino-russian strategic relations and perceptions,"The primary focus of this dissertation is to examine how social memories of major historical conflicts and confrontations affect the mutual strategic perceptions and the corresponding bilateral relations between China and her two closest neighbours - Japan and Russia. Despite the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet threat, Japan has not moved away from the United States strategically in order to balance US hegemony in the Asia Pacific. Japan instead chose to reaffirm the US-Japan security alliance in order to balance against a perceived rising China. At the same time, Russia rather than forging a closer relationship with the United States as predicted, instead sought to form a ""strategic partnership"" with China to counter US hegemony. While structural realists tell us that these could be explained as strategic balancing acts of states (against hegemony or threat), structural realism does not tell us when states choose to balance against threats and when states choose to balance against hegemony. The theoretical lens of economic interdependency does not quite adequately accounts for the behavior of these states in the post Cold War era either. Russia and China befuddle economic interdependency theorists with their warm political ties and low key economic relations, as do China and Japan with their vibrant economic relations but appallingly estranged political relationship. Various studies have pointed to the ""history"" factor as being responsible for this state of affair, but given that both Japan and Russia have pursued imperialistic policies towards China in the past hundred years, why should the PRC have so much antagonism with Japan but paradoxically enjoy close ties with Russia. The thesis therefore attempts to answer the theoretical puzzle posed by this abnormal state of affairs in post Cold War Asia-Pacific International Relations. The basic research question therefore asks if states are capable of bearing ""grudges"", and if so, why and how does this affect their foreign and security policy. In other words, what impact do memories of past conflicts or antagonism have for the behaviour of states. Drawing from the Constructivist literature, the thesis attempts to fill a theoretical lacuna posited by this empirical puzzle. The thesis weld the notion of social memories to Constructivism and in doing so, reflect how this approach can help examine the strategic movements of China, Japan and Russia in post Cold War Asia-Pacific, which economic interdependency and structural realism cannot adequately explain. The thesis argues that it is important to understand national interests in the ideational sense as much as it is to understand it in the material sense (as advocated by structural realism). Therefore, defending elements of a country's national identity (e.g. saying that a ""correct"" vision of history should be adopted) would be as equally important as defending a country's material interests. The thesis argues for the importance of social memories as a crucial element behind the change and continuity in each country's national identities. Without understanding the social memories in each country, one would not be able to comprehend the changes behind the national identities espoused by these states and their evolving definition of national interests (hence perception of various issues). At the same time, since constructivism emphasises the dialectical interactions between agency and structure, social memories are therefore not just important for the constitution of a state's identity and interests but also provide a social structure that shapes the state's foreign policy and bilateral relations. By advancing the notion of social memories to understand the research problematic, the thesis shows that it is possible for the ""grudge"" to build up and persist well beyond the conclusion of a conflict or confrontation. The genesis of this ""grudge"" therefore depends on the level of reconciliation and subsequent interactions and discourse relating to the conflict or confrontation. All these interactions are remembered and deposited into the social memory of the country which subsequently influences the definition of national identity, national interests and nationalism. The thesis maintains that in the Sino-Japanese case, there is actually very little reconciliation, and even if diplomatic gestures are made at the governmental level, it does not have the ""trickle down"" effect on the Chinese and Japanese nations respectively. In doing so, the thesis demonstrates that social memories are intricately linked to a very divergent evolution of national identities and mutual negative images in post-Cold War Japan and China.",1783041114,,Dissertations & Theses," Leong, Teo E.

This study draws attention to the social and structural barriers FTP migrants have and are still encountering within the milieu of immigration policy and practices from 1969 to 2003.  It particularly draws attention to FTP migrants' general settlement needs; raises doubts about current immigration selection policy based on the points system and recent immigration dispersal framework, and contributes in building knowledge regarding the effectiveness of both strategies. Although the focus of the study is on 'micro' level of analysis, a post-structuralist approach is applied to explore the wider 'macro' , and 'meso' (socio-cultural, economic and structural) factors that form the context of these experiences.  Layder's (1993) conceptualisation of research analysis is used to understand the underlying relationship between structure (i.e. 'social context' and 'institutional setting' ) and agency (i.e. 'situated activity ' and 'individual agency' ) influencing migrants' individual experiences. Data was collected through three fieldwork periods in the summers of 2001 to 2003. The sample comprises 42 semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with FTP migrants with professional qualifications, five with local service providers, and a further three with local stakeholders in London, Ontario.",301667985,,Dissertations & Theses," Rahbari, M.RahbariM.Rahbari, M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761114111 , 45192041 , 101309 , U233510 , U233510", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301667985?accountid=14496, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology,, 0624 Occupational psychology, Occupational psychology," DXN114403 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+marginalised+integration+accounts+of+foreign-trained+professional+migrants+in+Canada%3A+an+analysis+of+structural+and+institutional+barriers+to+integration&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rahbari%2C+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Exhibiting practice: retrospective survey exhibitions of conceptual art, 1989-2000.","In recent decades, the retrospective survey exhibition has become one of the primary sites for the presentation of art historical propositions. This thesis examines the contribution of four such exhibitions to a history of Conceptual art: L'Art Conceptuel, Une Perspective (Paris, 1989); Reconsidering the Object of Art, 1965-1975 (Los Angeles, 1995-96); Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin, 1950s-1980s ( New York, 1999); and Live in Your Head: Concept and Experiment in Britain, 1965-1975 (London, 2000). Through individual case studies, this thesis analyses the processes through which the history of this relatively recent art 'movement' has been elaborated. It seeks to understand how works of art can be accommodated to a museum-based art history and how they can be called upon to support particular curatorial narratives. At the same time, it considers to what extent they may be able to resist the conditions of display imposed upon them and may, instead, continue to signify independently of curatorial intention. In so doing, this thesis re-emphasizes the notion of critical practice, as well as the performative and discursive dimensions of Conceptual art that have often been passed over in historical exhibitions. It rejects the ""oppositional"" model of radical artists pitted against conservative institutions and argues for an understanding of Conceptual art based upon the recognition that claims for its independence from the institutional art world were made within the available rhetorics of a discourse that sustains the self-identities of both artists and institutions. Ultimately, this thesis reflects the understanding that to continue to regard artist and institution, artwork and exhibition, in their isolated functions is to fail to attend to the ways in which art, as a social practice may support broader ideological structures.",301720815,,Dissertations & Theses," Palmer, D.PalmerD.Palmer, D.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761130231 , 45194881 , 101309 , U228975 , U228975", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301720815?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," DXN109924 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exhibiting+practice%3A+retrospective+survey+exhibitions+of+conceptual+art%2C+1989-2000.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Palmer%2C+D.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The 3, 4, 5 literature: ideopolitical-moral education in mainland china as a barometer of political and economic change","Moral education is inseparable from ideology and politics in China. This study investigates the rise and fall of the ""3,4,5 literature"" and its related movement. The ""3,4,5 literature"" (the New Three Character Classic, Four Character Song of Social Ethics and Five Character Rhyme of Family Ethics) were bestselling moral education texts generated in Guangdong, a southern SEZ, since the adoption of a policy of opening up the economy in 1978. This study employed the method of content analysis to identify distinctive values embedded in the 3,4,5 literature and other related moral texts. Major stakeholders involved in the development of the 3,4,5 literature were interviewed in order to understand the dynamic process of the 3,4,5 movement. In addition, documentary analysis was employed to show how the government's policy on ideopolitical-moral education led to the rise and the fall of the 3,4,5 literature and to assess the implications of the 3,4,5 literature for the government in formulating its subsequent policies in ideopolitical-moral education. The findings of this study indicated the pioneering role of the 3,4,5 literature in the reform of ideopolitical-moral education in China. Ideopolitical-moral education in China is currently characterized by concerns for students' psychological health, moral qualities, democracy and legal education rather than political themes. This study also shows that a de-politicization in ideopolitical-moral education resulted from decentralization, with greater autonomy granted to the regions. In turn, this made it possible to professionalize ideopolitical-moral education. The professionalisation made it possible to free ideopolitical-moral education from party dogma, in other words to secularise it. All this was made possible by the rapid social transition initiated by market-oriented reforms. Nevertheless, in spite of decentralization and regionalization, the national government remained highly influential. This study also reveals the sustaining power of traditional ethics in current ideopolitical-moral education and its power in maintaining official legitimacy and moral authority as China increasingly integrates with the global world economy. Finally, the study depicts the changes in methods of political socialization. These were initiated by economic liberalization rather than changes in political system. It is hoped that the findings will enhance the understanding of recent development of ideopolitical-moral education in China and add to existing knowledge of such research fields as culture, political socialization and soft-power.",301722163,,Dissertations & Theses," Ho, Chi-hangHoChi-hangHo, Chi-hang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761082541 , 45183851 , 101309 , U228506 , U228506", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301722163?accountid=14496, 0527 Religious education, 0527 Religious education, 0527 Religious education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0527 Religious education, Religious education," DXN111233 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+3%2C+4%2C+5+literature%3A+ideopolitical-moral+education+in+mainland+china+as+a+barometer+of+political+and+economic+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ho%2C+Chi-hang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A comparison of patient functional characteristics and outcomes across two psychiatric outpatient programs: A continuing day treatment program and a psychsocial clubhouse,"Since the deinstitutionalization movement in the 1950s and 1960s, there has been a proliferation of community-based treatment programs and services. Many programs have been shown to be effective with some types of patients. However, it still is unknown which types of programs, services, and interventions are most appropriate for which types of patients, and which stages of their illnesses. Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that most community-based programs are not implemented with the same commitment used in the clinical trials, which established their efficacy. Several questions remain, and are the focus of this study. First, is the multitude of community-based programs necessary or justifiable given the realities and limitations of rehabilitation psychiatry? Do most community-based psychiatry programs serve the same patients with the same results? Which patients benefit from community-based psychiatry programs and which do not? The objectives of this study are (1) to identify the type of Seriously Mentally Ill patient that is best served by two types of community-based treatment programs (a continuing day treatment program and a psychosocial clubhouse), and (2) to empirically establish a set of objective demographic and psychological predictors of success at the two types of programs. The study accomplished these objectives by comparing client and member functioning at a continuing day treatment program and a psychosocial clubhouse for patients who have been at one program or the other for a short period of time (less than three years) and a longer period of time (between three and six years). The study is a between-subject 2 X 2 design, in which the variables are program type and length of tenure in the program. Much of the data in the study was obtained from existing patient records from each program site. Additional information was gathered through a battery of tests and self-report measures, including: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) portions of the Scale to Assess the Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD), the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence second edition (TONI-2), the Social Adjustment Scale second edition (SAS-2), the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-30), the Level of Expressed Emotion Scale (LEE), and the Influential Relationships Questionnaire (IRQ). Data analysis was comprised of a series of correlation and two-way, between-subject ANOVAs based on a separate analysis for each of the dependent measures. The results of this study indicate that regardless of program type, individuals are hospitalized less with more years of participation, day treatment program clients report more trouble with substance abuse, clubhouse members have a better understanding of the need for medication and better adjustment to social and leisure time. Some characteristics were also found to be predictive of positive outcomes in either day treatment or clubhouse participation.",304702845,,Dissertations & Theses," Karp, Samuel H.KarpH.SamuelKarp, Samuel H.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1407505471 , 38008491 , 66569 , 9780549075059 , 3268328 , 3268328", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549075059, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304702845?accountid=14496, 0622 Psychotherapy, 0622 Psychotherapy, 0622 Psychotherapy,, 0622 Psychotherapy, Psychotherapy," Psychology , Day treatment , Functional characteristics , Outpatient , Patient , Psychiatric , Psychsocial clubhouse",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+comparison+of+patient+functional+characteristics+and+outcomes+across+two+psychiatric+outpatient+programs%3A++A+continuing+day+treatment+program+and+a+psychsocial+clubhouse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Karp%2C+Samuel+H.&amp;isbn=9780549075059&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A place for family farming: Food sovereignty in Uruguay,"In order to reverse the decline of small-scale farming in Latin America, many social movements on the political left are advocating ""agroecology"" and ""food sovereignty"". Agroecology is an approach that places biological and cultural diversity at the foundation of agricultural systems. The concept of food sovereignty relates to the orientation to international trade. Proponents of food sovereignty argue that the priority of food systems should focus on local producers and consumers, who should also decide how the system functions. In Uruguay, the creation of a citizens' proposal called ""Sustainable Uruguay"" has brought together rural and urban organizations in efforts to create an alternative plan for the country. A central principle is the need for national policies for food sovereignty. I carried out fieldwork to examine the connection between these ideas and the views and practices of horticultural family farmers in a locality in the northeast of the department of Canelones. This region has seen negative environmental impacts from the use of chemical fertilizers and monocropping. It was also affected by trade liberalization in the 1970s, which led to the collapse of a national agroindustry oriented to the domestic market. My analysis, based on research in the region and particularly with an organic cooperative, indicates that agroecology methods have been beneficial for farmer autonomy, health and environmental protection. Several of the local strategies and skills were crucial for making the transition to organic production. Vital to the relative success of organic producers has also been their participation in organizations to develop markets and to exert political influence. Many leaders of Uruguayan organizations representing small producers point out the cultural value of family farms and critique the production-driven model of agriculture. They demand differential policies for protection of family farms and for the revitalization of rural areas in general. Some rural organizations have begun to explore ideas relating to agroecology and food sovereignty, which push further the critique of industrial agriculture and commonly-accepted notions of development. These organizations collaborate with environmental and union organizations that espouse these views and that are part of international networks, such as those that participate in Sustainable Uruguay forums. This thesis presents two interlinked elements key to the collaboration between organizations in Sustainable Uruguay: its methods and the framing and substance of its proposals. The horizontal and long-term nature of the participatory methods has been essential to be able to overcome divisions and foster common understanding and collaboration. The food sovereignty proposal has become the backbone of the forum's platform on agriculture because it is an idea that responds to the needs and demands of the workers, farmers and environmentalists involved. Such alliances may be significant for helping to bridge the rural-urban divisions that exacerbate neglect of the crisis in family farming. Crucial to this effort, I argue, is an understanding of the cultural and affective relations between farmers and their homes and livelihoods.",304759115,,Dissertations & Theses," Oliver, BeatrizOliverBeatrizOliver, Beatriz", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1737860741 , 38304081 , 66569 , 9780494479520 , NR47952 , NR47952", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494479520, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304759115?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0473 Agriculture , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0473 Agriculture , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0473 Agriculture , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0473 Agriculture , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Cultural anthropology , Agriculture , Agricultural economics"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agroecology , Family farming , Food sovereignty , Organic production , Uruguay",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+place+for+family+farming%3A+Food+sovereignty+in+Uruguay&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Oliver%2C+Beatriz&amp;isbn=9780494479520&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The homiletic dimension of small Christian communities,"This thesis project explores the homiletic dimension of small Christian communities and proposes strategies to enhance the quality of their preaching conversations. Chapter one lays a solid theological foundation for understanding preaching as conversation by using David Tracy's work on conversation and theological method to construct a theology of preaching. Chapter two begins with a brief history of the development of small Christian communities in the United States and the influence of RENEW International on their emergence. It then examines the key facets of the liturgical homily as restored by the Second Vatican Council and shows how these facets are operative in small Christian communities today. Chapter three presents a contextual biblical hermeneutical process that is informed by conversation and grounded in praxis based on the work of philosophers Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricœur, and South African biblical scholar Gerard West. This process addresses the weaknesses in the homiletic dimension of small communities---the lack of critical analysis of Scripture, the hearer's cultural context, and a movement toward social action. Chapter four applies the theoretical groundwork laid by the first three chapters to the development of a faith-sharing resource entitled Word Alive: Conversations on the Sunday Gospels, Advent, Year C . These four sessions included as Appendix A are designed for small Christian communities to test whether intentionally adding to the preaching conversation a critical study of Scripture in dialogue with the American context will improve the quality of the group's homiletic experience. Chapter five reports on and draws conclusions from the Word Alive survey results. It indicates areas for further exploration regarding continuing ways to strengthen the preaching conversation in small Christian communities and implications for the enhancement of liturgical preaching.",304790620,,Dissertations & Theses," Rickard, Theresa A.RickardA.TheresaRickard, Theresa A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1273142531 , 35856751 , 66569 , 3247605 , 3247605", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304790620?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0469 Theology"," 0459 Communication , 0469 Theology"," 0459 Communication , 0469 Theology",," 0459 Communication , 0469 Theology"," Communication , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Christian , Communities , Conversation , Homiletic , Preaching",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+homiletic+dimension+of+small+Christian+communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rickard%2C+Theresa+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Red pulp: Repression and radicalism in mid-twentieth century United States ""genre"" fiction","Red Pulp recuperates, resituates, and re-evaluates the voluminous mid-century mass culture production of a series of once-popular, subsequently suppressed left-wing U.S. writers of ""genre"" fiction. More specifically, it is to date the first full-length, close study of three different re-emerging progressive, anti-racist writers of this period: Guy Endore, Paul William Ryan, and Len Zinberg. Doubly derided by critics and censors as ""Red"" and as ""pulp"" writers, the subjects of my study deserve critical and popular reconsideration, I argue, for reasons political, historical, and literary. All three writers' work defies current categorizations of American Left writing, combining, in heretofore unnoticed ways, explicitly radical, proletarian and anti-racist social commentary, modernist formal experimentation, and sensational, at times seemingly conservative, even reactionary aspects of ""pulp""—that is, hard-boiled, detective, adventure, and horror fiction. My study of these writers' varied work, work which was often produced under pseudonyms, and in contexts conditioned by political persecution, calls into question prevalent historical notions of how the ""Old"" Left related to mass culture, how it thought about race, racism, and imperialism, and of how successfully the Communist cultural Left's opposition to U.S. racism was ""silenced"" during the Cold War. In chapter one I critically review the scholarly literature regarding the generic tendencies, limitations, and politics of ""pulp fiction"" as a subset of mass-cultural forms. I engage with Marxist cultural theorists such as Fredric Jameson, Ernest Mandel, Antonio Gramsci, and Teodor Adorno, as well as figures within and American and cultural studies such as Michael Denning, and recent reader-response, and working-class studies interpreters of pulp fiction, such as Erin Smith. Synthesizing and complicating each of these theorists take on pulp, I argue for an understanding of pulp fiction as a contradictory medium for the articulation of left-wing politics to an American mass audience in the early-to-mid Twentieth Century. I further track this account of pulp fiction in relationship to the ongoing literary-historical recovery and revaluating work being done on the U.S. Literary Left. Barbara Foley, Denning, Alan Wald and others in this vein have documented and begun to map the complicated and long-suppressed terrain of American literary radicalism of the mid-20 th century. Red Pulp is an effort to complicate and expand our understanding of proletarian or revolutionary American fiction beyond the overly narrow notion of the term currently either affirmed (or more often, dismissed) by contemporary scholars and critics of the period. In each subsequent chapter of Red Pulp, I examine these left literary works in close detail. I demonstrate in each case how the work of Endore, Zinberg, and Ryan, is sophisticated, self-reflexive, and ironic in ways not previously noticed. I further argue that returning left-wing, Jewish, and working-class writers, such as Guy Endore, Len Zinberg, and Paul William Ryan, to the ""pulp"" contexts and discourses where they belong forces us to rethink the status of these popular discourses and their historical development. In chapters two through four I turn to the life and works of Guy Endore, author of among other novels, the best-selling horror ""classic"" Werewolf of Paris (1933) and Babouk (1934), a sensational, experimental historical novel about the Haitian Revolution. Endore's work and its reception reveal both the tremendous possibilities but also the formidable dangers and limitations of appropriating conservative established mass-cultural generic confines for ""progressive"" ends. Positioning Endore biographically, politically, and discursively, in part through the examination of materials unearthed by original archival research at the Endore Papers held at UCLA, I argue that he occupied a productively liminal location within/without the burgeoning American mass culture industries, and the growing Communist-led cultural movement of the Depression. In each of these three chapters I position Endore's work in relationship to a different mass-popular genre; historical fiction, horror fiction, US colonialist writing on Haiti, respectively. In chapters five and six I turn to the work of Paul William Ryan, who maintained dual, concurrent—and I argue, interrelated—writing careers: as a West Coast proletarian journalist, political poet, and pamphleteer, under the name ""Mike Quin,"" and as a successful writer of pulp fiction novels immediately after WWII and on the cusp of the Cold War under the pseudonym ""Robert Finnegan."" In chapter seven and eight I examine the voluminous literary production of Len Zinberg, better known as international best-selling pulp writer, ""Ed Lacy."" Zinberg's early works such as his anti-racist boxing thriller Walk Hard-Talk Loud (1939), and his critical bilndungsroman of an ex-radical journalist, Hold with the Hares (1947) reveal sophisticated but explicit left-critiques of American society, while his later pulp works maintain a subtle, subversive, at time subdued, but nonetheless consistent left commentary on U.S. post-war racism, imperialism, and American Big Business.

My historical and contextual analysis examines what was at stake for the Surrealists faced with exile, clandestine activities conducted by Main à Plume during the German Occupation, and a radically changed postwar cultural milieu. I scrutinize Surrealist practice as visual strategy, intellectual history, political engagement, and cultural critique. Postwar Surrealism established its position in relation to the strategies of Jean-Paul Sartre's Existentialism, the cultural policies of the French Communist Party (P.C.F.) articulated by Louis Aragon, and the re-emerging Parisian avant-garde. I analyze how artists, writers, and group exhibitions made concrete the expanded wartime boundaries of the movement and how physical sites of exile informed Surrealist activities. War-era journals—View, VVV, and Dyn—provided intellectual spaces for the promotion of both Surrealist ideas and dissent among members of the group. I also consider André Breton's search for a new Surrealist myth, an inquest that paralleled the contemporary preoccupation with mythical subjects among Abstract Expressionists such as Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, and Jackson Pollock. To address the Surrealists' return to France, I utilize the sociological theory of boundary disputes to assess how postwar ideological clashes established parameters of debates. Significantly, I argue that the Communist and Existentialist intelligentsia defined themselves in relation to the Surrealists, and kept the group in public view until its first exhibition of the postwar period, Surrealism in 1947. The poetic origins, international roster, and critical reception of the exhibition, which promoted esotericism and mythical initiation, are examined as well. Shifting postwar definitions of 'real' and 'realism' are also analyzed, and the approach of Surrealist artists and writers—Georges Bataille, Victor Brauner, Charles Duits, Jindrich Heisler, and Toyen, among others—is compared with that of Socialist Realism (adopted as official P.C.F. policy in 1947) and the brute materialism of Jean Dubuffet. In the broadest terms, this dissertation explores to what extent artistic practice can be bound to social practice, and how the Surrealists modified yet maintained their carefully crafted revolutionary mantle.",304842198,,Dissertations & Theses," Adams, Ellen E.AdamsE.EllenAdams, Ellen E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1436357221 , 35766391 , 66569 , 9780549295655 , 3284275 , 3284275", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549295655, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304842198?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Avant-garde , Bataille, Georges , Breton, Andre , France , Intellectual history , Surrealism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=After+the+rain%3A+Surrealism+and+the+post-World+War+II+avant-garde%2C+1940%E2%80%931950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Adams%2C+Ellen+E.&amp;isbn=9780549295655&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Suzanne Noël: Beauty, feminism, and cosmetic surgery in early twentieth century France","In this dissertation I examine the life of Suzanne Noël (1878-1954) who was both a feminist and a cosmetic surgeon. Although it may appear that a combined representation of both the beliefs of a modern French feminist and that of a pioneer and innovator of cosmetic surgical procedures are diametrically challenging, in reality they were both embodied and exemplified by Noël. This dissertation places Dr. Suzanne de Noël in the history of plastic surgery as an innovator, promoter, and popularizer. Her life is set within the context of a beauty culture as it was formulated in early twentieth century France and within the context that was understood as the ""New Woman"" who was not only the image of energetic beauty, intellectual competency, but who gregariously took new liberties within the social arena. This dissertation is organized into six chapters. In chapters one and two I examine the bibliography of Noël and her place in the historiography of the History of Medicine. Chapter three is an analysis of her work in regard to the Soroptimist International which she helped found. In chapter four I develop a correlation between the rise of a beauty culture in France and the effect that culture had on Noël and her profession as a cosmetic surgeon. In chapter five I explore Noël's discourse through her cosmetic surgical publications and text.

Increasingly, large carnivores are forced to adjust to living in landscapes characterized by human activity and disturbance. It is therefore critical to understand both the extent to which carnivores can adjust to human activities and the factors influencing human tolerance of their presence. Here I document the activity patterns and space use of three social groups, or clans, of spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ) in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya that vary in exposure to humans, and investigate the degree to which these behaviors are influenced by human activity, primarily in the form of livestock grazing. I also investigate the issue of local tolerance of carnivores with an intensive study of livestock depredation. Hyenas were active during 31.5 ± 2.7% of the 24-h period, and 96.2 ± 0.9% of all activity occurred from 1800-0900 h. Male spotted hyenas tended to be more active, and exhibit higher movement rates than females. Female hyenas in territories with daily livestock grazing showed lower activity and den use than hyenas in an undisturbed territory during the times of day when livestock grazing coincided with potential hyena activity. Space use patterns of hyenas with no exposure to livestock grazing were influenced by the location of the communal den, and the distribution of prey, vegetation types, and water features within their territory. Relative to this clan, hyenas exposed to livestock grazing showed a stronger avoidance of open grass plains and a weaker association with prey resources and den location. However, the distribution of livestock did not directly influence hyena space use patterns, indicating that increased use of vegetative cover by hyenas may be an important behavioral shift allowing temporary coexistence with livestock and their herdsmen. Hyena home range size, core area size, and core area location were influenced by the presence of a refuse pit at the edge of one study clan's territory. The most common rank group utilizing the pit was low-ranking females, and regular pit users were more likely to be found near the pit during times of relative prey scarcity. These results indicate that human refuse at pastoral villages may increase hyena use of these environments, and that this use may vary on a seasonal and individual level. Spotted hyenas, leopards ( Panthera pardus ) and lions ( Panthera leo ) were responsible for 53%, 32%, and 15% of attacks on livestock, respectively, that were documented along a Reserve border. Monthly depredation frequency was correlated positively with rainfall and negatively with natural prey abundance. The spatial location and size of local villages, and the fence type used at livestock enclosures influenced the vulnerability of these locations to livestock losses, with leopards and hyenas showing clear differences in selection of attack locations. Overall, improved fences, more watch dogs, and high levels of human activity were not associated with lower livestock losses to predators.",304844202,,Dissertations & Theses," Kolowski, Joseph MarkKolowskiMarkJosephKolowski, Joseph Mark", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1354130751 , 36958371 , 66569 , 9780549029700 , 3264177 , 3264177", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549029700, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304844202?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology"," 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology"," 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology",," 0329 Ecology , 0472 Zoology"," Ecology , Zoology"," Biological sciences , Anthropogenic , Carnivores , Kenya , Serengeti National Park",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Anthropogenic+influences+on+the+behavior+of+large+carnivores+in+the+northern+Serengeti+ecosystem&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kolowski%2C+Joseph+Mark&amp;isbn=9780549029700&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Peasant mobilization, land reform and agricultural co-operativism in Brazil: The case of the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), 1984–2004","This dissertation examines the interplay of peasant mobilization, land reform and agricultural co-operativism in Brazil from 1984 to 2004. Its context is the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), which is considered the most dynamic force for progressive social change in Latin America today. This dissertation uses an integrated macro-micro theoretical perspective in order to examine peasant mobilization, agrarian reform, and co-operative formation from a more balanced and nuanced approach. The integrated neo-Marxist and Sustainable Rural Livelihoods (SRLs) theoretical approach is supported by fieldwork in three Brazilian states (Paraná, São Paulo, and Goiás). Its central thesis is as follows: the MST's community-based model of land reform has great potential for effectively promoting SRLs. Yet, in the long-term, without ongoing state and international support, the MST has limited capacity for sustaining, let alone furthering, this model of land reform. Brazil has historically been a country with highly concentrated landownership. Chronic landlessness, increased rural poverty, and eventually environmental destruction, intensified in the 1960s and subsequent decades with the introduction of agricultural modernization. Globalization has further accentuated this situation. Currently, almost 46 percent of the country's total registered agricultural land belongs to less than 1 percent of landowners, over 20 million rural people live in abject poverty, and more than 4 million families are landless. The MST has vigorously contested this situation. It has effectively practiced the politics of land occupation to advance a luta pela terra (the struggle for land). It has also eagerly cultivated the politics of agricultural co-operativism to advance a luta na terra (the struggle on the land). However, the processes of land occupation and co-operative formation have often been difficult, conflict-ridden, and, in some cases, divisive. Also, limited access to financial, educational, technological, and commercialization resources has significantly contributed to the MST's difficulties. Despite setbacks, limitations, and uncertainties, the MST has established an effective, grassroots, community-based model of land reform that offers great potential for reducing structural poverty and food insecurity, enhancing peasant identity, strengthening democratic participation, and promoting environmental conservation in rural Brazil. The main conclusions of this dissertation are seventh-fold: first, land reform has had a limited impact on land inequality and rural poverty; second, concerted peasant mobilization is fundamental to achieving access to resources necessary for SRLs; third, the nurturing of a culture of co-operation and the culture of solidarity are vital to enhancing community participation in the pursuit of SRLs; fourth, the promotion of SRLs is inherently a political and conflictual process; fifth, interpersonal and group conflicts obstruct the pursuit of SRLs; sixth, the incorporation of principles of conflict resolution or conflict management into SRLs approaches is essential to overcoming internal obstacles; and seventh, the state has to play a major role in supporting community-based SRLs by providing access to financial, educational, technological, and human resources.",304850312,,Dissertations & Theses," Robles-Calderon, WilderRobles-CalderonWilderRobles-Calderon, Wilder", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1428847921 , 36465071 , 66569 , 9780494336199 , NR33619 , NR33619", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494336199, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304850312?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," Agricultural economics , Economic history , Peasants , Land reform , Agricultural cooperatives , Studies"," Social sciences , Agricultural cooperativism , Brazil , Land reform , Landless Rural Workers Movement , Peasant mobilization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Peasant+mobilization%2C+land+reform+and+agricultural+co-operativism+in+Brazil%3A+The+case+of+the+Landless+Rural+Workers+Movement+%28MST%29%2C+1984%E2%80%932004&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robles-Calderon%2C+Wilder&amp;isbn=9780494336199&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Radical form, political intent: Delineating countercinemas beyond Godard","This study argues that ""countercinema"" describes a fluid, potentially global practice which integrates radical formal intervention with political intent, in historically specific contexts. This practice both limits and expands past and present applications of the term. It includes more than the list of formal characteristics with which Peter Wollen (accurately) characterizes Godard's countercinema in 1972, but limits countercinema to those films which are formally radical, politically-minded and historically specific, rather than any film or practice which is non-patriarchal, non-capitalist and/or non-Hollywood. Countercinema is more specific than ""art cinema,"" ""world cinema"" or ""independent film,"" and while it crosses those categories, it cannot be cleanly encompassed by any of them. Even Hollywood produces countercinema. This study includes films from the sixties to the nineties, further detaching countercinema not only strictly from Godard's practice but also from the specific mass-social politics of the sixties. The five case studies undertaken in this study include countercinema produced by Godard in France, Glauber Rocha in Brazil, Dusan Makaejev in Yugoslavia, Chantal Akerman in Belgium and New York, and Gregg Araki in Los Angeles. Ranging from new wave movements to national cinema to minimalist feminism and New Queer Cinema, these case studies are deployed to argue that ""countercinema"" is a valuable term useful for describing a specific kind of political film-making and that such film-making can be located (both in the present and in the past) by its radical form, political intent and historical specificity.",304850967,,Dissertations & Theses," Kinsman, Robert PatrickKinsmanPatrickRobertKinsman, Robert Patrick", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1317346101 , 35226191 , 66569 , 3256798 , 3256798", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304850967?accountid=14496, 0900 Motion pictures, 0900 Motion pictures, 0900 Motion pictures,, 0900 Motion pictures, Motion pictures," Communication and the arts , Akerman, Chantal , Araki, Gregg , Belgium , Brazil , Cinema , Countercinemas , France , Godard, Jean-Luc , Jean-Luc Godard , Makaejev, Dusan , Political intent , Radical form , Rocha, Glauber , United States , Yugoslavia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Radical+form%2C+political+intent%3A+Delineating+countercinemas+beyond+Godard&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kinsman%2C+Robert+Patrick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Coca leaf and sindicato democracy in the Bolivian Yungas: The Andeanization of Western political models and the rise of the New Left,"In 1953, Bolivia's indigenous peasantry carried out one of Latin America's most successful agrarian reforms, in which the Spanish feudal system was abolished. In place of the hacienda estates in the highland Yungas region were established rural Aymara communities with a novel form of political economic organization: European syndicalism. Over the next 50 years, this system originally designed for Western labor unions was adapted to meet the exigencies of semi-subsistence livelihoods and turned into functioning structures for rural community government, called sindicatos. As these communal systems lay outside the formal state structure, the rise of sindicalismo also represented the formation of civil society in the Yungas after four centuries of colonialism and elite republicanism. Coca leaf has been cultivated for a millennium in the Yungas, which is now the primary legal zone to supply Bolivia's domestic markets for medicinal, nutritional, and ceremonial uses of the leaf. Coca has also been targeted for eradication in the U.S. “war on drugs,” sparking fierce resistance by the sindicatos to defend the economic mainstay of Yungas campesinos. The symbolic force of the “sacred leaf” combined with cultural memories of historical Aymara revolutionary heroes have helped to organize the Yungas sindicatos into one of the country's most influential social movements. This dissertation argues that the methods of sindicato resistance are gleaned from long traditions of democratic governance, drawing on both labor union syndicalism and the ancient Aymara ayllu system. Coca leaf has provided an especially potent impetus for campesino advocacy in the Yungas, placing the sindicatos at the center of civil society efforts to counterbalance the power of the state and international interests. Bolivia's neoliberal political reforms via the Law of Popular Participation of 1994 and the Law of Citizen Groups and Indigenous Peoples of 2004 expanded the range of options for civil society participation in local and national government. These structural changes enhanced the ability of the sindicatos to defend the coca economy and promote new policies for the leaf through democratic political engagement. Anthropology has only recently become devoted to the ethnographic analysis of democracy, which has deepened the study of the diverse methods, discourses, and structural potentials for democratic organization across historical cultural contexts. This dissertation contributes to this emerging practice by showing not only how Yungas sindicalismo is a viable form of community democracy, but also how its role as a principal civil society actor is helping to strengthen (and hybridize) Bolivia's precarious democratic traditions at the municipal and national levels. With the election of Evo Morales to the presidency in December 2005, it is also clear that agrarian sindicalismo has directly contributed to the rise of the new Left in Bolivia.",304886907,,Dissertations & Theses," Conzelman, Caroline SommerConzelmanSommerCarolineConzelman, Caroline Sommer", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1383470111 , 36224381 , 66569 , 9780549142645 , 3273741 , 3273741", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549142645, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304886907?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Political science"," Social sciences , Andeanization , Bolivia , Coca , New Left , Sindicato democracy , Western political models , Yungas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Coca+leaf+and+sindicato+democracy+in+the+Bolivian+Yungas%3A+The+Andeanization+of+Western+political+models+and+the+rise+of+the+New+Left&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Conzelman%2C+Caroline+Sommer&amp;isbn=9780549142645&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Communal violence in Gujarat: Rethinking the role of communalism and institutionalized injustices in India,"Five years have passed since Narendra Modi's, Bharatiya Janata Party state government unleashed an ethnic genocide/pogrom against the Muslims in Gujarat. This thesis explores communal violence between Hindus and Muslims in Gujarat, uncovering its history and impact on inter-communal relations, as well as approaches to prevention. The causes of communal violence are assessed by examining conflict theory, communalism, and communal violence in India through testimonies and interviews of victims/survivors of communal violence. The state government's institutionalization of communalism and communalization as a process, as well as their impact on society are analyzed exposing and outlining communalist tactics in an effort to understand its advocates' strategic successes. Resistance to the communalization process is also examined through interviews with members of the anti-communalization movement and a discussion of their respective programs and activities in order to determine the latter's type and level of impact on the occurrence of communal violence. Recommendations on approaches to preventing communal violence include: (1) initiating a process through which justice and reconciliation can be sought by and for victims/survivors and perpetrators, (2) resisting further communalization and polarization of society, (3) implementing mechanisms of early warning and detection of genocide, 1 and (4) promoting a culture of social justice, human rights, and equality of all citizens. The lessons learned through the case of Gujarat are important for assessing other conflicts of deeply divided societies by highlighting the integral role of the state, as well as individuals or movements who have vested interests or benefit directly from conflict as units of analysis. Thus, this study calls on scholars of peace and conflict resolution to incorporate a particular lens or paradigm into their methodology by asking: Who is benefiting from this conflict? How can conflicts become less profitable? 1 For the purposes of this paper the terms genocide, massacre, pogrom, and carnage will be used interchangeably to refer to the genocide that took place in Gujarat in 2002. In Chapter 3 Theoretical Approaches to Inter-Communal Conflict, the case for how the violence that took place in Gujarat, in 2002, was genocide according to international legal definitions of genocide.",304893640,,Dissertations & Theses," Peer, YasmeenPeerYasmeenPeer, Yasmeen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1510544751 , 39741031 , 66569 , 9780549517535 , 1452645 , 1452645", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549517535, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304893640?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0332 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0332 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0332 History , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," History , International law , International relations , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communal+violence+in+Gujarat%3A+Rethinking+the+role+of+communalism+and+institutionalized+injustices+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peer%2C+Yasmeen&amp;isbn=9780549517535&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Servant-leadership. Shifting paradigms/empowering people: A content analysis of servant-leadership,"This is a study of the sociology of culture and the dissemination of servant-leadership philosophy within our institutions. Robert Wuthnow's work is framed within the context of cultural structuralism. Wuthnow's cultural analysis theory synthesizes several theoretical traditions. His work is a blend of dramaturgy, institutional analysis, and subjective approaches (Turner, 1998:504). We will explore the reinforcing collective values of servant-leadership, the embellishment of certain messages within servant-leadership, and the particular activities which produce the system of cultural codes and facilitate their integration into institutions within our society. The founder of servant-leadership philosophy, Robert Greenleaf (1904-1990), was employed by American Telephone and Telegraph and worked within the management, research development, and education departments of the company. Upon his retirement from AT&amp;T, Greenleaf started down his second career path as a teacher and consultant, working with a wide range of institutions from The Harvard Business School to the Ford Foundation, including visiting lecturer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management and teaching positions at both Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia (www.areenleaf.org ). Robert Greenleaf coined the term ""Servant-Leadership"" and developed the philosophy of servant-leadership. During the 1960s, the civil unrest that plagued the country's universities and communities was alarming to Greenleaf and inspired him to write his first essay on the philosophy of Servant-Leadership. ""The Servant as Leader"" is the 37-page manuscript that sparked an international movement that is referred to as ""Servant-Leadership"". We will explore the themes of servant-leadership and examine how they have evolved into a belief system. Wuthnow's view that moral codes are "" a set of cultural elements that define the nature of commitment to a particular course of behavior "" (Turner, 1998:505) is critical to our quest. This paper also includes an analysis of selected cultural institutions in order to determine the extent of the dissemination and its evolution from a philosophy into an institutionalized leadership model. Many organizations have experienced dramatic transformations since passing into the new millennium. We can assume that leadership is also manifesting change. Many people in positional power still behave in a manner which is commensurate with their past experience and their requirements for success. That model, however, belongs to an earlier era. Our current era is in transition. It appears to be concerned with ""empowering"" leadership. The leadership styles which have flowed from our past paradigms are possibly problematic in creating the kind of organization that will thrive in our increasingly globalized society. Consistent with the theories that focus on a leader's qualities, servant-leadership addresses the leader's personal characteristics. Such characteristics may be developed by anyone with a commensurate value system. Wuthnow addresses three aspects that are "" critical to structuring the moral order: (1)  Moral objects versus real programs , (2)  core self versus enacted social roles , and (3)  inevitable constraints versus intentional options "" (Turner, 1998:505). The ""old school"" view of leaders singled out specific attributes as ""dynamic"", ""charismatic"", and other ""force-of-personality"" factors which appeared to be ""natural born"" traits rather than acquired ones (Shamir, House, Arthur, 1993:577-594). The new calling for servant-leaders looks instead to the traits that flow from a natural, deeply held belief system which identifies the worth of a person. Therefore, a leader's traits remain an important factor, but in the servant-leadership paradigm, any person may cultivate the desired traits as he or she draws from a set of fundamental precepts that dissolve borders and transcend race and culture (www.green leaf.org). Wuthnow's stated that ideologies are "" vehicles for change in the moral order because the moral order is altered through the development and subsequent institutionalization of new ideologies "" (Turner, 1998:507) Servant-leadership cuts across the traditional authoritarian leadership theories and provides a new foundational philosophy that emphasizes principles congruent with human growth. In addition to similarities with the trait theories, servant-leadership is similar to behavioral theories, in that the leader's behavior is of critical importance. The old saying, ""Management sets the precedence"", is absolute within the servant-leadership philosophical model. This is an exploration into the applications of servant-leadership within corporate, non-profit, and educational institutions. The basis for this content analysis is an examination of the cultural context of servant-leadership using the primary material and artifacts. We will address the processes in which the production and institutionalization of the servant-leadership ideology is transmitted and implemented within these organizations using Robert Wuthnow's cultural analysis theories.",304897034,,Dissertations & Theses," Semler, Terry CroweSemlerCroweTerrySemler, Terry Crowe", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1320973461 , 36650261 , 66569 , 1442404 , 1442404", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304897034?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Servant-leadership.+Shifting+paradigms%2Fempowering+people%3A+A+content+analysis+of+servant-leadership&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Semler%2C+Terry+Crowe&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Destination Italy: Tourism, colonialism, and the modern Italian nation-state, 1861–1947","This dissertation demonstrates that modern mass tourism was a key discourse that created a set of representational and economic practices critical to the making of modern Italy. Since the mid-nineteenth century, Italy's history as a nation-state has been characterized by belatedness, regional fragmentation, and political instability. Both foreign and Italian tourists, however, encountered a culturally unified nation with a heritage of imperial grandeur and artistic patrimony. My dissertation combines historical, literary, and anthropological methodologies to show that tourism allowed for an imagined community powerful enough to overcome modern Italy's fragmented political identity. Part I explores how the political rhetoric of the Risorgimento—Italy's national unification movement in the mid-nineteenth century—paradoxically celebrated and refused the nation-state. At odds are the rhetoric of poiesis, which insists that Italy is something to be made, and the rhetoric of negation, which maintains that Italy can never exist given its regional, social, and linguistic differentiation. Chapter 1 clarifies the origin of a phrase that has been central to Italy's nation-making project: ""With Italy made, [we] must now make the Italians."" The phrase is often attributed to senator Massimo D'Azeglio circa 1866, but recent scholarship has implied that he never uttered it in that form. I trace the permutations of the phrase through the publication history of D'Azeglio's Ricordi , its resurfacing in the writings of Ferdinando Martini at the fin-de-siècle, and finally its re-appropriation by Gabriele D'Annunzio and the fascist government in the 1920s and 1930s. Chapter 2 shows that by the late nineteenth century Italy becomes framed in terms of decline and decadence; it is no longer a nation of growth, progress, and expansion, but rather one defined by difference and backwardness. I reveal how semantic shifts in concepts such as ""patria"" and ""nation"" from the late Renaissance through the Risorgimento evolved into the rhetoric of negation, which continues to punctuate contemporary political debates about modern Italy. Part II shows how the practices of mass tourism in the nineteenth century by foreigners and Italians alike conditioned a cohesive imagined community that challenged the unstable political conceptions of the nation-state. Chapter 3 details the arrival of modern mass tourism on the Italian peninsula in 1864. It first considers the forms of proto-tourism—pilgrimage, commerce, and the Grand Tour—that foreshadowed the itineraries and practices of later ""mass tourists."" The last half of the chapter explores the role of British tour operator Thomas Cook in establishing a tourism industry in Italy, and consequently, how Cook and his tourists encouraged and accelerated Italian national unification. Chapter 4 explores the development of an organized Italian domestic tourism industry, beginning in 1894 with the founding of the Touring Club Italiano (TCI). I show how the patriotic aims of the TCI laid the foundation for the state organization of tourism circa 1920 and eventually, its manipulation by Mussolini's regime to advance fascist agendas. In Part III, I explore the transition from nation to empire with Italian tourists traveling to their colonies in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly to Rhodes and Libya. Here, Italian tourists encountered an incongruous ""Italy"": one that was simultaneously their own modern, powerful, fascist nation-state and an exotic, primitive, unconquerable Other. I find that tourism conditioned Italy's imperialist project, and in each site, it presaged the transnational flows of globalization. Chapter 5 details the development of the Italian tourism industry on Rhodes, the capital of Dodecanese Islands, and specifies the representations and practices that constructed an ""Italian Rhodes."" It shows how the idea of ""mare nostrum"" and its link to former empires—Rome, Venice, and Christianity—shaped Italy's imperial attitude. Similarly, Chapter 6 explores the representations, and to some extent, the practices of Italian colonial tourism in Libya. Libya was the locus for Italian imperialism, which was simultaneously oriented toward the past, ancient Rome, and the future, Mussolini's fascist Empire. Tourists perpetuated the syncretisms inherent in colonial rule, bringing the colony home with their postcards and narratives. At the same time, these tourists embedded ""Italy"" into a system of cultural flows and asymmetries of power characteristic of a new global order, or, another form of ""Empire.""",304899802,,Dissertations & Theses," Cary, Stephanie HomCaryHomStephanieCary, Stephanie Hom", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1500087251 , 37778011 , 66569 , 9780549534518 , 3306083 , 3306083", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549534518, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304899802?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history"," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history"," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history",," 0298 Literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history"," Literature , Romance literature , European history"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Colonialism , Colonialism-Italy , Imperialism-Italy , Italian tourism , Libya , Nation-state , Nationalism , Rhodes , Touring Club Italiano , Tourism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Destination+Italy%3A+Tourism%2C+colonialism%2C+and+the+modern+Italian+nation-state%2C+1861%E2%80%931947&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cary%2C+Stephanie+Hom&amp;isbn=9780549534518&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on Make Decision in Reservoir Resettlement Modes based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process,"Reservoir resettlement is an important part for the construction of hydraulic and hydroelectric engineering Project, and is a heavy and organized population movement caused by the construction of dydraulic resource project during the process of development and utilization of water resources. It has non-resource nature, also is a complex system project concern to many aspects, such as society, economy, resource, enviroment, etc. Whether dealing with the resettlement issue properly will be directly related to immigrants living standards and the stability of region even the country, the success or failure of the project construction, the smoothing achievement of constructing harmonious society in our country and the goal of ensuring our people a relatively comfortable life. This paper discussed the scientific decision-making methods of selecting reservoir resttlement modes, and then carried out the empirical studies. Based on the brief analysis of reservoir resettlement characteristics, this paper elaborated the resettlement methods like social security, shareholders dividends and long-term compensation to soilless resettlement for reservoir immigrants, and the methods like nearby or near to agriculture resettlement, local agriculture resettlement and relocation agriculture resettlement to soil resettlement for reservoir immigrants. The paper summarily analized the operation methods, strengths and weaknesses, and the constrains of various resettlement modes. Reservoir resettlement is not only a simple relocation process, but also includes the sustainable development requirements that make the the living of immigrants meet or exceed their original level. Therefore, combined with sustainable development theory and reservoir resettlement theory, this paper discussed five inffluent factors which affects the selections of the reservoir immigrants resettlement modes, they are society, economy, resource, enviroment and management level. This paper is based on the actual situation that mainly using soil resettlement and combining with other resettlement modes in our country, the resettlement principle of minimize risk and sustainable development, and related policies. It linked up with the Sustainability and Well-being Assesment (SAWA) proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the DSR model (Drive force - State - Response) proposed by Commission on Sustainable Development (DCS), and the sustainable model proposed by Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), and accorded with the IRR model proposed by Prof. Michael M.Cernea, fully considered the risks, impoverishment and reconstruction issues during process of reservoir resettlement, prevented the ten risks mentioned by T. Downing. This paper adopted the methods which combined macroscopic and microcosmic analysis, quantitative and qualitative analysis, builds up the target system of selection of resettlement modes. It built up AHP (The Analytic Hierarchy Process)model, used the expert grade methods of 1-9 scale to obtain judgement matrix, take the identity test on the matrix, and then calculated each matrix, confirmed the hierarchy single rank and hierarchy overall rank.

Its behavior mode makes people ignore the protection of one's own personal secrets, which cause China's personal secrets with long-term traditional culture to lack the location of privacy. In addition, from self-sufficient natural economy and the social structure to the patriarchal clan system family. From the centralization of state power political mode to the spirit of difference quality that agricultural ideology of plough patriarchal clan system of the kindling material quality has caused legal culture. What people ignored to one's own right is safeguarded, who does not know where to begin especially in protecting the right of privacy. What is more, we may pay attention to the people's faint legal consciousness in dense tradition. And founded a state on initial stage the frequent political movement delayed the process of law construction to a certain extent again. The existence consciousness of the right of privacy has been in the state of freezing all the time either. The appearance and history and culture of the country of personal secrets are inseparable, which in close relation with whole consciousness structure of people of a country. However, because China have rigorously enforce the individual rights of meaning ancient time. Certainly, which do not have the most genuine right of privacy either. Through our consciousness review the human development history now, we can say since having social activities of individual people, which have individual privacy, but the result when developing that the real protection of the right of privacy is civilization modern times. It is the result that citizen's societies developed constantly. China is a heavy-population country; it is the guarantee that the society develops normally to protect the personal secrets of every citizen. It is an inexorable trend developed in era, especially the development at a high speed with global economy. The economic individual depends on the network to link up each other more and more. In addition, with the popularizing constantly of Hi-Tech, the network, electronic computer wide application. The development model and the network with unreasonable legal construction, protect citizen's right of privacy of our country to become the task of top priority in the environment of the network. Right of privacy mean natural person one's own personal private business, personal life know, forbid right who others interfere for others by feeling things in the field personal information, etc. The personal secrets of the network mean that citizens private life secret in Internet are not interfered, spied upon illegally by him, personal data information and other resources closely related to personal information are not searched, spied, make public and utilize illegally by him. Network involve mainly by content that personal secrets protect. The individual privacy that should be protected that some information among them belongs to the general meaning, information it belongs to be can have been at others at normal information who way wins, this part of information can be gotten, known, but the information provider can control others' use and get by others in the network. In a word, at present while the network develops rapidly, not only it is convenient to utilize the network to offer all sorts of human, but also want too. We can't deny the superiority of the network because of what the network causes difficult problem. The formulation and development of any technology will all meet the same question, which will need the law to give correct one direction. Maintain the normal development in order of the network. Keep a relatively legal and rational private space on the cyberspace; keep the individual's information of personal secrets. The ones that ensured personal private life are peaceful, protect the personal inner world and are not interfered for any reason by the external world. Guarantee that the personal information is not spread and spread it maybe is illegally, all play a role in can't be underestimate in maintaining common preface good custom of the modern society and stability development. Modern societies governed by law society, however, come and maintain individual privacy not merely one a piece of social morals issues era network through law, It is even more a legal problem needing to receive settlement urgently. Accelerating development of modern information technology is being brought to mankind and improving enormously, the impact that brings to human personal secrets life too, the ones that therefore formed to right of privacy challenge greatly, it behaves in following several mainly: 1. The individual privacy that the network system is caused by itself encroaches right; 2. Utilize resources of the network to encroach on others' personal secrets; 3. The special subject infringes the individual privacy through the means of the network. This text will be described in detail. This text has also introduced the relevant legislation protected to the right of privacy of the network both at home and abroad; there are the relevant regulations of U.S.A., European Union, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, France, and Taiwan of our country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of our country mainly. The legislation of the above-mentioned countries has characteristics each, there are pros and cons each, worth drawing lessons from our country. European Union and Canada legislate and make network collect user personal the behavior standards of information materials by facilitator by government, this is favorable to emergence protecting interests of individual privacy, reduce the unnecessary encroachment of right dispute case. But this kind of mode restriction on the thing that the facilitator of the network collects user's data and the behaviors of personal secrets to put forward certainly, know the enthusiasm of dampening trade development, and the rigid legislation should always be lagged behind in network technology of developing rapidly, so legislation that lag behind want and hinder network the developments of technology and produce sure negative effect to economic development. Depend on the American mode of the independent management of the trades, which has been adopting the relatively loose policy to the development of the network and e-business all the time, help to encourage and bring about an advance in trade, but because there is not compulsory measure legislating to have and ensure the means, it makes the right of privacy of user's personal data unable to get practical protection to know. It is actually conflict that is the benefit of the country that the conflicts of these two kinds of modes study carefully its profound reason. There are close culture background and traditional idea in Japan, Taiwan and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, its the development and protects and prior to our country to network the legislations of right of privacies of technology but development, its legislative course especially basic principles protected to the right of privacy of the network are comparatively perfect, worth drawing lessons from our country too. Any things are the contradiction entities of profit and fraud; the network is as the same. While following the development of the technology of the network and bring the facility to the masses of network users, the drawback of the network is dashed for ward gradually very apparently, a great deal of problems that the network brings demand solving in order to the form that legislate urgently too. But law lag behind development in society always, the stabilities of law make and legislate impossible to surmount era and the developments of society, so the network user's right of personal secrets is encroached on to be difficult to find the awkward situation that relieve of the law to be difficult to avoid. To the fundamentals law of a country, all very important and irreplaceable to protect meanings and about of citizen's right of privacy in constitution. However, have not stipulated the right of privacy, which protects the citizen clearly in the constitution clause of our country, the regulation of the constitution, lacks the effectiveness. The right of privacy is one of department of important composition in the personality right, it is one of the national democracy that behaves too, it is not merely shown as the inside system of a country, and develop and become the civil right of the range of the world gradually. Stipulate the right of privacy, the attention that will embody the law and protects to personality right clearly from the constitution, in addition, rule by law modernly and emphasize it to people's own care day by day and put the protection of people on the space of top prominence, pay attention to the protection of human rights. The right of privacy is the right that the mankind must be required after crossing over the basic rights to subsistence, this is that mankind respects one's own inevitable outcome, is the prerequisite of respecting each other. The constitution is not merely shown as and adjusts the relation between the country and citizen as the achievement of the human civilization, still adjust the relation between the citizen and citizen. Whether the public law or field, or the private law field, the regulation on the constitution has effects, an organic whole should act on. It is an inevitable choice of a constitution to pay attention to right this of mankind itself, so should analyze the constitution status of the right of privacy from several following respects: It make among it is at constitutions clear the citizen one method in right of privacies, leave of our country one a item of independent personality rightness on right of privacy directly through modification constitution the relevant content of private right. Study the theory to speak from the traditional constitution, it when is encroached on, at judicial ways, quote constitution come question that ensure, there is obstacle of the theory directly. We know, the law is the adjustment of certain social relationships, the ruling class makes the purpose of the law, adjust the social relationships of various fields through the law. In general scholar's view, what constitutions are adjusted is a relation between the state power and citizen's right, This kind of social relationships is decided by the nature of the country and basic system, And has embodied the basic value theory and system of adjusting the state power and citizen's right and arrange. Some scholars think too, the use of the constitution must be realized through the political structure reform, but not pass the characteristic of constitution oneself. The administration of justices of constitution operate issue, at value meaning, mean ordinary courts among judicial activities could have been direct and suitable constitution comes to award the dispute by clause. Exchange speech, it is ordinary court in that involve its it the more civil try, whether could carry on the violation of the constitution and examine or quote the issue that the clause of constitutions awards the civil, criminal case directly by the way at the time of the administration and criminal case. So, in the relation of the constitution, the country or the government office is the important participant throughout, the relation not adjusting citizens between individuals. So, when the citizen's fundamental right is encroached on, in theory, it is difficult to quote constitutions and ensure directly. It is to concern our country's one of the important difficult point of construction governed by law of future how to solve this problem correctly, one of the focus question that theory circles have been probed into all the time s that is too. Looking from civil law, protecting citizen's right of privacy has a great deal of defect and insufficient: Indirect qualities who right of privacy protect, and right of privacy protect the scarce operating it nature disguise scattered qualities who right of privacy protect. Should set up the system of protecting citizen's right of privacy in my national law, seen from direction in which the right of privacy protects, the right of privacy is a kind of important private right, the mode that the right of privacy is protected should be altered too, the concrete content that should define the right of privacy and protect, confirm infringing the composition important document of citizen's right of privacy and stipulating the civil liability which infringes citizen's right of privacy clearly, such as stopping encroaching on, making an apology, compensation for damage. In addition, the exemption situation body copy while legislating to the right of privacy of our country touches upon to some extent. At present, our country is being in the economic stage for high development, this basic national conditions have determined that highly developed socialist democracy and construction of the complete socialist legal system still needs constant efforts for it, people's legal accomplishment should still have a series of development to improve all-snidely. A corresponding one is with it, the right consciousness inning the present stage the citizen including right of privacy in the present stage is not still very strong, the current situation of the right of privacy demonstrates the range small with the situation with relatively narrow field. The one that can be affirmed is, with the development of socialist market economy and construction of democratic politics, and the improvement of citizen's cultural dynamics, people's right consciousness will get general enhancement, the right of privacy will become the concern that an important right gets the society too. The right of privacy is one kind of the personality right, which is a closely linked with people's normal life right, it is social civilizations that progress descendant protection of the self-value that realize gradually. Through protecting the right of privacy from the constitution and civil law field, can perfect the personality right system of the citizen of our country, the ones that contribute to the society develop benignly. The network is one virtual world, people are in this virtual space, enjoy more abundant freedom, can carry on more extensive exchange with other users of the network. But the network world is the extension of the realistic society, the person in the true reality that the Internet user of the activity is in the network world, does not have definitely virtual network subjects. Just on the premise of this, the Internet user carries on the activity in the network world, must observe the law of the realistic society too, is contrary to law in the realistic society, infringe the behavior of the rights of privacy of others, implement in the society of the network, form tort equally. The development of Internet breaks through the national boundaries, the questions that are brought on net are that the global various countries must face too. Can't only consider the national conditions of China, if we strengthen the protection of the right of privacy of the network, should pay close attention to legislative trend and legislative trends in the world even more, draw the feasible experience measure from it, and the international standard protected to the right of privacy gradually draws close. Only take precautions against various kinds of questions that may happen actively when just started in the electronic information networking and development, try one's best to make the laws and regulations rationally abundantly, we will not be passive everywhere, there is light prospect of a becoming legal system, rational society too in the network society in the future.",1026574028, 论网络隐私权的法律保护,Dissertations & Theses," Yan, LinYanLinYan, Lin燕林", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2712748551 , 70534492 , 189128 , H242621 , H242621", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 论网络隐私权的法律保护,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026574028?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIH242621 , Social sciences , Network Right of Privacy , The Civil Law Protecting , The Constitution Protecting , 宪法保护 , 民法保护 , 网络隐私",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=By+Network+Right+of+Privacy+Legal+Protection&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yan%2C+Lin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Housing Real Estate Price Research,"Establish gradually along with the socialism market economy system with real estate market gradually active, our country real estate already through become national economy of important pillar industry, the market system tends in perfect, the housing consumption becomes extension the heat order inside the new motive for needing and consumption.

Whether in the East or the West in ancient times, the death penalty has been deeply stamped with the brand of cruelty. Into modern human society, with the spread of Enlightenment, the concepts of human rights and humane no longer remain in the advocacy of progressive thinkers , instead they go to each person's soul and have bring tremendous reform to death penalty. Changes are not only reflected in the implementation of humane death, the strict proceedings and the rationality of crimes that might be sentenced to death, but also in the worldwide wave of abolishing the death penalty. Until 2006 88 countries and regions in the world have clearly abolished the death penalty for all crimes, 11 countries and regions have abolished death penalty for ordinary crimes while only reserve it for military crimes or war-time crimes, at least 30 countries and regions have abolish death penalty practically, that means no death penalty in the past 10 years and a commitment of no death penalty to people or the international community in the future. It has become an irresistible worldwide trend to abolish death penalty or abstain its usage. China and US, the largest developing and developed countries, have both stick to the death penalty though confronting the trend. Why they do so? What causes so? Are there any differences between two countries in legislation and judicature? It would be significant to China’s ongoing reform of death penalty to compare the differences and the reasons behind them. Considering all those factors, the thesis makes a thorough comparison on the history and current situation, the standpoint and rationality, its legislation, judicial restraint and execution of the two countries. Death penalty in US dates back to UK. As a result of legal tradition, in the early times of American colonies certain amount of death penalty crimes are stipulated though the existence of restraint policy. And as the expansion of the colonies, death penalty is favored by colonists. The thoughts of abolishing death penalty started in the continent in the 18th has also inflicted US and many states begun to restrain it, especially after the second world war, the movement of abolition of death penalty flourished in the US as the derivation and development of civil rights movements. And as a result, in the epoch-making case of Furman v. Georgia, it announces that the law and its execution is cruel and abnormal which is against American Constitution. Influenced by the Furman case, states start revise laws to meet the stand of restrain it, and in 1976 the supreme court of US renounced the principle of Constitution. 38 states in US , military and federal government retained death penalty at present, and due to the differences of legislation, the death penalty systems appeared rather diverse. However in general the death penalty systems have something in common, for instance the narrowness of the scope death penalty, its more and more discreet of implementation, the huge difference between south and north, execution far lower than sentencing, and the humane reflection of its execution. In recent several years, new development appears in US death penalty system, new death penalty crimes are stipulated, and suspension of death movement is on its way which seeks suspension of execution although death penalty is not abolished. China has a history of death penalty for several thousand years. The thought of severe punishment is always dominating. Compared with other countries, death penalty in China has changed from cruel to lenient, from savage to civilization. Chinese Communist Party in revolutionary base period stipulated death penalty crimes to maintain social order, but due to peculiar background, especially the influence from mistakes of aggressiveness, death penalty system is not perfect. After the foundation of new China there is no criminal law that stipulates death penalty and judicial activities can only resort to policies of punishing and mercy for quite a long time. China’s first penal code was made in 1979 and it stipulated death penalty system quite thoroughly and took a discreet position over this issue. But as the huge changes occurred in China in the later years, series of criminal law was made and the death penalty crimes had soared since then. 1997 penal code adopted these legislations and raised the requirement of implementation of death penalty. Although huge differences exist between China and US in history, culture and political systems, their attitude to death penalty is same. What influences American stands is the advocacy of public opinions and its unique political systems. Its public opinions not only affected the people-elected policy maker, but also influenced judges and procurators. The reasons behind such public opinions are the high crime rate, the death penalty tradition of the south, the tradition of private punishment, no domination by Nazi and etc. American political systems are unique. The federal government has limited powers and each state has the power of stipulating death penalty independently. Therefore there can be no uniform legislation to abolish death penalty and the only way is through the supreme court’s guidance. And only when public opinions considered the death penalty as cruel and abnormal can death penalty be abolished thoroughly. China’s public opinions also advocate death penalty, and not only the legislator but also judiciary has to take public opinions into consideration which result in the misuse of death penalty. The reasons behind the public opinions are the deterioration of public securities, the profound influence of legal tradition and Familism, the lack of thoughts of enlightenment and etc. Political factors also play an important role. Due to the influences of the thought of severe punishment and the tradition of “severe penalty against disordered society”, the rulers tend to use death penalty confronting with austere social public securities. Moreover, the aggressive left wing thought still exist and one of its result is severe punishment movement which foster the misuse of death penalty. Although the differences of the reasons of public opinions, they should be guided to strictly restraint of death penalty due to the inherent defects of public opinions. As for the crime of death penalty, besides individual state stipulates that the crime of rape the young girl can be imputed death penalty, other states generally stipulate that only the crime of murder in specific condition can be condemned the death penalty. The American federation criminal code has a relatively broad death penalty, besides the crime of murder and other crimes contain homicide, it also includes the crime of spy, treason and selling large amount narcotics and so on, which not contain causing man’s death. But in generally, the death penalty crimes in US are basically controlled in the scope of “the most serious crime”, and conform to the spirit of international convention. Comparing with the US, the crimes of death penalty in China are undoubtedly very broad; many non-violence economic crimes also may be sentenced to death penalty. So China must learn from American and set strictly limit to the crime of death penalty. As for the pattern of death penalty collocate model, US has cancelled the absolutely death penalty while China has still existed this kind of death penalty. All this is unscientific, we must learn from American and amend our legislation. As for the object of death penalty, China and America both forbid to sentence the pregnant woman, the minor and retarded into death penalty at present, which has reflected the contemporary death penalty system ’s civilization and humanity; But US once persisted carries out the death penalty to the minor and retarded for a long time and has received international society's criticism; China and American both have no stipulation of prohibition the death penalty to the senior citizen, which doesn’t conform to the international convention’s spirit, must be performed to improve. On the issue of substitutes measure for death penalty, US’s the lifelong imprisonment without parole system can display a good function in the substitution of death penalty; while China's death penalty substitutes measure lacks scientific, which lies in the set term of imprisonment’s deadline excessively low, on the other hand, the life imprisonment actually jugging term is too short, thus causes the postponed death sentence system also cannot play a effective role. Therefore, China should introduce the life long imprisonment without parole system into criminal law, and simultaneously enhance the fixation imprisonment’s term. One of the significant characteristic of the American’s death penalty system is its legal system, the idea of “due process” is ingrained in US, through strict and effective judicial measure, the death penalty has been limited maximally. The before trial system in the American’s death penalty case is fixed and detailed, which has divided into the accusation, the arrest, the registration, first time appears in court, the preliminary hearing, the prosecution, the indictment approves, the procedure, the choice jury and so on, entrusts many law suits rights to the suspect. The trial program in the American’s death penalty case is extremely characteristic, which has divided into the determines guilt procedure and the punishment discretion procedure. Only after the charge is established in the guilt determination procedure, can the case enter into the punishment discretion. While in the guilt determines procedure, must all the jury members unanimous approve the guilt can the guilt be come into existence. The punishment discretion plot generally revolves to the aggravate plot and the mitigate plot, only in the condition of the aggravated collectively larger than the mitigate plot, can the death penalty be considered to be sentenced. In some judicial area, the discretion of punishment also centers on some specific question such as the accuser’s possible crime again. Regardless in the guilt determines procedure or the punishment discretion procedure, the jury both has the final decision. After the trial program, US has also stipulated the direct appeal system, namely the case will be automatically appeals to the upper level courts. Besides this, there is the procedure of “after the state’s determine guilt” in addition. After exhaust the state’s relief method, the defendant may also apply for the federation’s “habeas corpus” to seek the rescue from the federation’s court. If all these measure was failed, the accused also may apply for the administration’s clemency. all the American’s judicature area has stipulated characteristic clemency system in death penalty, which conforms to the spirit of international convention. In the case proof standard, US implements “beyond reasonable doubt”, only in the case of the charge prove the guilt “beyond reasonable doubt” and has the aggravated plot, can the accuse be sentenced to death penalty. Moreover, the accused is granted to the right of silence in the entire process, and he/she cannot be forced to prove his/her crime by himself/herself. Thus the behavior of torture ceased. In all criminal case including the death penalty case, the accused has the right of obtaining attorney’s help and the poor defendant can free get the attorney’s help. The American various judicatures area has also stipulated the system of guarantee the effective attorney help to the defendant in death penalty, if the defendant thought attorney’s help was invalid, he can appeal for this reason. Compares with US, there are many improvements in Chinese death penalty system. For example, guilt determines procedure and punishment discretion procedure in whole leads into the guilt determine plot and the punishment discretion confuses, the standard of death penalty is slur, the proof standard in death penalty case is too absolute and idealization, the accused does not grant the right of silence and then the torture phenomenon has massively existed, the attorney’s help in death penalty case has poor effect, the clemency system is absent in death penalty ,all this questions causes China cannot control death penalty effectively. Therefore, China must learn from US in the foundation of national condition. Finally is the comparison of Chinese and American’s death penalty execute system. The American judicature area stipulate 5 kinds execute measure including the hanging, the electrocution, the poison gas, the shooting and injects at present. However, with the development of executes humanity, the injection way is accepted by overwhelming majority judicature area and become the most execute way in practice. In addition, all the American judicatures areas allow the criminal to choose specific death penalty execute way. The American death penalty system is filled with the humanities concern, not only forbid publicly to execute in order to maintain the criminal’s dignity, but also allowed the criminal’s family member, friends, defense attorney, the pastor as well as psychological doctor to the scene. China has adopted the shoot way to execute death penalty for a long time, until recently starts to select the injection method. However, the criminal has not the right of choose specific death penalty execute way. Moreover, in the influence of tradition, the Chinese custom to execute death penalty publicly and hope to display death penalty’s deterrent function by this way. In generally, China’s death penalty execute system is still careless and lack the American’s spirit of humanity concern.

Have already controled the related article concerning the business enterprise inner part currently much with the theories inquiry into is lord, but put angle of view in the business enterprise strategic management and usually management movable level of but not much, with the real estate develops the business enterprise for the study of the object then is also little and little.This text with the internal control actual situation of the real estate business enterprise is a lord, making use the fixed amount of control flow chart of the fixed amount, introduce the internal control process of the real estate business enterprise completely and method, to make this text and can be more convenient in practice use and keep the view. The purpose that this text plait write is the latest fulfillment and results that the overall summary business enterprise controls the aspect interiorly, recommending the inner part control toward all real estates business enterprise inside the profession, with the exaltation inner part in the industry control level, guard against the business enterprise risk, insure the safety movement, raise the business enterprise movement efficiency and manage the level, carry out the more and better and economic performance of the real estate business enterprise.This text analyzed domestic and international development and reasons of the internal controls, introducing the current internal control theories, discussed the internal control of the real estate business enterprise, and inquiried into our country internal control of the real estate business enterprise system of development way of thinking, try hard for completely effectively giving to go together the operator to draw lessons from. The sound valid internal control l was see as is a kind of valid method that resolves many latent problems.The people are widespread to think, the inner part control can keep the company in carrying out the profits target and completing the company mission of orbit, and make this risk in the process reduce the least, the customer need and hobbies that make manage the economy and the competition environments that the layer can handle the quick variety and change much, lay equal stress on to construct the future growth lately;Can lift high-efficiency, reduce the risk of the property loss, and contribute to the credibility that insures the financial report and is institutional with regulation of matching.But, to the understanding of the internal control but is"" miscellaneous disorderly have no chapter"" of, because of the purpose different from demanding dissimilarity, people gave"" inner part control"" connotation and targets, these all caused theoretically confusion and the deviation on the actual situation.Though the COSO internal control frame already at be engaged in to set up the effort that the in general use inner part controls the terrace, the result didn't ideal that prepare to think.The people seem to have already for the accountancy become accustomed to talk about the inner part control, though this kind of tendency is taking place the change, controled the theories currently from the essential inner part to see, its visual field is still not enough spacious, still didn't problem that involve the business enterprise inner part to control the deep time, can't still satisfy the business enterprise benefits related's request and the expectation.Therefore, commence from the relation between business enterprise and market, take the system theory as the foundation, with the system analyze method for tool, the whole angle re- examines the internal control of the business enterprise from the business enterprise, as to it's carry on overall, the comprehensive research and analysis, its necessity and importances are obvious. The real estate development industry is a newly arisen industry at the our country, through the development of more than ten years, the real estate develops the industry to have become our country the national economy develop of pay the pillar industry, for our country the city constucted to develop the function that should have with economic development. Can develop healthily for the sake of the business enterprise, the real estate develop the business enterprise and must build up the inner part control to raise to conduct the efficiency.Valid movement of internal control for make, must construct a good control environment, build up a careful and attentive accountancy's system, press the business circulation design valid of inner part control procedure.The real estate business enterprise is because of the single piece of its product, produce the place mobility big, manage to across big etc. of one degree production characteristics, result in its internal control complicated, hard control, business enterprise inner part of the management risk enlargement, this text is to take the currency funds as an example, inquirying into the concerning the real estate business enterprise risk to control the related problem. Though the each nation and organizations lay particular emphasis on to order to have the dissimilarity to the definition of the internal control, all include two basic aspects:Guarantee accountancy's information accurate credibility, the property safety integrity and promote the business enterprise conduct the management.In fact, this also promotes the business enterprise internal control theories and fulfillments develop exactly of two move greatly because of:The business enterprise inner part enhances demand and exteriors of management to audit the demand of open the exhibition.Just point out on its publication so such as American accountant's association:""1, scope and scales of the business enterprise management become very complicated and vast, must make the management depend on the analytical data and reports of a great deal of reflection economic activities;2, the sound inner part controls to contribute to keeping staff member from appear the mistake, reducing occurrence to be unsuited to the possibility of the rules phenomenon;3, audit the section while audit the strict restrict of the expenses, if don't depend on the customer's internal control system, carry on to big and parts of business enterprises the audit so is impossible"".Be showed from this, the western nation practices the reason of the internal control and the result obtain, then protect the safety of the business enterprise property, raise it is thus clear that accuracy of information, enhance the business enterprise management management, and match with the exterior to audit of open the exhibition, also exactly we carry on the modern business enterprise system reform at present need the target for attain urgently. Owing to our country the present condition of the internal control and the international development trend of the internal control, our country the real estate business enterprise should innovation thought, change idea, establishment system, science of internal control to develop the way of thinking, adopt economy, valid development counterplan, further push internal control theories of thorough development, urge the business enterprise inner part the control constuct perfect.Under the condition of new economic, the business enterprise inner part the control also should need occurrence obvious variety, inner part control continuously to carry on creative, the inner part controls the current internationalization problem, also having the national problem, inner part the control should combine the state of the nation and business enterprises physically etc., need the earnest research.The business enterprise especially big business enterprise inner part control should pay attention to and carry out the business enterprise resources plan, should pay attention to and adapt the demand of the electronic commerce development, should pay attention to the change and innovations of the idea, under the condition of new economic, predominate the business enterprise development and social progressive powers to have already not been decided by the visible resources, but even be decided by the business enterprise and can own and control the invisible resources.Our country business enterprise not only want active to new economy study, still should to in the world advanced business enterprise study.The inner part control even should have the global economy consciousness, wanting the ability sensitive ground value that knows each kind of new-born thing, such as the brand of value, the area of value, Internet of value, the living creature engineering of value, technical and worth etc. The internal control should be a long-term work of the business enterprise, is also the work demands the continuously perfect and improve, must take into backlog continuously in production of business, the enterprise conduct process, perfect, try hard for the establishment to the rise ,the inner- controlled the system of a business, the enterprise that has the Chinese special features, can make the business enterprise of our country occupied in the economy of the world .",1026781360, 房地产企业内部控制研究,Dissertations & Theses," Xu, PingXuPingXu, Ping许萍", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713983751 , 70534392 , 189128 , H360305 , H360305", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 房地产企业内部控制研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026781360?accountid=14496, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting,, 0272 Accounting, Accounting," (UMI)AAIH360305 , Social sciences , The internal control , The real estate business enterprise , risk , 内部控制 , 房地产 , 风险",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+internal+control+research+of+the+real+estate+business+enterprise&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xu%2C+Ping&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The History of Journalism and its Modernization in the Beijing Time,"The freedom of the press was relatively free in the duration of Beiyang governance in Chinese journalism history, although this kind of freedom resulted from the government's weakness and incompetence both at home and abroad. The categories of news media were various at this time. Besides newspaper and periodical still as the principle parts, the news agency started to move towards the professional path, the broadcasting station also was born, as well as the internal operation of journalism industry displayed the prosperity and progress despite of the imbalance development within the industry. The foreword mainly elaborated the background and significance of the topic, the literature review, the research scope, the limitation of partial concepts, the research method as well as the innovation and insufficiency of the paper. The 1st chapter summarizes the political, economic, ideological and cultural condition in the duration of Beiyang governance. The paper strives to discover the background resources with direct relation between the environment and the journalism industry when describing the media external ecological social environment, not adopting the traditional descriptive research method. Due to the weakness of the central government and the confronting balance of local government, the media environment was relatively loose, and there were not any laws to regulate the journalism industry, plus deprived of jurisdiction right in the concession area, all of these factors provided protection for the development of journalism macroscopically. During the 1st World War, China’s national capital force was emerging, progress was made by the railway and posting system, population increase and education improvement, liberation on the thinking and revolution of Chinese literature also provided rare and proper external environment for the development of journalism industry. However, the publishing machinery and papermaking industry were still weak; the government paid a big purchase on such steps and made a great loss for the journalism industry. Nevertheless, under such macro-environment, the categories of newspaper varied, quantity increased, and circulation volume tended to increase and national journalism network came into being. The 2nd chapter elaborated the burgeoning condition of the national official newspaper at this time. After the founding of Minguo China, the national official newspaper were prosperously developed, not only categories varied and the ministries also established internal journals, but also the official newspaper started to break away from folk journalism’s running model, became a kind of authoritative publications releasing national laws and regulations with initial characteristics. After summarized the principle developing history of national official newspaper, the characteristics of its managing system and function features, the paper made an emphasis on introducing some central official newspapers and important local official newspapers under different governance nationwide. The 3rd chapter was on the Party newspapers. The paper analyzed the other important branch newspaper published by the Communist Party of China and Kuomintang respectively. The author held the opinion that the core research value was that how the newspapers were ran, managed and employed by the party. The paper emphasized the internal operation of such newspapers. The KMT put most effort on the battles at that time, the founding and organization of its propaganda ministry experienced a path from lacking of emphasis to become important, and the directional struggle causing from the propaganda ministry also displayed the fierce level of disputes within KMT itself. Thus the party newspapers were relatively disorder at this stage, each newspaper only earn for itself, the control of KMT to such newspapers relied most on the allowances distribution. After the corporation between KMT and CPC, with the help of CPC, KMT’s administrative agency began to manage and regulate journalism effectively, worked out the guidelines for propaganda activities. Since the birth of its own journalism, CPC displayed strong characteristics of strict discipline and management consciousness, besides this, then CPC was a branch of the International Communist Unity, both the Soviet Communist Party and the International Communist Unity gave directions and support to the publication of CPC, the ideological journalism concept of CPC thereby came into being. The paper also introduced important publications of both parties according to their birth time. The 4th chapter was on commercial newspaper. The core research value of the commercial publication was that how they ran, managed and became enterprises. This chapter used another research method because the following chapters would elaborate this chapter’s questions respectively, that was China’s commercial newspapers displayed obvious diversity in different locations, due to the imbalance of economic development and differences of cultural tradition in different areas. During this time, the commercial newspaper in Shanghai was relatively developed, and then Tianjin and the country’s north area and southeast coastal cities, as the political centre, however, the commercial newspaper in Beijing developed slowly. The paper introduced important commercial newspapers according to the location and highlighted their features on the operating model and culture characteristics. The 5th chapter is on religious newspaper. This kind of publication’s intention was to preach religion, therefore their operation and management were not the core research value, the paper implied quantitative and qualitative analysis methods simultaneously to display their basic developing condition at that time. The paper concluded that Catholic and Christian publication were spread comparatively widely through analysis, some of them specialized preaching religious doctrines and totally made it as the principle, others of them were more social and popular and occupying a more widely circulation. There were also censoring system to this kind of religious publication especially by Catholic preaching organs. The publication of Buddhism was also prosperous at the early period of Minguo, coincided with China’s Buddhism Innovation and Saving-Country Movement, many publications on Buddhism appeared, although most of them were short-live, the most important publication on Buddhism also born at this time. As for the Taoism, Confucianism and Muslim, there were publications founded by these religions respectively. The paper also made introduction about them. The 6th chapter was on news agency and broadcasting station. The paper paid attention to the China’s important local news agency at that time, because the international news agency almost monopolized China’s report to the outside world at that time, the appeal for establishing China’s own news agency was strong. Due to lack of techniques, funding and realization, most of the important news agencies were local ones within the country. As on the professional level, they could not compete with the international agency. The paper made introductions about the important news agencies and their operation. The broadcasting station also founded by the foreigners, however, national broadcasting station appeared rapidly, at these stations’ early developing stage, they were not featured with news reporting but music and entertainment parts etc, likewise their profitability mainly relied on selling radio machines and other electronic products. The 7th chapter was on the modernization of journalism industry. Words ever said by Mcluhan: Media is technique. Without support of techniques, it is impossible for the journalism industry modernized. However, modernization cannot be built all over the night; there are different criterions in different developing periods. At the early time of Minguo, the modernization on the news media mostly displayed on the buildings started to be built by few newspaper owners, but less set up internal department collecting and sorting news resources. Communication techniques such as cable and telephone were started to be used, though there were disputes on charging system between the newspaper office and the government, negotiation made by them for a few times. Big news office started to utilize developed rotating printing machine worldwide, and national produced printing machine began to be adopted and accepted by the whole journalism industry, and more news office only rent the printing factory’s machine to publish newspaper, besides funding and technique, the realization also hindered the modernization as far as the journalism industry concerned. The 8th chapter was on the modernization of the operating model of journalism industry. Shareholding system began to become the principle operating model for the news office. As on the internal organization, professional division of labor conforming to modern journalism operation appeared, departments of reporting, editing, operating and managing separated respectively, the coordinating department began to be adopted for more efficient news reporting, circulation and advertisement gains. As on the human resources, occupational journalists appeared, however, full-time and high-qualified journalists’ inadequacy displayed its underdeveloped condition at that time. Comparatively mature and complete regulations on the staff’s treatment such as wages and benefits also appeared. On the whole, the operating model displayed diversity and imbalance features due to news office’s development, regional culture and economic developing level etc. The 9th chapter was on the modernization on management of journalism industry. The paper mainly focused on funding, circulation and advertisement. Influenced by the whole developing level of journalism industry, many news media ever supported with financial assistance by the government and party. As on the circulation, the journalism industry in Southern area restricted by newspaper dealers, a few famous newspapers set low price compared with the cost and mainly relied on the advertisement gains; there were a little bit better in the Northern area due to less pages and income on the circulation; the news office usually adopted self-circulating way or set branch selling office on non-local circulation. The 10th chapter elaborated the modernization of journalism practice. There were more channels collecting news, although still not getting rid of the high dependence of external resources, the percentage of self-collecting news still relatively low, news types were comparatively comprehensive, certain standard began to be set for the news writing, significant improvement got on both the quantity and quality of the newspaper, emerged a few famous journalists such as ShaoPiaoping specializing in news reporting and writing. As on the comments, not only more types, but also featured on the timely affairs. The separated editing method was replaced by the integrated one on the page lay outing; well-chosen concepts became the model for the editors to copy and learn. However, the whole relatively low quality, prevalence of fake news, use of the classical Chinese on most newspapers were the shortcomings for the modernization of journalism practice The 11th chapter was on the modernization of journalism theory and concept. The recognition on the concept and function of newspaper improved significantly and professionally within the industry, comparatively conscious realization on the industry’s status quo came into being, politically-independent, freedom of expression and economically-independent aspects were be regarded as the most important quality for the newspaper itself. The principle of “Intellectuals Commenting Politics” was adopted by many newspapers and became an important part for this time’s journalism theory. Especially the philosophy of “4-Don’ts” addressed by Xinji《DaGongBao》established in Tianjin and its successful practice of this philosophy made the principle become mature at this time. Besides, the tendency of professionalism appeared within the industry and made some statement about how to protect news sources, commerciality and copyright of news. Due to the tumultuous governance of Beiyang governance and turbulent social condition, the appeal on the freedom of news media was strong as a whole industry and adopted many measures to strive for it, at the same time, higher standard on the professional ethics for the journalists and editors required, although few qualified. Journalism groups, research groups and groups within the industry also developed from nationwide to locally.",1026781634, 北洋政府时期的新闻业及其现代化（1916-1928）,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Ze RunWangRunZeWang, Ze Run王润泽", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713984571 , 70560932 , 189128 , H358212 , H358212", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 北洋政府时期的新闻业及其现代化（1916-1928）,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026781634?accountid=14496, 0391 Journalism, 0391 Journalism, 0391 Journalism,, 0391 Journalism, Journalism," (UMI)AAIH358212 , Communication and the arts , Beiyang Government , journalism industry , modernization , 北洋政府 , 新闻业 , 现代化",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+History+of+Journalism+and+its+Modernization+in+the+Beijing+Time&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Ze+Run&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on the Law Governing the Development of Advanced Productive Forces,"Advanced productive forces refer to the strongest abilities to solve the contradictions between human and nature, human and society and among humans in established time and space. They follow and represent the laws on development of human society from lower to higher stages, and also represent the highest level of human seeking perfect combination of the true, the good and the beautiful in its production activities. Advanced productive forces are implemented by advanced laborers and generally have clear and advanced instruments of production as symbols of their existence. Contrasted with general and backward productive forces, advanced productive forces have their own specificity besides the universality of general productive forces. Seen from their position and role in the productive system, advanced productive forces have characteristics of pilot and creation; seen from their function, they have distinct people-first value orientation; seen from their developing level and trend, they have characters of high efficiency and revolutionary. The development course of advanced productive forces is complicated and volatile, and lots of aspects are involved in the motive basis of their birth and growth, which is different according to time, space and country. The motive basis of the birth and development of advanced productive forces, however, can be come down to three aspects, which are technical, institutional and structural basis respectively. First, science and technology leads and impulse the birth and growth of advanced productive forces. The systems of technological innovation, shift from scientific technology to advanced productive forces, check and balance of the contradictions in the operation of the scientific technology, and personnel resources, which are linked to each other, are specific contents and realizing steps; second, as the motive force of the birth and growth of advanced productive forces, institution creativity has such functions as clearing the way for the birth of advanced productive forces, providing guaranty for the development of advanced productive forces, and influencing and regulating the value direction of the development of advanced productive forces. Third, advanced productive forces is a complicated and giant system with various internal elements interacting and cooperating with each other, meanwhile harmoniously developing with the external integrated environment, which includes such aspects as politics, economy and nature. The condition of the elements of productive forces harmoniously combining and collocating with each other, the harmonious allocation model of the macrostructure of productive forces, and the advantage brought by the integrated harmony of the external environment of productive forces, which refer to the integrated advantage of various elements such as nature, economy, society, labor, ecology and institution, is both the motive basis of the birth of advanced productive forces and important guaranty of the healthy and stable growth of advanced productive forces. In practice, advanced productive forces have external manifestation, which means advanced productive forces always progress in certain time and space. Seen from time series, advanced productive forces appear as vertical growth, which means such upgrading movement of advanced productive forces in time series as inoculation, birth, growth, maturity and regeneration caused by such elements as scientific-technical progress, social need, political revolution, and process improvement in certain space; seen from the space connection, advanced productive forces appear as transversal flow, which means the process in which advanced productive forces expand in quantity and evolve in quality with the change of space in certain time, and thus display certain congestion, transition and layout in space. The vertical growth and transversal flow of advanced productive forces are the two basic forms of the development of advanced productive forces, which control, act and accelerate each other and motivate advanced productive forces to grow in flow and flow in growth. The process of combined action appears as an interaction course between advanced productive forces and the other components of the productive system, i.e., non-advanced productive forces. By inheriting and innovating, merging and absorbing, and reforming and sublating the non-advanced productive forces, advanced productive forces realize their own development and promote the level of the whole productive forces of human society. On the whole, the birth and development of advanced productive forces is a spiraling course of the negation of negation. Advanced productive forces of every generation are all breakthrough and innovation based on those of the past generation. The advanced productive forces in the period of industrial civilization, i.e. traditional industrial productive forces, once made outstanding contributions to the development of human society, but due to the evolution of its own contradictions and the change of the core of the development of the times, traditional industrial productive forces are faced with a series of serious obstacles and bottleneck in our era. In present era, we must survey and judge the scientific connotation of advanced productive forces with brand new view and scientific approach of development to develop advanced productive forces in human society, that is to say, we should break through the mentality of resting on the aspect of technical level and short-term production effect, and establish a synthetic, stereoscopic, and comprehensive system of analysis and assessment from the angel of the law governing the whole human ecology and progress of the human civilization. In such a new view, the advanced productive forces of the present era should not be unilaterally accessed with only the quantity concerned, but be comprehensively accessed with both of the quality and quantity concerned, and should be shifted from unary form of satisfying the material requisite to plural form of satisfying the requisite of ecology, material and spirit, and from one-dimensional conquest from to double-dimensional harmony form. Therefore, the advanced productive forces of the present era come into being and develop with advanced science and technology as their material basis, meeting the human’s real demand as their value orientation, and sustainable development as their basic criterion. Assessing the display form of the advanced productive forces of the present era in such a completely new view and grading scale, we can find that among the various forms of the advanced productive forces of the present era, information, culture, and ecology productive forces are the most three representative ones. The birth and growth of the three forms of advanced productive forces is a fundamental revolution to the traditional industrial productive forces. Their birth and growth not only motivates the production system to greatly change and the social economy to grow forward, but also deeply influence the political and cultural life of the society, and even the living style of the human, thus bring great changes to the whole human society. To every country of the present era, it is a strategic mission to develop the three forms of advanced productive forces. To some developing countries, however, industrialization has not been completed yet and more advanced forms of productive forces are needed to be developed with the world’s advanced productive forces as a reference system, therefore most of the countries are faced with the double mission of developing productive forces. Leapfrog development is an effective way for these countries to quickly catch up with the developed countries. After the world history came into being, lots of developing countries began a campaign of catching up the world’s powerful countries of advanced productive forces, among which there is no lack of successful cases of leapfrog development. For example, during the period of the first industrial revolution, the United Kingdom was vaulted from an ordinary island country to the world’s factory through leapfrog development of productive forces; during the period of the second industrial revolution, Germany and the United States realized their position of powerful country in economy, science and technology through leapfrog development of productive forces. The implementation of leapfrog development of productive forces, however, depends on the combined action of various aspects, such as strong support of the government and basic institutional improvement, open market economy system, necessary preparation of manpower and material, and close relationship among the technology centre abroad and at home, meanwhile the principles of growth at an appropriate speed, coordinated development, approach with domestic characteristics, and priority to efficiency with due consideration to fairness are required to be followed. In the course of implementing leapfrog development of productive forces, there are various possible approaches, among which the most representative three ones are imitating innovation, transplanting innovation, and integrating innovation. Every country can choose different approach of leapfrog development of productive forces according to their own natural talents and environmental conditions. In today’s China, the development of advanced productive forces must be established on the most two crucial bases, that is, clearly mastering the developing level and state of the advanced productive forces in the world today and deeply understanding the whole status of development of the productive forces in China today. The former is the basic point of departure and the latter the essential and long-standing factor of the development of the advanced productive forces in China. It is necessary to combine the two organically and dialectically to establish the strategic target and supplementing approach of the development of the advanced productive forces in China. Based on the actual condition of the development of productive forces in China today and combined with the changes in environment abroad and at home, such as the springing up of the world’s advanced productive forces, which include information, culture and ecology productive forces, adhering to the approach of new type of industrialization is a dialectic and organic combination of global views and China’s actual conditions of the development of productive forces, a correct developing strategy in accordance with the law governing the development of advanced productive forces, and the core content of the implementation of leapfrog development of productive forces. The combination of promoting simultaneously with breakthroughs made in key areas and promoting hierarchically with the precursors stimulating the straggler is an available approach to carry out the new type of industrialization. Promoting simultaneously with breakthroughs made in key areas means adhering to the measure of developing simultaneously both industrialization and informationization, government steering and market promoting, shift in the mode of economic growth and transition of economic system, and developing science and technology and comprehensively vitalizing education at the same time of consolidating the advantages of manufacturing industry; promoting hierarchically with the precursors stimulating the straggler means implementing the strategy of uneven growth with the developed areas stimulating and helping the developing areas, the leading industries stimulating and helping other industries. Promoting simultaneously with breakthroughs made in key areas and promoting hierarchically with the precursors stimulating the straggler are is connected to each other, and is a feasible move to implement the strategy of leapfrog development of productive forces.",1026781656, 先进生产力发展规律研究,Dissertations & Theses," Sun, Fang HaiSunHaiFangSun, Fang Hai孙海芳", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713985961 , 70541282 , 189128 , H358679 , H358679", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 先进生产力发展规律研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026781656?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAIH358679 , Philosophy, religion and theology , advanced productive forces , development law , productive forces , 先进生产力 , 发展规律 , 生产力",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+the+Law+Governing+the+Development+%0Aof+Advanced+Productive+Forces&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sun%2C+Fang+Hai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Rhetoric and Reality of Intellectual Property: A Critical History of Copyrights, Patents, and Trademarks","This thesis offers an historical study on intellectual property laws in the west, particularly in the Anglo-American countries. It does not attempt to reiterate all the events along with the development of intellectual property laws, but seeks to analyze and evaluate the social forces that work behind the development of intellectual property laws over the past several hundred years. The central questions of this thesis are why intellectual property laws (traditionally including copyrights, patents, and trademarks) took place in the west and what forces are pushing forward the development of intellectual property laws. The thesis is divided into five chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 study the origin and development of copyright in early England, the formation and transformation of copyright in the United States, and also discuss the international expansion of copyright system through two case studies: copyright discussions between England and the United States during the 19th century, and intellectual property negotiations between the United States and China in the late 20th century. Chapters 3 and 4 investigate the origin of patent system in Europe, the development of English patent law and its complex relationship with the Industrial Revolution, the anti-patent movement during 1850-1875, the evolution of American patent law, and the rapid expansion of patent law in the late 20th century etc. Chapter 5 traces the early development of trademark protection in Europe, and also offers a comprehensive survey on the transformation of trademark law in the United States in the 20th century. The conclusions of this thesis are as follows: First, intellectual property systems originated from the need of a trade policy to regulate commercial competition after the rise of capitalism. Second, merchants have continuously been the driving force for the birth and development of intellectual property systems, and have also been the major beneficiary of intellectual property protections. The so-called creators such as authors or inventors serve as media for such protections and are only incidental beneficiaries of the intellectual property systems. Third, the nature of intellectual property systems is to create and enforce limited monopolies, and to recognize the right of merchants to monopolize certain trade by restricting competition and regulating the commerce. The involvement and support of the state is the necessary condition for the existence of these intellectual property systems. Fourth, in order to persuade the state and the society to support and to accept the intellectual property systems, merchants employ various rhetorical strategies and construct romantic authors, romantic inventors, and romantic consumers as representations for the intellectual property protections. As a result of rationalizing efforts of the legislations and the court adjudications, such romantic ideas have been fairly accepted by the society and have become the legitimate foundations for the existence of copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Fifth, in the rhetorical discourses authors, inventors, and consumers are represented as subjects of intellectual property laws, but in the real world they often become the objects to be regulated by the intellectual property laws. Also, the unorganized public often becomes the losers in the intellectual property games as they are not able to make sufficiently strong voices in the legislation process and also cannot defeat the wealthy and powerful merchants in the judicial proceedings. Last but not least, to have a better future for intellectual property systems it would be desirable to achieve an optimal balance among creators, merchants, and the public. Conventional wisdom often focuses on the balance between the interests of creators and the public interests, but intentionally or inadvertently ignores the position of merchants in the intellectual property systems. In that sense, the merchants can always hide behind the creators to push forward the expansion of intellectual property protections in the name of creators. As a matter of fact, intellectual property rights, as a bundle of rights, consist of the rights of different holders to control and use certain objects, such as the right of creators for creative use, the right of merchants for commercial use, and the right of the public for private use. The purpose of intellectual property laws should only secure the right of the merchants against unfair competition use to the extent that the right of creators for creative use and the right of the public for private use would not be injured. Based on the survey of a long-span history, this thesis attempts to offer an analysis framework to reveal the common features of copyrights, patents, and trademarks, and also to provide reasonable interpretations for various problems asscoiated with the development of intellectual property laws. In addition, this thesis also offers a new perspective to understand the operation of the capitalist system as well as the social forces working behind the development of general legal rules.",1026869026, 知识产权的表达与实践：版权、专利与商标的历史考察,Dissertations & Theses," Huang, Feng HaiHuangHaiFengHuang, Feng Hai黄海峰", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714626621 , 70534492 , 189128 , H345774 , H345774", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 知识产权的表达与实践：版权、专利与商标的历史考察,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026869026?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIH345774 , Social sciences , copyright , history , intellectual property , patent , trademark , 专利 , 历史 , 商标 , 版权 , 知识产权",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Rhetoric+and+Reality+of+Intellectual+Property%3A%0AA+Critical+History+of+Copyrights%2C+Patents%2C+and+Trademarks&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huang%2C+Feng+Hai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Analysis of Chinese Mass Culture,"Mass Culture, which has another name called popular culture or populace culture, is a social culture phenomenon appearing in the process of urbanization and industrialization, and a tendency to develop culture directly being associated with Consumer Society. As forming the factor intricately, the range in the ascendant, popular of development trend involves the global new-type culture form, mass culture has already caused the extensive concern of Chinese and foreign scholars, The studying about it has already been launched in different disciplines, research of different angles and different aspects. Though the academia does not have a final conclusion to the essential intension of mass culture, yet at present there are different judgments on its social functions, and opinions vary to its development prospects. But, urgent need and historical mission of the socialist spiritual civilization developed on the basis of Chinese nation's advanced culture, there are positive theory and practice meanings in the analysis of the mass culture phenomenon to the contemporary Chinese society. In the western society, mass culture is not merely regarded as a kind of cultural life style dominated by culture industry, controlled for the commercial profit by cultural industry, and is often considered to be the cultural activity form set against with elite's culture and elegance culture. The western scholars hold the attitude of a kind of criticism to mass culture generally, among them regard criticism of the school of Frankfort as representatives particularly. The so-called "" mass culture "" of school of Frankfort, is the mass culture in the passive meaning, mainly refers in particular to depend on mass media technology, depend on living of the family and leisure, "" culture mixed sweetmeat "" that agitated the appreciation of art, politics , religious propaganda , philosophy idea and commercial profit , it is the mixtures of science and technology , economic base , ideology and cultural consumption, it is the important component or displaying the way in a totally new way of the modern capitalist commodity system. It has a partiality for the way concept and psychology of handling the masses of amusement with the leisure, cultivates and supports the consciousness of submitting to which rules, safeguards the current situation. Must is it say Frankfort society of school criticize theory point to the contemporary capitalist society mainly to come, it is a kind of culture to the developed industrial society in the west that is explained and criticized with culture. Undoubtedly, this kind of criticism is extremely deep, for us ,have reference function on analyzing contemporary Chinese mass culture scientifically. There are essential differences between Chinese mass culture and western mass culture. Chinese mass culture is after reform and opening-up, with the overall transition of the social structure of our country and brand-new culture phenomenon appearing in sound development of market economy, have extremely deep traditional culture inside information and extremely clear advanced cultural direction at the same time. According to Chinese great mission and essential request that Chinese culture develop of revival of nationhood, Chinese mass culture should be participated in and accepted voluntarily actively by most members of society of our country, have national characters ,accord with spirit of the times , rich science intension , for masses' culture life design loved by all, it must have a national characteristic , scientific and three major characteristics of popularization concurrently at the same time , must reflect it under the socialist market economy condition accurately , the practical experience of life and realizing in life of most members of Chinese society, meet the various demands for the culture life of the people to the greatest extent, and play a positive role to political democracy , economic development and culture prosperity of our country finally. But on the other hand, because contemporary mass culture of China begin to be right away influenced by western mass culture colonialism to sprout, in addition, of our country social cultural dynamics of member is it improve to demand urgently, advanced development and construction of the spiritual civilization of culture also face a series of problems and challenges, so, some unhealthy symptoms and troubling situation have appeared in contemporary Chinese mass culture, live a great deal of field take place passive negative function already , can't adopt a casual attitude already to potential harmfulness its in society, can't act with undue haste. Chinese mass culture, has already inherited Chinese nation's outstanding cultural tradition , infected with the bad habits and acquired characteristics of western mass culture too, thus make the behavior characteristic of Chinese mass culture have dual natures. On one hand, Chinese mass culture has front characteristics , such as national characteristic , science and popularization ,etc., on the other hand, negative characteristics , such as commerciality , level and homogeneity with western mass culture too ,etc., demonstrate a kind of mixing and contradiction on the whole. This text passes the folk culture to the ancient times with appearing in history of people's culture, the new culture of period of the May Fourth Movement , citizen of old Shanghai of 1930s culture, and the comparing vertically of culture form, such as revolutionary popular Volkswagen literature and art,etc. before and after founding the state, have announced that they are in the popular and masses inherent consistency of culture, reveal them in nature and enormous difference functionally too at the same time . Through compare to people's culture and national ideology culture , crosswise of culture , elite of intellectual, have announced the independent character of people's culture development. Elites of people's culture, national ideology culture, intellectual culture, they are as three kinds of different culture forms existing extensively in the present society of our country, have represented three kinds of different meanings and pointed to the cultural function different from three kinds separately, complement each other, restrict each other between the three, form whole pattern of socialist culture of our country together. Chinese mass culture is regarded as a whole important component of culture with Chinese characteristics, itself including national , scientific , mass value pursue , have positive social functions inside, play a positive role to political democracy , economic development and culture prosperity of our country; But at the same time , because receive the western adverse effect of colonizing the effect of mass culture, in addition, the cultural dynamics of social members of our country is limited, thus aggravated the negative effects in social life of Chinese mass culture ,either. In general terms, the social function of contemporary Chinese mass culture demonstrates the contradiction characteristic conflicting each other ,too: In economic field, Chinese mass culture encouraged the Mormonism behavior while bringing about an advance in productivity; In the political field, Chinese mass culture clears up national ideology too while promoting national democratic politics construction; In the field of culture, It has also connived at cultural hegemony while promoting culture to share . Setting up the mass culture with Chinese characteristics, must adhere to three major principles: That is nationality, scientific and popularization. So-called national characteristic, it is development of culture that should inherit and develop Chinese nation outstanding cultural tradition and revolutionary cultural tradition, make great efforts to reflect modern life styles of the people, modern mode of thinking, modern behavior standard , modern morals sentiment , modern aesthetic temperament and interest , modern to conduct oneself in society attitude and modern prevailing custom; Meanwhile, culture should meet the needs of the world , put the cultural development of our country in great background of world culture development, absorb the outstanding cultural quintessence of the various nationalities in the world, with the independent open psychology , reject all its dresses unfavorable to the human development, learn wildly from other's strong points , is used by me. In short, keep not only keep one's own national characters but also and other national equal interchange of culture, realize absorbing each other, common development. What is called scientific, it is development of culture that must insist on scientific spirit that seek truth from facts, insist that the unifying of the theory and practice, will not merely develop rich and colorful philosophy social science and various kinds of literature and art, also should develop the educational culture and science and technology in a more cost-effective manner , with feudalistic superstition ,struggle pseudoscience and moribund ideology and culture firmly, remove culture rubbish constantly, one that is for society overall to offer assurance of ideology and culture while being progressive. What is called popularization, it is construction and development of culture that must regard vastest the people as starting point and home order, make culture become reflection that the people build great practice of socialist modernization, serve the people, educational people, enjoyed by the people conversely, thus make the people improve one's own thought cultural dynamics and level of science and culture constantly, become the new generation of people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education and a strong sense of discipline. Make great efforts to guide the positive factor of mass culture, criticize its negative factor in a more cost-effective manner, the ones that criticized built the rational form of future which constructs the mass culture of implicit national characteristic, scientific and popular characteristic, it is the great subject for research that Chinese mass culture puts forward to us. This text put forward criticize is it construct people's culture with Chinese characteristics get some countermeasures out of to build tentatively. Countermeasures these are it build constructing from macroscopic and microcosmic two level to China people's culture rationally to launch. On the microscopically level, mainly strengthen the humanity to mass culture of elite's culture to promote. We can say, all drawbacks of mass culture, its lies in the disappearance of humane spirit a bit more thoroughly. Dispel all sorts of drawbacks of people's culture, set up the healthy and progressive people's culture with Chinese characteristics, must inject humane spirit into people's culture. Humane spirit human reason appearing in value, to assemble on whole human inherent soul of culture life, it regards pursuing to the lofty value ideal of truth, good and beauty as the core, regards people's own development in an all-round way as the ultimate purpose. Practice has proved carry on humane promotion of spirit to people's culture, to dispel people's culture effective way of drawback. On the micro level, rely on national guide and concrete legal norm and various kinds of cultural policies that country make of ideology strengthen the production to people's culture mainly, circulation, consume all basin manage and standardize. Through promote government norm in microcosmic to humanity of macroscopic, people's culture of China ,, dispel its negative factor as much as possible , really builds and constructs meeting most social member's culture life's needs and people's culture with Chinese characteristics, it will be a great social subject that will be showing especially constantly in field of practice and theory . This text just elementary to get several countermeasure out of, the social subject await further promotion research.",1026880162, 中国大众文化分析,Dissertations & Theses," Niu, Wei JunNiuJunWeiNiu, Wei Jun牛俊伟", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714627161 , 70541282 , 189128 , H398560 , H398560", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国大众文化分析,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026880162?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAIH398560 , Philosophy, religion and theology , Chinese Mass Culture , Nationality , Popularization , Scientific , 中国大众文化 , 大众化 , 民族性 , 科学性",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Analysis+of+Chinese+Mass+Culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Niu%2C+Wei+Jun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Design of Marketing Framework for China PUTIAN Corporation,"CHINA PUTIAN CORPORATION(hereinafter called ""CHINA PUTIAN"") is an IT products and service provider in telecommunication industry. The company was founded in 1980, originally called China Posts and Telecommunications Industry Corporation. It is a state key enterprise directly under the leadership of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC). The company owns CHINA PUTIAN Co., Ltd., which consists of 7 companies: PUTIAN Capitel, PUTIAN Eastcom, Ningbo Electronics, Beijing Ericsson PUTIAN, Nanjing Ericsson Panda, PUTIAN Taili, PUTIAN Designing &amp; Planning Institute for Engineering. Besides that, CHINA PUTIAN also owns over 40 companies directly invested by the headquarters, which include 5 listed companies- Shanghai P&amp;T, Chengdu Cable and Nanjing PUTIAN are directly invested by headquarters; PUTIAN Eastcom and Ningbo Bird are indirectly invested by headquarters. CHINA PUTIAN is a leading one among top 100 enterprises in China's IT industry, and ranked excessively the No. 1 of Top 100 Chinese Electronic &amp; Information Enterprises in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, CHINA PUTIAN ranks No. 1 among the overall listing of China's largest enterprise groups in the manufacture sector of electronic and communication equipments. It ranks No. 5 both in the listings of 500 largest import &amp; export and 200 largest export enterprises issued by the Ministry of Commerce of China. CHINA PUTIAN's business scope covers both fixed and mobile communications. Its available communication equipments and terminal products include: mobile communication network equipments and handsets, optical transmission equipments and communication cables, PDF and connectors, power supplies, microwave communication equipments, telecommunication network Operation Support Systems (OSS), SPC switch, videophones and IC card payphones, PHS handsets, logistics information system and equipments for industries, ITS series products, office information equipments and etc, as well as project contracting home and abroad, international cooperation, technology transfer, products import and export and etc. Since it was born under the planned economy, China Putian gets many serious problem with its marketing framework, such as branches overlapped, overstaffed, half and unclear assignment, faulty merit system, lay much more emphasis upon sales than marketing. CHINA PUTIAN's marketing network includes two networks of market development and after-sales service, which has about 700 relative offices covering almost all the areas above county level in China. CHINA PUTIAN has established 8 representative offices in Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Xi'an. China Putian equips its framework with the marketing department, but the department puts its all force into market scheme and distribution. It’s vague and general, far from real market, unresponsive to the marketing information, lack of essential effort towards marketing. China Putian has a group of subsidiaries who do the market in their own way, and it is lack of management and development over the whole holding market. This seriously stunts China Putian’s growth. In the fast developing industry, China Putian must find a way suitable for itself and went along with the developing direction of the industry. Telecommunication industry will be the largest industry in the world of 21th century, it is the base of modern economy and leader of society development. At the same time, the industry needs knowledge and technique, and provides high percentage of social employment. It can be a continuously developing industry, with low input and high efficiency. But it also hides with high risk, high competition and high investment. In China, telecommunication industry has its own specific character. Considering both the practice of China Putian and the specialty of the industry, the thesis designs a whole framework of marketing for China Putian. It first expatiates the differences between sales and marketing, and the importance of marketing, also introduces the successful experiences of corporations in the industry to set out the importance and bright future for the marketing of China Putian. It has significant influence to set out a suitable marketing framework in a corporation. A corporation’s living base is marketing. So marketing should be given highest attention throughout the corporation, from investment planning, personnel training to the setting up of an effective marketing framework. Thus, China Putian will have an overall marketing structure. The thesis gives a design of marketing frame for China Putian, considering its own features. The marketing frame is formed of seven functional parts. They are government department, align department, partner department, sales communicating department, product developing department, international market developing department and promoting department. The thesis lists their organic system, ruling extension and duties. The departments set up due to different courses: Government department: as a state-owned corporation, China Putian’s products and services may be greatly influenced by government’s policies. It is very important to the corporation to remain good relationship with the government. Being the practicer and witness of the rapid growth of Chinese IT industry at all times, CHINA PUTIAN and its subsidiaries have attracted great attention from national Communist Party of China (CPC) and government leaders. Those leaders' sincere concern and support can be found in the development history of CHINA PUTIAN. Align department: its main assignment are to absorb right personnel, to supplement each other with resources in the industry, to gain a better and healthier environment for the development of the corporation, to promote the develop of the whole industry to gain the scale economy. Under the new market mechanism and the support of friends from all walks of life, CHINA PUTIAN will establish good cooperation relationships with all major telecommunication carriers in China by resorting to its own technical merit and industrial capacity. Partner department: it’s a channel cleaner between the corporation and final market, to make the channel expedite and healthy, to organize its affiliated enterprises to undertake important projects of constructing state public and private networks and to provide total solutions for manufacture, design, installation, test, etc. It is important to set up an information-sharing channel for innovators and potential partners working in academia or the business world, aiming to promote cooperation. Now our country is facing a strategic period and it's also a vital one for the development of IT industry. CHINA PUTIAN should cooperate with the partner in and out of the industry, to meet government's requirements, carry out reforms proactively, strengthen the integration of group resource, enhance competence and manage to create values for clients, so as to become better, stronger and more stable, and make greater contributions to China's IT industry. Product developing department: it is a vanguard of the corporation’s R&amp;D towards the market demands, and finds new way of developing market, to widen the business of the corporation. CHINA PUTIAN promotes technical innovation and continually consolidats its R&amp;D on telecom technologies and products with its independent intellectual property right. CHINA PUTIAN R&amp;D System includes central research institute and its branches. In November 2001, CHINA PUTIAN set up its central research institute-CHINA PUTIAN Institute of Technology and later four branches in Capitel, Eastcom, Runway, and Smartcomm in succession. This central research institute is responsible for the comprehensive management and planning of over 80 PUTIAN's research institutions. In July 2003, CHINA PUTIAN Institute of Technology (Shanghai) was formally in operation. It will provide mobile phone chipset and RF module with own core technologies for PUTIAN Group and deepen terminal R&amp;D in core level. Promotion department: modern marketing strategy aims much more on the reputation of the corporation by have promotion activities toward products related with the looks, characters, purchasing issues and benefits to the customers, etc. And of course all of these promotion should be based on the right products for the aimed customers, in all the aspects of meeting the needs of final customers, went along with the fashion, the trend of the social developing, and pricing attractively. To do the promotion, CHINA PUTIAN shall also contribute its efforts to commonweal affairs to maintain good reputation of the corporation among common people who are also the potential customers, and it has done so gradually. Its donation built a Wazijie Project Hope School in Huanglong County of Shaanxi Province. It donated mobile phones of its own brand to model workers from China's western area. It donated relieving fund to the ""Care for the West, Share One Love"" movement. It signed assistance agreements with 2 poverty-stricken counties-Dari and Gande, in Guoluo Prefecture of Qinghai Province. It donated money and material to Anti-SARS related organization. International marketing department: CHINA PUTIAN is keen on developing international markets. Through joint venture, cooperation, and compensation trade, CHINA PUTIAN has established over 90 joint venture companies with 47 companies including world-renowned telecommunication manufacturers from 19 countries and regions. CHINA PUTIAN enjoys long-term strategic partnership with world-renowned telecommunication manufacturers such as Ericsson, Nokia, Panasonic, Motorola, Alcatel, Toshiba, Sanyo, Lucent, NEC, Corning, Nortel, TI, Tellabs, etc. In 2003, the company's total import and export volume is US$ 4.63 billion. Its export volume is US$ 2.16 billion. Its products are sold in dozens of countries and regions such as the U.S., Japan, Finland, Sweden, the U.K., Turkey, United Arab Emirates, India, Nepal, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Cuba, Columbia and etc. So it is an important part for corporation’s development that to communicate and cooperate with the industry members global wide. PUTIAN should also pay greater attention and resources on cooperation with foreign companies. It is committed to expanding its business scope into promising new areas in communications solutions, products and services at home and aboard. Sales department: it is the final step of marketing, which is a point to verify the effects of the work of marketing. The thesis emphasizes on the functions, extension and merit system of these seven parts, and gives living cases to support the design. These cases illustrate different aspects of the marketing function. The functional departments are not working independently, but connecting a lot. In this way, China Putian’s developing strategy can be laid down to the detailed assignments of marketing. At the same time, the various problems and information can be fed back and solved in time, so that, the strategy itself can be supplemented and corrected. The thesis demonstrates the significance of after-sales services. The holding of customers largely relies on the quality of after-sales services, it’s also a course of gaining goodwill for the organization, so after-sales service is an important and complex function. The thesis also discusses the merit system of after-sales service function, and illustrates the merit system of customer-service department of China Putian Hexin Network Communication Technique Corporation to make it practical to China Putian. The thesis then emphasizes on what should be noticed during the setting up of the framework, like the problem of communication hindrances. The marketing framework will have large investment of the resources, and what’s more, may not get immediate effects. So the leading members of China Putian have to voluntarily demonstrate the importance of the framework, and push forward the work of setting up the framework. Marketing function is the most disputed one among all the functions in the corporation, and the decisions makers are rectify their attitudes towards marketing stage by stage. At first, marketing function is just like other functions of personnel, finance, manufacture, afterwards, going along with the development of the corporation, people gradually realize the importance of marketing, and think it should be more important than other functions, and even the core function of the corporation. No marketing, no corporation. Other people regard that customers are the core of the corporation’s living, marketing is the channel connecting the corporation and the customers. And the regards have been believed throughout the world. But in China’s corporations, there is no way to believe marketing as the core of living, include China Putian. China Putian pays much attention on the volume of sales, on the time of payback. Marketing is just so-so, no one is ready to think high of the marketing function. From the view of the ready marketing framework of China Putian, the subordinate functions are set up according to the assignments of the strategy, some of the assignments are rather duplicated, so it makes cooperation much important. But smooth cooperation is rather difficult to get, it needs a common interest among the subordinate functions. The thesis tries to exercise the marketing theories to analyze the sticking point in the marketing function of China Putian, and finally tries to find a way for it.",1026880954, 中国普天信息产业集团公司市场营销组织设计,Dissertations & Theses," Gao, WeiGaoWeiGao, Wei高伟", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714627511 , 70534552 , 189128 , H392350 , H392350", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国普天信息产业集团公司市场营销组织设计,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026880954?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAIH392350 , Social sciences , Framework , Marketing , 市场营销 , 组织",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Design+of+Marketing+Framework+for+China+PUTIAN+Corporation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gao%2C+Wei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A Comprehensive Study of the Development of the CPC's Democratic Thoughts,"Before the foundation of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter CPC) the Chinese democratic revolution has been occurred. The Chinese revolution has been continued for several decades before CPC has become the major revolution force in Chinese political arena. The Revolution under the leadership of CPC has been the continuation of the Chinese democratic revolution indeed. Therefore, the following characteristic background for the foundation of CPC goes as: firstly, its long period of living in isolation and its serious political corruption have caused the under development of Chinese economy and thus the level of the productive forces for the development of democracy in China is kept really low; secondly, the invasion of the Imperial Powers has robbed China of its sovereignty as well as the independence of the Chinese nation; thirdly, the 1911 Revolution (Xinhaigemin) has overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China, but the newly born Republic of China headed by Jiang Jieshi later has turned into the regime of big landlords and bourgeoisie. It has not paved the way for the development of Chinese National Capitalism, but threw itself into the lap of Imperial Powers to suppress the development of Chinese National Capitalism. The nature of its Class has determined itself to fail to set down the right policy for the classes and politics in China so as to complete an effective political conformity of the Chinese society. Therefore, after the establishment of the Republic of China, the whole country still remains disintegrated, and the Chinese people still live an extremely poor life, let alone their independence and democratic rights in China. In 1917, the October Revolution in Russia won its victory and then it has brought Marxism into China. With its revolutionary and scientific and practical features, the Marxism has been accepted by the progressive intellectuals in China, therefore, CPC has come into being which has been the product of the combination of Marxism and Chinese revolutionary practices. Since its foundation, CPC has been guided by the Marxist proletariat revolutionary thoughts and struggled for the ideal of Communism. CPC has worked out the proletariat revolutionary strategy, adopted the democratic principles of Marxism, established the Marxist Party and Army and led Chinese people to carry on the democratic revolution in China. During the Chinese revolution, with the combination of democratic thoughts of Marxism and the revolutionary practice in China led by CPC, the CPC democratic thoughts have come into being. Thereafter the CPC democratic thoughts have been developing. This dissertation aims at making a comprehensive study of the CPC democratic thoughts in six chapters. Chapter one has discussed the establishment of CPC democratic thoughts. The CPC democratic thoughts set the Marxist democratic thoughts as its core with the background of particular Chinese revolution and rich Chinese Civilization. Therefore, the establishment of CPC democratic thoughts have been influenced by the following three forces: Marxist democratic thoughts, capitalist democratic thoughts, and the Chinese traditional thoughts such as “human-oriented and rule of virtue”. Since the establishment of the CPC democratic thoughts have come into being in the course of democratic revolution, it has presented itself with two features: adopting to conditions of Chinese revolution and responding to the task of the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, China has remained as no independence to the outside and no sovereignty inside, its people has lived in extremely poverty. Just like the famous scholar in Peking University, Prof. Guan Haiting pointed out in his writing, The Review of History of 20th Century Chinese Political Development, as to the Chinese people living in such a poor life, democracy has become a real luxury in their life, the first thing to do for the Chinese people at that time should be conducting the revolution to save the nation in peril, therefore, the Chinese democratic movement often serves as the tool to save the nation in peril and it remains not as its aim at all. That is why we can say that the CPC democratic thoughts have the revolutionary feature from its very beginning. The CPC democratic thoughts has developed with the focus of conducting Chinese revolution and taking the regime for the revolution, and with its aim of capturing the victory of the revolution in China and establishing of the new democratic state. Therefore the CPC democratic thoughts have been embodied as the concrete revolutionary strategy and tactics, such as “the mass line” and “united front”. As to the periods of establishment and development of the CPC democratic thoughts, the period from the foundation of CPC to the victory of new democratic revolution is the most important period for the primary establishment of the CPC democratic thoughts. Chapter two has talked about the development of the CPC democratic thoughts. Before the foundation of the People’s Republic of China, what kind of state-ship and government should be established in China has become an urgent task for CPC. At that time, guided by Marxist thought of Proletariat dictatorship and based on the practical condition of China, the CPC has creatively brought forward the People’s democratic dictatorship which guided the new China to establish the state-ship of the People’s democratic dictatorship and its basic democratic system, and has pave the way for the socialist democratic system in the way of government guarantee. In addition, CPC has guided Chinese people to pass the first basic law, namely, the Constitution in China in 1954. The Constitution has stipulated the state system of the People’s democratic dictatorship in China, the system of government of people’s congress, the basic democratic system of multi –nationality, the system of multi-party co-operation and democratic supervision, and democracy at basic levels. It has also regulated people’s basic democratic rights which has embodied the CPC democracy and democratic legal system thoughts. At the same time, CPC has led people to conduct the economic building and set the first five-year plan and the target of industrial development which has lain a solid base for the establishment of the socialist democratic system and embodied the CPC thought that the productive forces is the base for development of democracy. After foundation of People’s Republic of China (PRC), the state system of People’s democratic dictatorship is of the new democracy. During that period, the public ownership as the dominated position in the national economy has not established, and there are also five kinds of economic forces in the country’s economy which are not of the socialism. Guided by the ideal of the socialist democracy, CPC has renewed national economy and put forward their transition towards the socialist economy. CPC has regulated this transition into the Constitution which is the embodiment of CPC’s building of socialist democracy in China. The transition towards the socialist economy, the CPC democratic thoughts has also developed into the socialist democratic thoughts. After “the Three Great Remould” movements, namely, movements of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, China has established the socialist democracy system and pushed the development of the CPC democratic thoughts into that of the Socialist democracy thoughts. This period has been the period of establishing and developing of CPC socialist democracy and legal system thoughts with its focus of creation of people’s democratic dictatorship, transition towards the socialism, paving the way for building of socialism and making perfect the legal system. Chapter three has focused on the ups and downs of the CPC democratic thoughts. After the completion of “the Three Great Remould” movements, the new system of socialism has been established in China. The development of Chinese democracy and that of the CPC democratic thoughts both have been based on the socialism thereafter. Before and after “the 8th CPC National Congress”, the CPC has made a lot of exploration in the way of how to improve and develop the socialist democracy. The CPC has found more problems and studied more issues. For example,, Mr. Mao Zedong has discussed how to balance the relation between the central government and the local government in his On the Ten Major Relations and on its related discussions. In the field of scientific work, the CPC has adopted the guideline of “letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend”, developed a policy of “long-term co-existence and mutual supervision” with other democratic parties, and formed the thought of “handling correctly the contradictions among the people” and so on. During September 15-27, 1956, the 8th CPC National Congress was held in Beijing which was held with the background of the victory of the socialism and the realization of its fundamental change of social conditions in China. The congress has reflected the status of the every social class and Chinese changes in their political, cultural and economic senses. The congress has summed up the experiences of the People’s democratic dictatorship as well as of constructing the newly socialist democracy. More importantly, the congress was held after the 20th National Congress of Communist Party of the Soviet Union and has discussed the malpractice of the Soviet Union Mode and stressed the issue of the development of democracy and brought forward many thoughts and strategies of constructing the socialist democracy. But due to the pressing economic development and the threat from the international capitalism, due to the unilateralism of developing the economy and due to the influence of the malpractice of the Soviet Union Mode, the “Left” mistakes have occurred in the CPC and the thoughts of the 8th National Congress has been given up in the practice of socialist construction. During the transformation to the socialist construction, the development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been misled and the “Left” thought in CPC has been spread unchecked and prevented the development of the socialist democracy and led to the happening of the tragedy of “Cultural Revolution”. Chapter four has stressed the recovery and the development of the CPC democratic thoughts. The opening of 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the CPC has indicated the ending of the “Left” errors in CPC. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the CPC has resumed the Marxist thought line of “seeking truth from the facts” and renewed the correct thought of how to develop the socialist democratic thoughts around the 8th National Congress of CPC. During the correction of the “Left” errors, CPC has set forth the Four Fundamental Principles (the socialist road, the People’s democratic dictatorship, Marxist-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thoughts and the leadership of the CPC) which guide the construction of the socialist democracy. Along the correct guideline of “seeking the truth from facts”, the CPC has set forth the thoughts of reforming system. As to the economic system, the CPC has brought forward the central task of the economic construction and come back to the road of Marxist idea that “the productive forces have been the base for the development of democracy. Constructing the socialist democracy must be needed to enhance the construction of the legal system and democratic system, and make the democratic system institutionalized and legalized so that to meet the requirement of extending democracy and of constructing the socialist modernization. The CPC has brought forth the thought of reforming the system of cadre leadership which starts to the prologue of reforming the political system. Chapter five has detailed the comprehensive development of the CPC democratic thoughts. On the 12th National Congress of CPC, the CPC has stated the importance of developing democracy from the overall situation of constructing the socialist modernization. The CPC headed By Mr. Deng Xiaoping has changed the modernization development strategy from its unilateralism of developing the economy into the comprehensive one, in other words, modernization in China means not only the modernization of economy, but also the modernization of politics and culture. The CPC has also set forth the task of building our great motherland into a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country. Thereafter the CPC democratic thoughts has finally shook off from its thinking of revolution and stepped into the suitable track of developing the socialist democracy in China, set out the strategy of comprehensive development of the society and has made the democracy as one of the developing target of the whole development of the society. The reforming of the political system has officially brought forward only after the primary success of the economic reforming. With the deepening economic system reform, the former political system has not met the development of economy. In order to liberate the productive forces and shake off the bondage of related superstructure, the 13th National Congress of CPC has stressed the thought of reforming the political system. On the 13th National Congress of CPC, the CPC has stated the thought of reforming the political system in a comprehensive way which is the further advance in developing the CPC democratic thoughts. With the further development of reforming and opening-up, the CPC has continued its exploration in developing the socialism and later the CPC has developed the theory that China was in the primary stage of socialism and the thought of the socialist commodity economy and further developed into forming the new theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Among which building the socialist democratic thoughts with Chinese characteristics has become the advancement of the CPC democratic thoughts. With the guideline of building the socialist democratic thoughts with Chinese characteristics, the CPC has formed its reform thought of political system with the base of “adhering to and improving the socialist democracy system” in its practice of political reforms. With the advancement in legal system construction and publication of democracy, the CPC has developed into the thought of “ruling with law and constructing the socialist legal country”. After the successes in reforms in economic and political systems and with the start of building a well-off society in an all-round way, the CPC has pointed out the new thought of development of political civilization as its democratic thoughts. The development of political civilization has come into being with the development of the times and it is the requirement for the CPC to build a well-off society in an all-round way and it is also the advancement of CPC democratic thoughts. In terms of its contents, the development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been centered on how to reform and improve the basic system of the socialism, and the development stage is its mature period for the CPC democratic thoughts. Chapter six has summed up the path and characteristics of the CPC democratic thoughts. The development of the CPC democratic thoughts has been influenced by many factors, such as social conditions for the economy, people’s education level, people’s knowledge of law, and democratic practice. It is clear that the CPC democratic thoughts have been a combination of many factors. With the influence of these factors, the CPC democratic thoughts have gained their characteristics: people’s democratic dictatorship, socialism, adaptation to the revolution and construction, keeping on developing and so on. In general, the various stages of the CPC democratic thoughts have indicated a progressive course in which the latter stage has advanced with the base of the former. From the revolution period to the socialist construction period, the CPC democratic thoughts have adapted to the requirement of revolution first and then of socialist construction, and experienced the following stages: from the democratic thoughts of the revolutionary party to that of the party in power, from its stress on seizing the victory of the revolution and creating new system to stressing the socialist systematic construction and legal development, from its stressing that democracy should be submitted to the needs of revolution and economic construction to the idea that the democracy construction has become the important part of collective targets of socialist construction. In the part of conclusion, this dissertation has stressed again that the CPC democratic thoughts have been guided by the ideal of communism and developed with the direction of socialist democratic practice, in other words, the CPC democratic thoughts have developed with the direction of communist ideal and also with the direction of socialist practice which reflects that the basic law of Chinese Socialist democracy development led by the CPC, namely, from its ideal to its practice, and again from its practice to its ideal. Therefore, not only from the viewpoint of the CPC democratic thoughts, but also from the practice guided by the CPC democratic thoughts, the ideal is not far from us, our theory could give us strong motivation an push us forwards our ideal; as long as we strive for our ideal with heart and soul, we human beings could step into the glorious future of Communism.",1026881801, 中国共产党民主思想发展研究,Dissertations & Theses," Lu, YiLuYiLu, Yi卢轶", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714658921 , 70534442 , 189128 , H395429 , H395429", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国共产党民主思想发展研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026881801?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH395429 , Social sciences , democratic thoughts , the CCP , 中国共产党 , 民主思想",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Comprehensive+Study+of+the+Development+of+the+CPC%27s+Democratic+Thoughts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lu%2C+Yi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Studies on biological invasion by Eupatorium adenophorum,"Biological invasion has brought about serious loss to social and economic development and exerted heavy impacts on biodiversity, which received great concern in international community. The mechanism for the invasion is the key scientific issue among others. In the paper, we examined the biological, ecological traits and changing in allelopathy of croften weed (Eupatorium adenophorum), and alteration of the soil properties in different habitats to describe the special properties of invasive plants and seek the mechanisms of invader success. Our results indicated that the dominating traits and ecological strategy of E. adenophorum population were different in habitats. Evergreen broadleaved forest is a stress habitat for E.. adenophorum, and it exhibited r- strategy. However, in optimum deciduous broadleaved forest, the E. adenophorum population preferred k- strategy. In stress habitat, the growth of adult individual of E. adenophorum was limited by the resource as light, and with low ability for absorbing and depositing the nutrient, thus they could not produce more clonal individual that need more energy; But in optimum habitat, the adult individual of E. adenophorum grew strongly due to high ability for absorbing and depositing the nutrient, thus they could produce more clonal offsprings. In stress habitats, small numbers of weak adult individuals of the invader played a minor role on the seedling banks; and the populations made good use of the heterogeneous resources by using their abundant seed source. In contrast, in optimum habitat densely and boomingly growing individuals greatly influenced the seedlings resulting in low survival rate of seedlings, the population competed effectively for resources by its abundant clonal seedlings with high growth and competitive features. These two ecological strategies could transform to each other at space and time and facilitate E. adenophorum to establish in extensive habitats. The reproductive characteristics of invasive plants correlate with their invasive ability. For A. adenophorum, populations may reproduce by seed or clonally, its most seedlings occurring in evergreen broadleaved forest, and its many more clonal plants occurring in deciduous broadleaved forest and roadside sites. The litter covering at the soil surface only reduces seedling abundance in the seedling emergence period, and that does not influence the seedling growth after emergence period. The growth and distributing pattern of adult E. adenophorum in different habitat dominated the patterns of A. adenophorum reproduction. In evergreen broadleaved forest, parental plants were sparse and grew weakly, thus the survival rate of seedlings was high. In contrast, in deciduous broadleaved forest and roadside, the parents grew strongly and abundant, thus the survival rate of seedlings was low. That may be because adult A. adenophorum compete strongly for resources (such as nutrient and water) or because such mature plants are toxic to seedlings. The diffusion of A. adenophorum from its original region in Central America to Australia, Africa, Asia and so forth by human movement; Furthermore, the spread of this plant from an ecosystem or habitat to other new ecosystem or habitat could be by seed, via wind, water, or animal-borne transport. Finally, at infested sites, A. adenophorum populations may primarily reproduce and come to dominate a site by clonal reproduction. In evergreen broadleaved forest, the plants rely on seed dispersal to maintain populations in such habitats. In contrast, clonal plants grow quickly and compete strongly; contributing to the creation of monospecific stands particularly may present a substantial barrier to the restoration of natural community in deciduous broadleaved forest and roadside. Allelopathy explained a part of the invasiveness of E. adenophorum. The allelopathy of roots and stems of E. adenophorum were significant difference between habitats. This allelopathy of roots or stems was strong in optimum habitat, however that was weak in stress habitat; the result was significantly related to the abundances of native plants in habitats, showing that the difference of allelopathy in E. adenophorum results in different invasiveness of E. adenophorum between habitats. In optimum habitats, E. adenophorum grown strongly and abundantly, thus they could produce much more allelopathicsubstance in unit area than those grown in stress habitats, which might compel the native plants into more competition pressure and accelerated the natural vegetation declining in the habitat. The properties of soil from E. adenophorum heavily invaded habitat were significantly altered; the content of available N, P, K in heavily invaded habitat were all greatly enhanced than in lightly invaded; and the functional structure of soil microbe community was altered too, the catabolic activity of the soil microbe community at acids was significantly greater, and that at glucide or hydroxyketone was significantly low in heavily invaded habitat than those in lightly invaded. The invasive species might destroy the closely coupled soil-plant communities that developed over time by changing the soil microbial community, and successfully invaded the habitat by inhibiting the growth and regeneration of native plant species. The restoration of the soil microbial community in invaded habitats might be long-term and difficult process. This may be a formidable obstacle to overcome for controlling invasive plants and restoring the vegetation in agricultural and natural ecosystems. Thus, single reason, such as physiological or chemical characteristics of invasive plant, is limited and failed to provide adequate explanations of invader success. A holistic perspective that considers the whole system and the interactions among the components will be a more fruitful approach to understanding invasive ecology. A knowledge of how the invading species replaces the native species is probably the key to the effective management and soil restoration strategies.",1026900705, 紫茎泽兰入侵生态学研究,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, Jun XingYuXingJunYu, Jun Xing于兴军", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2714869791 , 70608602 , 189128 , H383110 , H383110", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 紫茎泽兰入侵生态学研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026900705?accountid=14496, 0309 Plant biology, 0309 Plant biology, 0309 Plant biology,, 0309 Plant biology, Plant biology," (UMI)AAIH383110 , Biological sciences , Biological invasion , Eupatorium adenophorum , allelopathy , invasion mechanism , soil microbe community , 入侵机制 , 化感作用 , 土壤微生物群落 , 外来入侵植物 , 紫茎泽兰",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Studies+on+biological+invasion+by+Eupatorium+adenophorum&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Jun+Xing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Macroscopic Analysis of Chinese fictitious Economy,"Since 80's in 20century, the total financial property of the western and main industrial country and the ratio of the GDP have raised quickly. Because give up gold standard currency is thoroughly fictitious to have already turn behind, the financial property inflated many nations to exceed actual GDP quickly 100% above;The contact of the international was increasingly close, usually the item receipt and expenditure and the capital item receipt and expenditure have already had very big ratio of its GDP.This kind of economy that outruns real economy to enlarge continuously has obvious fictitious , need to use the concept of the fictitious economy thus to it to carry on a research. The finance is more and more important in the modern society, almost becoming the motive source and core of the modern economy, also it is the weak link of development in the perfecting socialism market economy system in China.Be economic to the fictitious of grind Investigate, turn the research and quest of the process to the capital fictitious especially, can provide the operation guide for the contemporary and financial innovation.Study a financial problem from the angle of the fictitious economy, can obtain a kind of more spacious of range of experience, turn deeply with financial system reform to put forward a beneficial suggestion to the finance of China. The quick development of financial liberalism in world, the financial innovation appears continuously, nations of the monetary policy,rate of exchange system,portfolio,crisis management policies all will take place to the realistic economy to influence very greatly, to macro-economy the management put forward a very high request, thus request to have correspond of the policy design and the system thinking. Industrialize a stage after acrossing in succession into along with the flourishing capitalism nation, the economic globalization,capital flows liberalism to make the huge financial capital become a kind of strength of independence in the world, developping its wealth to create the decision intelligence function and carefully evadable its huge impact risk will test the layers of macroeconomics management availably, also providing to the researchers good choose. Fictitious economy conduct and actions is a theories system that is becoming, holding it with accuracy,is contributed to the confidence of the whole modern economic system and comprehending it.Appear that the global economic discharge flow,the property price exist at any time under indetermination circumstance, the pulse that holds economic movement already can't the light seeing actual GDP of how much, or the size of the actual product yield, also need to see a funds fly to with the discharge, sees the motion,variety that the social value measure and distribute. The fictitious economy is a total amount problem, but needs to have numerous weight conduct and actions to prop up in the meantime, because this is at home and abroad all the problem in continuously thorough research, a lot of defines exist faintness, this text turns deeply by finance be an important background with economic globalization, lay particular emphasis on to launch a research from the economic efficiency and the angle of economic safe, these researches all have a great deal of theories and substantial evidence to study a result at home and abroad, this text carried on having selectivity to these researches of drawing lessons from, hope to be logical in all aspects to keep consistently break, this kind of integration and creative work still need to be go into it deeply. The thesis hopes to have a clear but right of confidence to the Chinese fictitious economic of the development grain, and turn progress to have a substantial evidence to the fictitious of the Chinese economy of analysis, this work return is not enough perfect.Collected aspect to do a more work in the data, consider the clues of the international horizontal comparison and the history development, and carried on theories to generalize, but studied the application of the tool is still rougher, some conclusions still need a further verification. The thesis put forward according to China in carrying on the foundation of the research to the development of the Chinese fictitious economy in the way of thinking of the state of the nation. The research expresses the fictitious economy meaning of existence and development lies in its leading to real economy and promote a function, the fictitious economy is an economic system to arrange, the economy that contributes to becoming a kind of market to turn encourages a mechanism, guiding a resources to carry on excellent turn to install, end promote the industry grow up to develop real economy. The structure arrangement and text of this summary, cent the general introduction part and text eight chapter, general introduction part, put forward the background and reason of the research, to tell why put forward the concept of the fictitious economy, fictitious economy of the reality express and evolve the logic carry on introduction and comment on, pointing out the theories and realistic meaning that studies to this problem, and do elucidation to the frame of the research and the method of the usage.The part of the rest discusses one by one in order as follow problems:(I)The fictitious economic theories progress research;(II)The general outline of the fictitious economy definition;(III)Chinese formation mechanism of the fictitious economy; ( IV)The development progress of the Chinese fictitious economy; (V)The relation between fictitious economy and real economy in China;(VI)The condition that the Chinese fictitious economy develops healthily;(VII)The boundary of the Chinese fictitious economic development; (VIII) The fictitious economic angle of Chinese macroscopic economy evaluation and Adjustion . І.The Fictitious Economic Theories Research This chapter carried on introduction and comment on to the fictitious economic theories progress, separateing the abroad and domestic in two clueses. Put forward the concept of the fictitious capital at the earliest stage and carried on to go deep into analytical was a mark to think. Karl Marx ,he put forward the realistic capital and fictitious capital, this to the concept in 《Capital Theory 》 Volume 3. Marx thought of this the research was pushed forward to of the separation of produce sport and the property sport by Rudoff Hilferding.And Thorstein Veblen, the coetaneous with Rudoff Hilferding , studied the difference of the industrial capital and the financial capital, announced the characteristics with mental influence to the market that the financial capital to be subjected.John Maynard Keynes pushed forward the research of Thorstein Veblen, valuing the function of the finance more. Peter F.Drucker put forward the concepts of the sign economy and real economy further, thought the contemporary sign economy had already replaced the real economy that had becomed flywheel of the world economy. At the monetary function aspect, in the theories of the development of the process, the standpoint of the earlier period thought that the merchandise always was purchased by merchandise, the currency had the momentary commutation medium function, be called a dichotomy method. The 20 centuries in the first and the half leaf of, John Maynard Keynes in the aspects of blending the worth theories and the currency theories(1936), Oscar Lange in the space of blending the generally balanced axiology and the currency theories (1944) were to do to contribute. Half after 20 century leaf, the currency theories had a further development with the fusion of the generally economic theories.D.Patinkin put forward the effect concept of actual surplus amount (1965), the actual surplus amount of the currency will influence the merchandise need and the price of the real object part, making the absolute price become a quantity that supplies and all markets to make sure with need in the meantime. Modigliani(1958) in the foundation of inside currency and the outside currency , analyzed the currency further respectively from the bank currency, government currency and mix currency to act as the function process of the wealth effected under circumstance.Milton Friedman (1963) ,Jamas Tobin (1982) further perfect this study. John Muth (1961) put forward the reasonableness expectation concept, Black and others (1986) put forward the model of noise traders that research the formation mechanism of the property foam. Relate to aspect in the fictitious economy and the real economy.Bagehot(1873) carried on a research of the capital flowed function to industrialize England especially in early days. Later of world war two, John G. Gurley and Edward S.Shaw(1960),Hugh T.Patrick,Raymond W.Goldsmith, and etc. They thought , the development of finance promoted the capital save in increment of the quantity, causing to produce physically of growth.70's in 20 centuries ,McKinnon and Edward S.Shaw(1973) put forward the theories of finance to repress-the the finance turns deepening.Appeared in 80's for 20 centuries inside living the finance growth theories and appear a great deal of experience and substantial evidence research. The domestic in fictitious economics of the research also has a lot of scholars.CHEN Si-wei in the foundation of Marx fictitious capital ,did the investigation to the quick development of the fictitious economy at whole world. LIU Jun-min studied the relations between fictitious economy and real economy, think fictitious economy is a market economy alignment in maturity of marking.LI Chong studied from the real object economy toward the currency economy again to finance economy of conversion mechanism.YAO Xian-guo,etc. analyzed China to turn the variety of the financial system in the track process.WANG Ai-jian then analyzed the influence of the financial innovation upon the Chinese fictitious economic development.In addition, some scholars enriched Chinese fictitious economy in the research of the angles of its professional research.LI Yang analyzed the function of the financial globalization, CHEN Liu-qin analyzed financial influence of the innovation upon the monetary policy, CHEN Yong-qin and others researchde the financial property foam problem, XIE Pin , YI Gun and others studied the results of the bank to the function of the real economy, LIU Dong and others analyzed the relation between fictitious economy and real economy, ZHANG Xiao Jing in the angle of history analyzed the currency,stock certificate and finance to develop the emergence of the tool. ІІ.The General Concept of the Fictitious Economy Definition The fictitious economy is in the currency deeply turn the process, the capital takes propagate as a purpose but carries on of turning independently The athletic rights trade, mainly is under the sistuation that the reputation system is compare to develop greatly the economic or financial activity escape from or deviate real economy and obtain an opposite and independent sport form of that part of economy.But the real economy then produce the product that can increase mankind's use value,effect and welfare or serves for it of economic activities is the production and the service activity that the material produces a section.The essence characteristic or content of the fictitious economy are the movement for national independences that the capital is worth appearance, it without resort to produce kimono to attend to fundamentals a body to create the use value and the realization value, but passes the particular rule and form, seeking by oneself increase in value of the capital, ""spend money to earn money"", but exist with real economy again in the meantime extremely close of according to save a relation. The fictitious economy as the form of the independence circulates from real economy in the product and the service of the sport,foreign exchange of the capital , the fluxion of the reputation, can also be called the sign economy, its expressing appearance excessively is a bubble economy.Stock,bond, etc., the stock certificate turn property,futures,option...etc., are the main forms of fictitious economy existing .Ground price of the estate industry becoming and the the collecting industry,gaming industry , also have the parts of the characteristicses of the fictitious economy, but don't belong to fictitious economy. The creation of the fictitious economy relies on certain development,such as social division degree of labour turn deeply in the real economy,popularization of the currency usage, sound of social reputation system, complete legal system, convenience of the information obtain , the progress of trade with technique and means.The economic globalization,the information technique revolution and finance turned innovation to raise the efficiency of the economic activities and the risk of the motion deeply, strengthenning thus a management to the risk of request, pushed to having the risk management moderate to transfer function of fictitious economy the development. The fictitious economy is opposite with real economy should of theories category, is the modern form that the fictitious capital circulate, is the financial activity that has relation with fictitious capital sport, is the currency that the fictitious capital and fictitious turn combines together ,become of the opposite independence deciding the process and opposite and independent movement process in the price of the fictitious capital of the real economy.The fictitious capital has characters of independence,setting,development,expecting,risk(indetermination),liquidity,vivid,international etc., having thus a comprehensive characteristic as follows:(1)Take the entity capital as to rely on and separate with the entity capital;(2)Belong to a financial property;(3)Have the surplus obtains power;(4)Can have much heavy with the existence(fictitious) of many times;(5)Can circulate freely.With make money for purpose of the fictitious capital is the movement corpus of the fictitious economy, its natural character is to want in the sport to seek value to increase in value.The fictitious economy escapes from real economy to combine is a fictitious by being worth the appearance movement for national independence economic fictitious attribute the most basic body .It is constituted the actual contents of the fictitious economy by the economic total amount and economic behavior that the fictitious capital sport become. I think, can put great emphasis on its manifestation and circulate a way to the observation of a kind of economic appearance, the fictitious economy is an opposite real economy but speech of, fictitious economy because of super take off in the real object form of the economic movement, as a result have obviously of to real economy of according to saves the idea that characters,price prop up,circulate the motion,reflection of the appearance to expect of the standard,fictitious degree for running before the fast,rule,total amount variety to request pass to increase,crisis to appear suddenly,economic result of overall. I approve the dividing by Mr.CHEN Si-wie,but belive that the history of fictitious economy can be divided into six stages: 16 centuries the initial the stage to the economic crisis of British in 1825,the embryonic stage;the British economic crisis in 1825 to the economic crisis in world in 1929,the fictitious capital development of the industrial ages;the great crisis went to the Bretton Woods System to disintegrate in 1973 ,took charge of and divided strictly US$ ages of camp;1973-1990 years,the financial liberalism and financial creative period;1990-2000 years,the financial globalization develops greatly, the finance motion strengthen period; later in 2000 years,the Euro currency is rising.Fictitious economy conduct and actions depends on to save the economic appearance that gets up in the real economy development, it is initial and should be the development condition of the real economy with basic decision factor, the structure and scale of the real economy come to a decision the structure and the scale of the fictitious economy.In the meantime, the fictitious economy is the worth system that a kind of idea prop up, its price isn't decide by the inside value or the supply relation of the merchandise, the social people's mental state and expectation are the decision factor of its internalities.There is different index sign for the generous character of the fictitious economy, the most direct index sign is the total amount of the financial property and the specific value of the year’s GDP, and this is an index sign of the total description，classified of the index signs have the foreign exchange storage of the total amount, the sum of foreign exchange trade, the total amount and structure of stock market , sum of stock certificate trade ,stock to circulate the market price total ，etc.. ІІІ.Chinese Formation Mechanism of the Fictitious Economy The real object economy develops in process to make use of in the currency of continuously widespread became currency a predominance type economy. The development of the currency economy, make medium emergence of society a large quantity owns the currency ownership of the currency purchasing power ,they produce related rights in real economy from the investment activity that makes use of the currency ownership to carry on, then producing market behavior of escape from the real economy activity to the bargain of this kind of rights, the popularization of this kind of bargain,standardize to turn with scale to then become the fictitious economic predominance type economy. Later in Chinese reform and open, the socialism market economy system signs really with market to turn degree to deepen, making China represent the specific value of the M2/GDP that the currency turns degree to rise continuously, making the stock,the bond scale of represent the fictitious economic scale extend continuously, having the material foundation of the reality of the fictitious economic development thus.The perfecting of the Chinese fictitious economic law system management system really signs, providing the system foundation for the Chinese fictitious economy development. Study to the development legal system environment of the western and flourishing nations, the Chinese fictitious economy and the comparison of the system mode, express China needs while internationalize the background, speed financial comprehensive step with management. ІV. The Development Progress of the Chinese Fictitious Economy The fictitious economy of China constitutes to win to take the stock and the bond as its corpus.The earliest stock in China appears in 70's in 19 centuries, the earliest stock certificate bargain produces in 20's in 20 centuries, all there were once stock exchanged in Shanghai,Peking,Tienjin, mainly being engaged in the bargain of the government bonds and stock, closing in 50's for 20 centuries.Shanghai and Shenzhen,stock exchange were established at the beginning of 90's in 20centuries and China Securities Regulatory Commission established in 1992, China had contemporary of stock certificate bargain.See from the development process of Chinese contemporary stock market of 15 years, the development speed is quick,the administration intervention is often to be,the market motion is big,the risk trouble is multifarious,the lawmaking is gradually sound,the innovation accelerates gradually,the market turn the internationalization degree to raise gradually,manage is tend in norm gradually, but the existent problems is still more. The Chinese fictitious economy develops in the existent problem:(1)Capital market excessiveness centralization;(2)Be in need of strict system stipulation, the private relation permeates to trade process;(3)The policy adjustment is too multifarious. The difficulty that the Chinese fictitious economic future development face:(1)Indirect margin and directly the funds of the margin fight;(2)The internationalization predicament of the fictitious economic development;(3)The economic corpus is in need of inner-controlled enlargement risk;(4)Negative exterior been limitless to redeem to the financing institution;(5)The currency sovereignty is subjected to threat. V.The Relation between Fictitious Economy and Real Economy in China Global fictitious economic total amount in 90's in 20 centuries present the trend of the acceleration ascension, still place the Chinese economy that turn economic period of track also exists prosperous of inside living the currency growth mechanism, thus the currency turn to lie the appearance that the ratio of currency, financial related ratios ,and financial interrelations ratio,all is placed in to rise continuously .Carry on real economy and fictitious economy comparison, can discover following difference:(1)The history that the real economy appear is consumedly early in the fictitious economy.(2)See from the contents, the development history of the real economy is the history that the productivity develops well, the contents of the fictitious economy then is more abstract with the simplicity;(3)See from time dimension, the real economy body is past labor of the appearance of the coagulation and realistic production, the fictitious economy then displays the possibility of the future development, body now for to expect in the future.(4)See from the bargain price, the real economy decides to be in the cost and supply relation of the product and the service, fictitious economic product the body then is an idea list price now;(5)From sport the appearance see, the real economy variety is more stable, fictitious economy of the development then has bigger motion;(6)See from the movable space, the real economy is subjected to stipulation on the region, the development of the fictitious economy then asks for help the information technique to get more large space to develop easily.(7)From produce the power define to see, the ownership of the real economy,conduct power,handle power,income power and take up power can opposite separation, but fictitious economy because of the rights of the simplicity the economic characteristic request to produce power to affirm strictly to be with the protection;(8)From trade scale to see, the scale of the real economy under the yoke of its natural appearance,the production possibility boundary, the fictitious economy then obtained complete worth appearance, its scale was an infinite aggrandizement from theories' speak of or underrate to near zero of quantity;(9)See from the division of labour of the real economy and fictitious economy, the real economy creates realistic wealth, the fictitious economy detection is a price in the future. The inside contact of the fictitious economy and real economy:The fictitious economy is in response to the development of the real economy to need but produce, and take real economy as foundation, serving for the further development of the real economy of an economic system.The development of the fictitious economy is subjected to the real economy check and supervision, but the scale of the fictitious economy usually will deviate with the scale occurrence of the real economy.The fictitious economy and real economy has a funds to fight a relation.The fictitious economy has larger motion moderate breezes and insurance than the real economy. The fictitious economy and the interaction of the real economy:The fictitious economy can mobilize a society to save for the real economy, providing the margin support;The fictitious economy can transfer risk with the dispersion, lowering real economy bargain cost;The fictitious economy can announce to public a real economy information effectively;The fictitious economy can raise the society movement efficiency. The division of labour and the cooperation of the fictitious economy and real economy:The modern economy is constituted together by the real economy and the fictitious economy of, two kinds of supply well balance of economic systems adjust a development to come to a decision the whole modern economy harmoniously of well balance,moderate and can keep on a development. The composing of the Chinese fictitious economy carries a body is constitute by the nine great systems:(1)Commercial bank;(2)Stock certificate company;(3)Insurance company;(4)The stock certificate investment fund;(5)Trust the investment company;(6)Futures agent company;(7)QFII;(8) Asset Management Corporation（AMC）;(9)National Central Bank. The blemish of the Chinese fictitious economy:(1)Inborn shortage;(2)The ownership of a share partition;(3)Short of check and balance;(4)The property is inferior to turn;(5)The cost is high. ""The gold rate"" of the fictitious economy and real economy look for:Total request, the fictitious economy of development, should take the full development of the real economy as a premise;The good relation between fictitious economy and real economy should express for mutually it all is not produce with the development of the oneself to another one square's negative exterior, contrary, should produce a kind of enhance an effect mutually. The basis connection relation between fictitious economy and real economy to the adjustment of the macroscopic policy:(1)Work hard study fictitious economy a development regulation;(2)Pass the development of fictitious economy to extend a direct margin;(3)The formation synthesizes the financial system with management. VI. The Condition of Chinese Fictitious Economy Develops Healthily Flourishing market economy nations all value a development of pass the fictitious economy to promote the real economy developing in the world, also noticing to adjust fictitious economy to take charge of mode in time according to the variety of circumstance. The United States,Japan,all countries in Southeast Asia is in the experience precept enunciation of fictitious economic problem:The fictitious economy healthly develop, the government has to be have predominant function, the policy has to be adjusted in time, the risk control is a key, the investor rights protection is a core. The fictitious economy develops to manage to the government of request:The first, perfect law making.The second, sound organization.The third, the universality of the push reputation culture and the construction of the reputation system.The fourth, strengthen international the governments of multilateral exchanges and cooperate.The fifth, the respect market rule. To the request that participates corpus:Enhance to manage structure of perfect and profession self-discipline. The request of the society and the cultural environment:Set up investor confidence.The United States,Japan,all countries in Southeast Asia is in the experience precept enunciation of fictitious economic problem:The fictitious economy healthly develop, the government has to be have predominant function, the policy has to be adjusted in time, the risk control is a key, the investor rights protection is a core. VII.The Boundary of the Chinese Fictitious Economic Development The Chinese state of the nation is formation of influence factor of fictitious economy to Chinese:Margin outlet,produce power system,ownership of a share to place for cent is inferior with property to turn,circulation outside the body and underground of the funds is financial,the interest rate market turn. Develop a boundary to the fictitious economy to really settle factor:The currency of the economy turns to turn degree with market;The funds spillage of the real economy and the afflux scale of the exterior funds;Information the technical usage and safe guarantee;Jural sound;Financial innovation;The development and the stability of the society. The fictitious economy escapes from the situation of the real economy:(1)The bargain of the fictitious currency;(2)The business enterprise usage from have a funds to carry on production;(3)Publish the government bonds support government consume; (4)Business enterprise direct margin under of the capital becoming;(5)Business enterprise indirect margin under of the capital becoming;(6) Tobin q phenomenon. The reason that the fictitious economy escapes from the real economy:(1)Bigger motion;(2)The complexity of the price decision;(3)Turn under the track condition of indetermination. The fictitious economy takes place the form of crisis:The stock market tumble,the currency a huge sum of depreciate,the futures market take place huge loss in business,the financing institution is in great quantities bankrupt to close down etc.. The development trend of the Chinese fictitious economy:(1)The development of the real economy will create more ample energy for the fictitious economic system;(2)Information the technical development provided the technique the guarantee for the efficiently circulate of the fictitious economy;(3)The finance mixs already a camp ages and may come according to schedule;(4)The financial innovation will get a fast fierce development. VIII. The Fictitious Economic Angle of Chinese Macroscopic Economy Evaluation and Adjustion Under the closed economic system, the GDP growth means the growth of citizen's wealth, openning gradually of the economy makes the GDP have to increase continuously of living to change quantity outside, open under condition of the GDP and physically wealthy consistency be decided by the exchanges of the domestic and international funds and the commutation of the resources, and the rate of exchange in this kind of funds exchanges change to exchange and resources in of price motion.Take US$ as the international currency of the lord to exist among nations inside of the depreciation incline to of under condition, the economic development of the exit of Chinas direction type strategy appear the GDP high speed growth,foreign exchange storage a high-speed growth also, but the domestic take up employment to live improved phenomenon without the equal degree, this is the material resources and foreign fictitious exchange that uses real economy to exchange actually, producing thus of the wealth shrink. See from the circumstance of the United States, fictitious economy of development not only can become the valid risk income coupling mechanism, dissolve the financial risk in the economic growth, and can to the funds of the outside of the economy become hold out for long time of attraction, can make use of a global resources to used for the economy growth and develop, therefore, Chinese government also should fit government fixed position definitely, norm business enterprise management,pursue true wealth,steadily push forward finance innovation, thus for the growth of Chinese economy create new development space.",1026920713, 中国虚拟经济的宏观分析,Dissertations & Theses," Yang, Dong WanYangWanDongYang, Dong Wan杨万东", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715042721 , 70534652 , 189128 , H379368 , H379368", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 中国虚拟经济的宏观分析,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026920713?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH379368 , Social sciences , economic globalization , fictitious economy , financial market , macroeconomic adjusts and control , real economy , 宏观调控 , 实体经济 , 经济全球化 , 虚拟经济 , 金融市场",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Macroscopic+Analysis+of+Chinese+fictitious+Economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yang%2C+Dong+Wan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Studies on Anti-Japanese War of Korean in Southeast China (1910-1945),"In August, 1910, the Korean Peninsula completely comes down to be the Japanese imperialism colony. Facing the peril of the country and the disaster of the nation, a lot of ambitious gentlemen against the Japanese imperialism who were unwilling to become a slaves without a country migrated to northeast China to make a vigorous start to have carried out anti-Japanese self-movement, in the cause of the independence of Korea and national liberation, it has composed a magnificent epic of Chinese and Korean resisting Japanese aggressor commonly, until a total victory of China's War of Resistance Against Japan in 1945. During the period from 1910 to 1945, Korean anti-Japanese war in northeast China may be divided into three stages: From 1910 to 1919 is the preparation stage of Korean anti-Japanese war in northeast China. In the stage , Korea Nat led the Korean in northeast China to carry out actively to resist the Japanese which took emphasis on patriotic education of anti-Japanese war , construction of anti-Japanese self-movement base areas and the cultivate of military talented person. Not having attached great importance to, although Nat knows the necessity of an armed struggle, which had led to the failure of “313Motion of Dragon Well” in 1919. Bitter experience urged the Nat to come to know that it was impossible to realize the national independence and the national liberation purpose fighting in peaceful way. Therefore, taking “313Motion of Dragon Well” as a turning point, Nat begins to form the anti-Japanese armed forces team actively in northeast China, and gather strength for Korea Revolutionary War accumulates in the future. From 1920 to1931 before the incident of Sep. 18th, is the stage that Korean in northeast China carried out the anti-Japanese armed struggle all round. This expects for a short while, the group allies carried out anti-Japanese self-movement led by Korea Nat owing to disparity in strength reality between the enemy and the selves. Fengwudong war and Qingshanli war in June and October, 1920, are the first successes that anti-Japanese war led by Korea Nat allies. The brilliant military victory has stimulated the spirit of defeating the Japan aggressor, and the belief of realizing a nation’s independence. After the centre of Korean Nat of anti-Japanese self-movement had transferred to the south area, consultant mansion and the justice mansion set up here in 1924, and has set up a prefecture of Xin Min City in 1925. After 1927, Korean Nat and unique Party of active communist organization nation help to bring about a motion with the purpose of building the broad anti-Japanese Korea nation united front in northeast China. Because of the big difference between them, Korea nation resisting Japanese invasion united front failed to be formed ultimately. From the incident of Sep. 18th in 1931 to Japan imperialism was defeated in 1945 is the stage that China-DPRK people allies carrying out the anti-Japanese armed struggle. During this period, both the Nat and the communist have changed the revolution route; China-DPRK unity came to be their common guiding ideology. In the same time, the Korea revolutionary army in south led by the Nat unites, and independent Korea Republic army in north area, united with Chinese soldiers and civilians presently, and resisted the Japan aggressor commonly. Being deserving to be mentioned especially is that the anti-Japanese people revolutionary army and the first army unity in northeast China was a notable struggle, which moved one to song and tears. The Korean communist defies hardship , did not stint life, have made major contribution for the building-up of the people revolutionary army in northeast China and have offered all strengths to the Chinese nation liberation . Meanwhile, they have also fulfilled the historic mission of Korean independence and the national liberation. Recollecting of the history of Koreans resisting Japanese invasion in northeast China from 1910 to 1945, is encouraging, and also is deep in thought. Appraising this one historical fact rightly, excavating the patriotism feelings, noble national integrity, unyielding revolution fighting spirit and disinterested spirit of internationalism have very important history significance. Drawing experience and lessons among them, taking history as warning, have peculiar significance and value. From 1910s, Nat leads the extensive Korea public carry out actively resisting Japanese invasion. They have got the achievement of improving anti-Japanese mental consciousness of Korea public, reinforcing anti-Japanese base area building and training anti-Japanese military and so on. But we have to be seen that, by class limitation effect, Nat has failed to work out the proper political platform on that time, and lost most important support strength from public. The loss and disruption led to the anti-Japanese group being weakened with graveness opposite. The anti-Japanese team effective strength and fighting fruit fails because of there existing the grave localism and factionalism in self. But deep of bitter experiences have shown that, without moping up localism, factionalism and grave factional strife completely, even if having founded the anti-Japanese group, will become feeble and die because of internal disruption and the opposite. During the past the beginning of 1920 age, the early Korea communist composes Korea Manchuria general administration of the Communist Party has gone deep into spreading Marxism and social revolution, has improved nation sense of responsibility and class consciousness of northeast China Korea public, and has strengthened them devoting into the anti-Japanese enthusiasm and national liberation movement. They have not only of expanded the organization basis of cadres and masses, but also trained a lot of talented person for China. Meanwhile, they have organized a lot of progress group, carried out fighting against feudalism actively, forceful boosted domestic national revolution of Korea moving. Korea Manchuria general administration of the Communist Party failed to form the leading nucleus because of the fighting of the factions inside which affected them carrying out anti-Japanese war in a further way. When spreading Marxism-Leninism, the Korean communist was confined to the Korean public only. They failed to combine revolutionary theory with concrete conditions of northeast China Korea public, concrete Chinese revolution reality very good, and failed to ally with extensive Chinese People during the period of the activity of carrying out revolution. The limitations of early phase communism group and Manchuria general administration was combined with which they were in the childhood stage at that time, the Marxism-Leninism theoretical level was not high, and they were short of revolution fighting experience. But whose main cause, depend on that they still stood on the position of Korean revolution prolongs theory to consider Korean independence and national liberation. From this, it had explained deeply that only when we take Marxism as guidance steadfastly, and was tied in wedlock with revolution reality that time closely, ascertain the correct revolution route in a appropriate manner to local conditions, can it be able to overcome the class limitation, overcome the various erroneous ideological trend, and unite all the strength, expand the revolutionary forces unceasingly, until getting the victory ultimately. There is a glittering in the summing up of Korean resisting Japanese invasion in northeast China that Korean in northeast China led by CPC united person of noble aspirations of anti-Japanese war of Chinese nation rapidly and intensely, have composed a magnificent epic that Korea-China people resisted Japanese invasion commonly and righted the enemy valiantly, which has establish the solid basis for both countries to reinforce the China-DPRK working together age after age and contacting with each other, and continued the friendship history . The Korea communist began to abandon Korean revolution prolongs theory, joined the Communist Party of China organization numerously and confusedly according to ""one same clique as the country of"" Communist International and the principles made by the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. It not only has expanded the strength of Communist Party of China in northeast China, and has accelerated work centre of the Communist Party of China in northeast China transferring from city metastasis to rural area. Uncounted Korean communist opposing still carried out resisting Japanese invasion with the suspicion of ""people's livelihood regiment "" in fight of resisting"" left"" ,""people's livelihood regiment "" . The Korean revolutionist did not mind individual safety and danger, gave no consideration to individual humiliation in adverse circumstances environment, they took anti-Japanese war as first-class mission all the time. That has educated northeast China public extensively, and stimulate them to advance wave upon wave , fight with Japanese bravely. The disinteresting action and noble feelings of concentrating efforts on liberating all the time of extensive Korean revolutionist who was not fussy about nation advantages and disadvantages will be engraved on forever by the Chinese nation. Afterwards, the extensive Korean revolutionist and Korean advance wave upon wave defying hardship under he anti-Japanese national united front led by Communist Party of China. They were brave in the face of danger from powerful Japan aggressor, united with China shoulder to shoulder and were encouraged fight with Japanese person all the time in the distressed and lofty environment, which has shown the unyielding national integrity and written the brilliant history fighting bravely. The China-DPRK revolutionist have attacked the Japan aggressor in close coordination, were at bay and brave in innumerable time of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare battle during the people revolutionary army period and unite-resisting period. The Korean revolutionist have irrigated Chinese land with blood, dedicated life to liberation of China-DPRK people under the banner of the proletariat and the patriotism. The revolutionary friendship of the Korea-China revolutionist going through thick and thinning together in revolutionary has become the historical origins Of China-DPRK people in present age continuing the friendship and developing in cooperation.

How to prevent and avert financial risks thus need to be investigated into. In order to control the financial risks or to tackle any financial crisis in China, it is necessary to clearly understand the systemic reasons, and internal and external factors that cause the financial risks. Theoretically, financial risks stem from limitation of sensibility and asymmetry of information, but the features of financial risks vary in different countries for specific reasons. There are quantities of papers on the common reasons for financial risks, but few on the financial risks in China during transitional period, especially on transferring of fiscal risk in China to financial risks. Having analyzed the special formation system of financial risks during the transitional period and the transferring of the fiscal risks, this thesis manages to explore the pre-warning system and strategy to prevent and avert financial risk during transitional period in China. The thesis consists of six chapters. It begins with reviewing of former theories on the financial risk and constructing of a new theory framework, which shall be the basis to further investigate. Then it systematically looks into the formation mechanism of financial risk from internal formation system and external transferring system. Having reviewed the pre-warning system in foreign countries and the transferring of fiscal risks in China to financial risks, it investigates both the internal and external factors that cause the financial risks during the transitional period in China. Finally, it comes up with suggestions on how to establish new type relations between fiscal system and financial system, and strategies to avert financial risks. Chapter One carries detailed analysis of Marxist and Western theories on financial risks after analysis of generic theories and reasons for formation of financial risks. According to the author, financial risks refer to the magnitude and probability of losses caused to the entity by uncertainty and fluctuation in the economic factors in the financial market under certain conditions and in certain periods. The magnitude and probability of losses are essential to reflect financial risks. Generally, the financial risks stem mainly from economic and social specialization, multiform of its derivative transactions, limited sensibility and opportunistic inclinations by economic participants, uncertainty of economic conditions, asymmetry of information, and financial system and its evolvement. Chapter Two systematically analyzes the formation of the financial risks mainly from financial system, economic structure, and opening economy. It argues that under the floating exchange rate system, there usually exists excessive fluctuation and mismatch in the exchange rates. The floating exchange rate system will speed up the internationalization of virtual capital, and then increase the uncertainty and risks of the financial markets. Then weakened control by monetary authority over the speculative capitals contributes to the fast growth and movement of speculative capitals and thus generates negative impacts on the world economy. However, under the highly integrated global financial system, the peg system will also have irresolvable internal conflicts. When the control over capital flows is loosened, the peg system will usually magnify the external impacts and thus make a currency crisis and the Domino Effect quite easy. Among those factors leading to financial crisis, actual economic and investment activities are always the main ones. It can be seen from the flaws and mistakes in economic and investment activities, financial risks caused by economic cyclical fluctuations and structural changes. Even the financial investment process that is more and more deeply affected by the formation process of financial risks is also subject to the actual economic and investment activities. In addition, modern information transmission and financial liberalization substantially accelerate fund moving in the global financial market. Investors, fund-suppliers, and markets in each country thus all merge into global financial market. Such a global capital moving, far beyond goods and merchandise, becomes one of most active factors in the current world economy, and then forcibly influences the allocation of international financial resources in the global range, and alternates each country’s economic efficiency, and increases the volatility and uncertainty of price signal, and supply and demand of financial transactions. Especially, a large scale of international short-term capital consequently imposes impact on the effectiveness of macro-economic policies of each government and on the micro-decision of each sort of economic entity. Chapter Three preliminarily explores the modality of establishment of financial risk pre-warning and prevention system in China based on empirical study of the foreign financial risk pre-warning and prevention system. The author argues that all macro-departments are inter-related and there exist causal relations among macro-economic indicators, and continuously worsened macro-economic indicators always come first before financial crisis. A pre-warning system can inform people of an impending financial crisis and help the people to avert it. History teaches people that it is urgent and necessary to set up a system to monitor the financial risks. In reality, it is very difficult to analyze and forecast financial risks and crises. Such a comprehensive analysis on different types of financial risks is imperative. It is difficult to classify a financial crisis into a certain category, but a big financial crisis always comes after an unbalanced economy that contains a certain kind of financial risk. Therefore, pre-warning should start from pre-warning on the initial financial risks, which is significant in preventing the outbreak of financial crises. Chapter Four systematically analyzes both the internal and external factors causing the financial crisis during the transitional period in China respectively from the structural factors, market factors and international factors. The purpose to study the financial crisis in China is to get to know the features of financial risks in China and to prevent the financial safety in China from the accumulation of financial risks. The author believes that there exist diversity and controllability of financial risks in a market economy while concentration and invisibility in the planning system. Then accumulation and acceleration will feature the financial risks during the transitional periods in China. At present, China is transforming from planning system to market economy; both old and new systems coexist. On the one hand, old system is still functioning in many areas of the social economy, blocking the setup and operating of the new system. On the other hand, the new system originating from the old system is still imperfect and can not yet effectively regulate and adjust its own operations. As a result, the new system has to resort to the old system. Under the current special circumstances the financial risks in China not only carries the generic risks in the market economy and traditional risks during the early stages of financial market but also are featured as systemic risks during the transitional period in China. The author has indicated that financial problems are results of long-term accumulation, reflecting multi-layer internal conflicts embedded in the economy: not only systemic factors but also managerial factors, not only structural reasons arising from the transitions from the planning economy to the market economy but also imbalances generated from the financial system reforms; not only problems generated from transitions from closed economic system to the open economic system but also problems stemming from imbalances in the market economy; not only historical problems but also new problems generated from the excessive expansion of capital because of the soft budgeting. Due to the complexity, diversity and comprehensiveness, comprehensive measures and strategies must be taken against financial risks. Chapter Five systematically analyzes the transferring of the fiscal risks in China to the financial risk based on its elaborating of relations between fiscal risks and financial risks. Owing to defects of fiscal policy in China and mismatch of fiscal and monetary policies, it is a long period the state treasury has been leading to accumulation of financial risks by having financial institutions finance its expenditures by which fiscal risks were transferred. In other words, the transferring of fiscal risks to financial risks relies on the close relations between state treasury and financial institutions. The author argues that banks depend on the balance of fund flow-in and flow-out with a steady state. While the outcome of the transferring of fiscal risks to banks will be to utilize the fund of saving deposit, and then the assets of this utilization will mainly evolve risk assets of the banks. Such a transferring weakens banks’ liquidity and violates business order of banking sector, and brings about many of restructure, withdrawal and bankruptcy of financial institutions. Nevertheless the cost of dissolving the risks are much higher than one of leading to risks. Chapter Six comes up with ideas and methodologies to prevent and dissolve financial risks in China from the aspects of strategies, environments, macro &amp; micro-economic policies. The author proves that both state treasury and financial institutions are fund providers, but different features of the funds from two channels define their range and mechanism and objects. Sometimes state treasury and financial institutions overlap their activities, but such a overlapping cannot change the basic features of non-compensation of fiscal fund or compensation of credit fund. So fiscal activities and financial activities shall abide each own rules and play proper roles in different areas. In practice, the most important task is currently to define the functions of state treasury and financial institutions and the relations of these two fund suppliers, and then to confine the activities of two sectors and the rules for special issues. Thus, to effectively prevent and dissolve financial risks during transitional period in China need not only flexibly coordinating fiscal and monetary policies, but also taking corresponding measures at the levels of macro µ economies. At the period when financial institutions adopt modern enterprise system and rules, supervisory institution shall adapt itself to the trend of mixing financial businesses and establish the financial supervision and administration system that suits China’s situations.",1026922932," 经济转轨时期金融风险问题研究                ——兼论财政风险向金融风险的转嫁路径",Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Qiang TianZhangTianQiangZhang, Qiang Tian张天强", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715043531 , 70534682 , 189128 , H391852 , H391852", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese," 经济转轨时期金融风险问题研究                ——兼论财政风险向金融风险的转嫁路径",2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026922932?accountid=14496, 0508 Finance, 0508 Finance, 0508 Finance,, 0508 Finance, Finance," (UMI)AAIH391852 , Social sciences , Financial Risk , Fiscal Risk , Transitional Period , 经济转轨 , 财政风险 , 金融风险",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Study+on+Financial+Risk+During+Transitional+Period+%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0AAnd+on+Transferring+of+Fiscal+Risk+to+Financial+Risk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Qiang+Tian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"China's Ethnic Regional Autonomy System and the Economic Development in Xinjiang,"Ethnic regional autonomy is creative decision-making of the Communist Party of China in solving the Chinese nationality question. It is the China's basic political system whose basic goal is to maintain the unification of China multinational country and to realize various nationalities equality, the unity and the common prosperity. According to the Marxism political economy principle, the economic basis and the overtop structure restrict and affect mutually. As the politics overtop structure, the system of ethnic regional autonomy can display its superiority and realize various nationalities' communal development truly only then it adapts and consummates mutually with the economical development of the regional autonomy for nationalities place. Therefore, whether it is advantageous to the productive forces development in the multi-national area.whether it isadvantageous to various nationalities living standard enhancement become the important criterion and the basic standard to adhere to and consummate the system of ethnic regional autonomy. Xinjiang has a general region, multitudinous nationalities and relatively thick religious atmosphere; the peripheral geography environment is complex. The economical development is not balanced for a long time. Xinjiang's economical development not only relates to the Xinjiang various nationalities' vital interest, moreover relates to the stablity of China's border area and the long-term peace. Considering to the congenital deficience of Xinjiang’s economic development as well as each kind of complex social factor in restricting economy development, it is impossible to develop in the short time if there have not the pointed system to make the safeguard. Therefore, Xinjiang’s economic development must be based on special system that suits Xinjiang actual condition. Through the scientific and reasonable system that mountain ethnic relations solve the nationality question, respect nationality multiplicity development realizes the unification approval of various nationalities. This can realize the organic synthesis of solving nationality question and keeping country unification. And in this foundation, through the related policy arrangement, stimulates the intrinsic power of Xinjiang various nationalities to achieve the basic goal of national equality, development and common prosperity China's ethnic regional autonomy system is the union of ""the political factor"" and ""the economic agent"". ""The political factor"" refers to that it is the main symbol of national equality and it makes each national minority to be the master of their own affairs in national autonomy place. At the same time, China's ethnic regional autonomy system makes the national minorities willing to form the great family of nationalities with the Han Nationality and other national minorities, unites voluntarily into the political basis of a unified country. Then ""economic agent"" refers to the economic cooperation relations in a local scope. The establishment of regional autonomy for nationalities forms the supplementary economical relations between the national minority and the Han Nationality which is helpful to the national equality and the national unity, achieves the correct union of ""the political factor"" and ""the economic agent"". Looked from this, the establishment and development of ethnic regional autonomy system is the epoch-making important matter in Xinjiang. It causes various races populace to enjoy truly the right of being the masters of their own affairs. It has provided for the policy environment and the political basis to maintain China’s unity and economic, cultural and social enterprise development and the implementation of national equal principle in Xinjiang. The various nationalities surmounted the different stages of the social development, developed largely the agricultural synthesis productivity and established modern industry system of the quite reasonable structure, more prominent characteristic from a backward area where basically did not have the modern industry and could not be self-sufficient after building the system of ethnic regional atuonomy. The practice of 50 years in Xinjiang proved the ethnic regional autonomy system conforms to the Chinese national condition, conforms to the Xinjiang reality, serves various nationalities' basic interest and has the formidable vitalit. The establishment of ethnic regional autonomy system is one of the basic reasons of Xinjiang economic development before the reform and open policy. Early days of liberation, Xinjiang's economic society level of development was extremely low; the national barrier formed in the history was very deep. Therefore, the Communist Party of China carried on the party building, established the people’s government at that time, put down a rebellion bandits in order to stable social order and earnestly implemented party's national religion policy. What more important was the movement of the rent reduction and the land reform under the realistic condition of the nationality religion in Xinjiang caused various races people to stand up in politics and economy.acted as the master. This eliminated fundamentally the foundation of nationality oppressed, laid the solid foundation for the realization of the new ethnic relations and the development of equal cooperation. Under this premise, Xinjiang carried out the establishment of the ethnic regional autonomy system.gradually. The ethnic regional autonomy system had provided good environment to the economic development in Xinjiang before the reform and open policy. It had guaranteed the implementation realization of preferential policy of the country to Xinjiang. At the same time, it impelled the correct solution of Xinjiang’s nationality religion question, thus promoted the Xinjiang economic development before the reform and open policy. On the other hand, Xinjiang's planned economy system restricted seriously the national region autonomy right before the reform and open policy. Under this system, local authority's jurisdiction was very small, the majority of decision-making was made by the central government and the autonomy place did not obtain the economic right to develop local economy independendly according to the realistic condition. Although the central government supported Xinjiang through many preferential policies in fund, manpower and physical resource, the neglect of commodity economy and the law of value, neglect its own characteristic in Xinjiang had brought the negative function for the long-term development of the ethnic regional autonomy place. The economic autonomy was unable to carry out caused the restriction to realize other autonomy right. Therefore, economic development under the planned economy system played a important role to the consolidation of the ethnic regional autonomy system only in the certain time, the superiority of multi-national area can not be displayed if it was implementated for a long term. The basic goal of the ethnic regional autonomy system is to realize the nationalities’ development and the enhancement of nationality living standard is its basic goal. If it cannot be achieve, how does the regional autonomy superiority manifest? How does the national equality maintain? After ""the Great Cultural Revolution"" movement had ended the process of the reform and open policy starts to carry on in xinjiang after bringing order out of chaos and the comprehensive realization of ethnic regional autonomy system. The farmland and pasture economic restructuring enable various races herdsman to get rid of impoverishment. The rural enterprise has sped up the step which various races herdsman became rich. The urban economy organizational reform has improved and raised enormously the city inhabitant's living standard. The opening to the outside world has also caused various races people to break through the region limit and moves towards the world. These huge changes have consolidated the ethnic regional autonomy system in xinjiang's implementation. At the same time, the ethnic regional autonomy system has built the stable and harmonious social environment for xinjiang's economic restructuring. The formulation implementation of the Law of national region has provided the legal safeguard for xinjiang's reform and open policy. Training and using national minority cadre vigorously is the key which reform and open policy smoothly carries on in xinjiang. Developing the national minority culture and the education vigorously has raised the talented person of all kinds of fields during the process of the reform and open policy. Along with the further deepening of economic restructuring and after the establishment of socialist market economy system in the 90s of the twenties century, some national region preferential policies formulated under the planned economy system expire gradually. Adds on the country non-balanced developmental strategy, the economical development disparity has enlarged unceasingly between xinjiang and the eastern area as well as in the different places within xinjiang. The national minority is in the inferiority in the market competition, which has created the non-synchronization between the regional development and the nationality development and has increased the harmonious factor between the different nationalities. Looking from the international environment, the great change in some socialist countries in eastern European and the disintegration of former Soviet Union made great effect to the world’s condition. The western hostile influence try to split up China using"" national religion question"" and carries on the seepage to xinjiang. Such questions present the new challenge to our persisting and consolidating the ethnic regional autonomy system. The great change in east Europe and the former Soviet Union also showed that the serious unbalanced condition of economical development in the different regions and nationalities initiated the nationality to separate based on strengthening the national consciousness and creates the tragedy of country’s disintegration in the end. Therefore, the important guarantee of the stability and the development of china under the economical globalization background is to further consummate the ethnic regional autonomy system and to promote the economic society development in the multi-national area and to reduce the development disparity in the East-West section area based on their experience and lessons and links to the Chinese reality. The development strategy of the west areas in China is present on the 15th session of Fourth Plenary Session of Communist Party of China through the paper of",1026923156, 论民族区域自治制度与新疆经济发展,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Can WenZhangWenCanZhang, Can Wen张文灿", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715038081 , 70534442 , 189128 , H385237 , H385237", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 论民族区域自治制度与新疆经济发展,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923156?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH385237 , Social sciences , china's ethnic regional autonomy system , economic developmrnt , xinjiang , 新疆 , 民族区域自治制度 , 经济发展",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=China%27s+Ethnic+Regional+Autonomy+System+and+the+Economic+Development+in+Xinjiang&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Can+Wen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Research on the Values of Crime Stratification in Criminal Policy and Criminal Legislation,"Crime refers to the behavior harmful to the society, which should be cracked down. Crime Stratification means all the crimes are stratified to different levels according to the severity degree of the crime. Crime policy is an integrated system including strategy, policy, tactic and method, established by the country and society to crack down on the crime effectively and reasonably. The criminal policy importance of crime stratification holds: according to the severity of the crime, all the crimes shall be stratified to different levels, which can be treated with different principles and methods, if it is appropriate and effective in the control of crime, if it is enforceable, what is the positive perspective and what is the negative, how to achieve the best crime control effect and how to design it specifically. Criminal legislation means that: what affect one theory or idea can have on the legislation, or how it is necessary and enforceable in the legislation. With the above concepts, the paper mainly illustrates on the following contents: I. A Summary of Crime Stratification, which includes two questions : one is the mode of crime stratification, which means the mode that all crimes are stratified into different levels according to the severity degree in terms of criminal law. The criminal laws in the world can be divided into such modes as : 1. Dichotomy Mode, that means all the criminal laws are stratified into two levels according to the severity degree or penalty of the crime. 2. Trichotomy Mode, that means all the criminal laws are stratified into three levels according to the severity degree or penalty of the crime. 3. Quartation Mode, all the criminal laws are stratified into four levels according to the severity degree or penalty of the crime. 4. Multichotomy Mode, all the criminal laws are stratified into five or even more levels according to the severity degree or penalty of the crime. The other is the standard of the crime stratification, which falls into two categories : 1. according to the severity of the penalty, the crime behavior are stratified. This is called the form standard. 2. the crime behavior can be stratified according to the severity or the nature and degree of damage to the society by the crime behavior. It is called the entity standard, de facto standard or severity standard. According to the difference of the judged subject, the entity standard is based on three perspectives : nation perspective, which is also called legislator’s perspective, means the legislator judege the severity of the crime on behalf of the country ; expert perspective, which represents the conceptual knowledge of the criminal law scholar on teh severity of the crime ; the hoi polloi perspective, which means the judgement made by the hoi polloi on the severity of the crime. This judgements are mostly based on sesibility. II. The importance of crime stratification to the criminal decision. Criminal decision refers to the decision of the crime control and ruling of all the related departments and fields. For the convenience of analysis, the paper will take “Severe Crack Down” as a sample for the analysis of criminal decision-making. It is detailed as: the crime can be stratified to two levels according to the severity of the crime. Those crimes that cause severe threat to the society and people will be severely cracked down. However, the crimes that do not cause severe damage to the society will have comparatively loose criminal policy. The purpose is to make the criminal decision more reasonable. As to the “Sever Crack Down”, the effect of crime stratification can include: 1. it make the “Crack Down” more reasonable, systematical, less emotionally involved and make the decision making more scientifically. 2. It can change the profile of “Crack Down” from a movement to a reasonable and appropriate criminal policy and minimize the negative effect; 3. it can realize the reasonable distribution of the judicatory resource between the severe and light crime and maximize the effect of criminal law, protect the human rights and enhance the spirit of law; 4. it can realize the connection and exchange between the Chinese criminal policy and the international criminal policy. III. The role crime stratification plays in the integral criminal law system. Based on a substantial understanding of the concept of crime and penalty, the “General Penalty” refers to a law principle that brings people certain kind of suffering from exploitation as a consequence of law breach. In the context of Chinese situation, it includes criminal law, labor cultivation, police penalty. The specific idea of crime stratification is that: all the crimes are stratified according to the severity; the severity of the penalty is dependent on the severity of the crime. The penalty system is set up according to the severity of the crime. Based on this thread and the auxiliary efforts of policy penalty system, the general system can work smoothly. Thus, a legal system that can have penalty in accordance with the severity of the crime will be established. The effect the crime stratification has on the law is: 1. it is good to promote the reasonable distribution and integral enforcement of the national power; 2. it is good for the realization of the legalization and the judicature of the criminal field; 3. it is good for the reasonable adjustment of the criminal law subjects and the crime behavior penalty system. IV. The role crime stratification plays in the regulation and adjustment of the criminal law. The current “Small Criminal Law” system (including penal code, criminal law amendments, single file criminal law and legislation interpretation) in our country has many demerits in terms of crime stratification. The writer thinks that the an introduction of crime stratification in the criminal law system, the replacement of current judgment system on the crime with crime stratification, can make the criminal system more standardized and effective. Although, the analysis takes the current criminal law system as a sample, the principle illustrated here is also suitable for the criminal law system after the integration. The effect that crime stratification has on the smooth work of criminal law system is mainly on two perspectives: one is it can correct the original criminal laws; the second is that it is a reasonable addition to the original version. The former includes: 1. replace the enumeration legislation with crime stratification, and realize the integration of standard; 2. restrict the sentence with crime stratification; 3. replace the general criterion on which the severity of the crime is judged with crime stratification, and realize the transition of the system. The latter includes: 1. Restrict the penalty scope of the prepared and abortive behavior with crime stratification, change the current rules in the criminal law that there is no discrimination on the sentence and treatment of different crimes at different degrees; 2. Construct a reasonable criminal record abolishing system with crime stratification, make judgment on the time of criminal record abolishing with the severity and damage of the criminal behavior. Crime stratification is also connected to the criminal law systems such as: the penalty scope of co-criminal, assoil system, recidivism, etc. What’s more, Crime stratification can make contribution to the restriction of death penalty. It is detailed as: independently set up the most severe crime level in the crime stratification，and the level should be defined as intended crime and the consequence is detrimental to people’s life；Then it is prescribed in the general principles of the criminal law that death penalty is only restricted to the most severe crime, and the accusal of the death penalty can be restricted by the special provisions according to the meaning of “the most severe crime” in the general principle. Thus the restriction on death penalty can be maximized on the legislation and justice practice. V. The inspection and review of crime stratification. The construction of crime stratification systems have to be based on the current experiences and avoid the repetition of the mistakes and suitable for the need of the society and the time. The experiences that crime stratification can use for reference are as followed: the historical experience of crime stratification in China；the historical experience of crime stratification in other countries, and the crime stratification experience in the practice of Chinese criminal law. There are two perspectives in the Chinese historical experience: 1. The legislators integrate the country’s will and people’s belief. Currently, as the legislation representative, the country must attach great importance to the value belief and interest demand of the residence rather than blindly taking accounts to the national interests only; 2. Replace the original “Ten Severe Crimes” with “Ten Ferocity”, which boasts the function of instruction and prevention rather than crack down afterwards. The current crime stratification system shall also notice the instruction and prevention functions of the criminal law. The experience in other countries includes: 1. Crime stratification must catch up with the social and cultural concept; 2. Crime stratification must match with other laws and regulations；3. Restrict the national administration right by crime stratification；4. The mode of crime stratification must be reasonable；5. Crime stratification must be integrated with other criminal law systems；6. Restrict the application of death penalty by crime stratification；7. Promote the justice of sentence by crime stratification；8. Avoid unreasonable factors in the crack down of crime by crime stratification；9. Attach importance to the technological difficulties triggered by the factors like crime circumstance in crime stratification. The experience in China includes:（1）the practice of criminal law: the decision intends to restrict the subjects of the crack down to the severe crimes. This concept should be insisted on; （2） the legislation of criminal law has to be notified that:：there has to be a good join between the criminal law (broad sense) and the administrative penalty in terms of the stratification on the penalty object. There should not be any enforcement vacancy left. There should be a reasonable line between the criminal law and administrative rule in terms of the nature of crime.（3）In terms of criminal law enforcement, the law enforcement department has no definite requirements on the stratification，but different departments and bodies tend to stratify in many cases. As a collectivity, the judicial practice needs crime stratification and actually is carrying on the crime stratification. This demand of crime stratification will be reflected in many ways. Some of the expressions have to be changed. The most suitable way is by the improving the crime stratification system through legislation. VI. The Bases of Crime stratification: the bases of crime stratification refer to the warranty, which can decide the severity of the crime, in other words, the “ Severity of the Social Damage” by the crime. The inner structure includes objective damage and subjective intention. The objective damage shall include the factors below: 1. The crime object, or legal interest, which had two perspectives of comparison: the first is a comparison among the individual, national and social legal interest. The conclusion is: the individual legal interest is superior to the national in terms of development. The second is a comparison among the factors of the individual legal interest. The conclusion is that the right of life is the most important, then comes the integrity of the body and health, and then, the right of freedom and property, the last is the right of reputation, religious freedom and other rights. 2. Behavior and Means: different crime behavior has different harm. The more violent the behavior is the more harmful it is to the victim. According to the violence of the behavior, the crime behavior can be divided as violent crime and non-violent crime; the former is divided into armed violent crime and ordinary violent crime in terms of whether weapons are used in the crime; the latter basically includes deceived and secrete ways. In terms of the organization of the crime behavior, they can be divided as: organized crime, gang and non organized crime. 3. The realized degree of the behavior. 4. The crime object, which includes: if the crime object is fragile to the crime and the importance of the object. 5. The fatalness of the doer. 6. Time and venue. The degree of the subjective crime intension can be reverted to the degree of the control the psychological movements poses to the realization of the behavior, on which the severity of the crime can be judged. 1. In terms of the cognizing process, the clearer the cognizing of the behavior or the conjuncture, the definite of the consequence of the behavior or conjecture, thus, the more damage it will cause. 2. In terms of the volition process, the more intense the crime behavior, the more perseverant of tackling the difficulties on crime, the clear the volition, the more harmful the intended crime. While in the involuntary crime, the less intended the criminal, the more dangerous it is to the society. The cognizing process plays a decisive role in the judgment of crime severity. 3. In terms of emotion, if the criminal realizes the possible legal penalty of its crime but remains fearless, the damage will be very harmful; if the criminal realizes by committing the crime he or she can get a kind of benefit, this will also cause great danger to the society. 4. In terms of psychological condition, it's the background of the psychological movements expression. The background can sometimes influence the cognition scope and the will power. In a state of excitement, the cognition is not comprehensive and the control power is dramatically dropped. The emotion crime shall be extended with mercy. For in the circumstance, the individual is quite difficult to control the behavior. If the criminal committed the crime in a very stable psychological situation, he or she shall be denounced accelerated. VII. The specific rules of crime stratification. In the current cognitive ability, the detailed stratification principles can be defined according to the social harm degree factors: 1. The most harmful objective crime and subjective intention, which show no sign of convergence, shall be judged as severe crime. 2. The lest harmful objective crime and subjective intention, which show no sign of reinforcement shall be judged as the lightest crime. 3. The severity of the crime is zero, thus the objective crime and subjective intention are not be judged as crime. 4. If the objective crime and subjective intention are accelerated in the same direction, the severity of the crime will be increased, and vice versa. 5. When there is a contradiction between objective crime and subjective intention, that is to say, the objective crime increase will cause the decrease of subjective intention, vice versa, then the lighter party will have decisive role on the judgment of severity. The effect of public comments on crime stratification, the author holds that: based on a reasonable analysis of the scholar, it can be adjusted according to the result of survey on public opinion. This can furthermore meet the emotional demand of the public; increase their cognition of the law. The reason why it can not be set as the main base is that the public comments are emotional judgment rather than reasonable judgment, which can be distorted sometimes because of lack of understanding on the truth. The effect that crime circumstance has on crime stratification shall be treated according to the difference of categories. （1）crime circumstance can fall into two categories such as: the general principle and special prescription. The former is not in the scope of discussion, it has no effect on crime stratification.（2）crime circumstance can be divided into composing circumstance and sentence criterion circumstance. The latter has no effect on crime stratification. The former can influence the crime stratification，but it depends.（3）The composing circumstance falls into basic, aggravated and alleviated circumstances in terms of its function. In terms of expression form, it can be divided as abstract and specified composing circumstance. The category of abstract composing circumstance is overlapped with the basic, aggravated and alleviated circumstances. It is abstract basic composing circumstance, abstract alleviate composing circumstance and abstract aggravate composing circumstance. After the implement of crime stratification system, the quantitative crime factors will be abolished，the abstract basic composing circumstance can be out of the prescription；In terms of the spirit of human rights protection, the abstract aggravated composing circumstance shall not influence the level of crime. The abstract alleviated composing circumstance shall also be avoided. The specified composing circumstance and the aggravated or alleviated composing circumstance are overleaped.

The present stage consummates gradually which in the knowledge economy fast development and the socialist market economy system, the army equipment construction development external environment and the intrinsic essential factor has all had the remarkable change. The original high degree of concentration, the plan tows the equipment management pattern, is transforming gradually into the level-to-level administration and the market direction pattern. The price work took in the equipment work the important constituent, it namely is closely linked with the equipment construction, also close unites with the national economy national economy and the national defense science and technology industrial development, which synthetically reflects and affects the equipment construction development scale and the advancement, and also concerns equipment construction general situation. The correct analysis current international domestic new situation, the new situation, the new problem, exploring and grasping the work characteristics and rules of equipment price and positive, safely carrying on the reform innovation, introducing the competitive system unceasingly, doing well the equipment price level regulation, strengthening legal status of plan contract, cultivating the weaponry life cycle expense management pattern vigorously, improving the equipment purchase quality and the military economic efficiency, reducing the purchase cost and cycle, going out ""the investment few, the benefit is high"" the equipment to purchase the new pathway, which at present appears especially urgent and the need, and which plays a decisive role and has the profound influence on equipment price work next development direction and the management method. From doing well the equipment price level the regulation and the exploration equipment price administration mentality embarks, determined the just equipment price, the realization equipment funds benefit maximization, is the practical significance and the goal which this article studies is at. This article altogether is divided five chapters, the contents mainly are: First chapter: introductory remarks. From the topic research background, the significance and the research of equipment price control method at home and abroad in present situation, elaborated the proposition research objective necessity. Second chapter: Outline of Equipment price control method. Mainly from the formation and the development of equipment price theory, and the connotation and historical development process of equipment price control method, proposing the important status of equipment price control in the equipment construction work. Is the same with the general commodity price, the equipment price also is equips the value the currency performance, responded (national security) is approved by the market the work content. But the approval of market (national security), is for satisfy the entire social the safety requirement, in order to gain the goal of national defense, which has the sharing and the sociality of the subject of consumption. Had decided consumer's increase cannot cause the production cost change, namely more than 1 consumers cause the society marginal cost is zero. Expense sharing had also decided the members of different social classes all have the enhancement national defense the duty and the responsibility, all should first complete the equipment ordering and the production task including civil enterprise's any domestic enterprise, these duties and the responsibility have the national law compulsorily. From this significance, the equipment price control work has its special connotation and the essential factor. To equips the price the control materially is through to equips the price level the regulation and the equipment price management, seeks under the plan quantity condition to equip the price the justice, causes the enterprise to obtain as far as possible decides under the quantity condition the marginal cost, the coordination undertakes to manufacture the unit and the army economic relations Third chapter: Equipment price control movement foundation. Take the commodity attribute which equips as breakthrough point, to equipped the market the characteristic, the effect, the function, the intrinsic structure as well as cultivates under the market economy condition the equipment market system related question to carry on the analysis, discussed under the socialist market economy condition to equip the price control the economic theory foundation. To equips commodity attribute recognizing, is advantageous in breaks the profession, the department boundary, the realization equipment development, the production socialization. Because equips the development production the war industry business unit which assigns by the country carries on, monopolizes into this system the malpractice. The acknowledgement equipment commodity attribute, moves towards the market, according to the commodity economy development request for the defense industry, breaks the division of vertical (i.e., the military and civilian division and the seal defense industry system, enhances the equipment development production the socialized degree, has created the prerequisite. But equips the price mechanism the function is limited, because equips the plan is according to the national security need, must guarantee the certain deterrent scale, therefore cannot subscribe as a result of price GAO Eshoo, the price is somewhat low but subscribes much. Looked from producer's angle, also cannot because some equipment price is high, transfers but goes into production or enhances the output, also cannot because the price somewhat low or does not produce on the reduced production. Therefore price in equips in the market to equip the resources the setting-up is extremely limited, often is take completing which plans as the goal performs to formulate, serves and obeys in the equipment construction general situation. The fourth chapter: The present situation analysis of equipment price control method. Through situation and existence question analysis which current faces to the weaponry, analyzed the present equipment price control method and between the current equipment developments demand with emphasis not the compatibility. First, the equipment price level regulation vacancy, the function which regulates from the military looked, in the current national economy national economy development, the income assignment policy and the military expenses purchasing power decides in the situation, the price fluctuation is affects the equipment price level the primary factor. Along with the raw material, the personnel wages and so on the expense level unceasing rise, the war industry enterprise under the fixed price pattern which the military goods price entire cost compensates, does not have the external pressure, its response is not makes the constitutive under the military expenses restraint adjustment (this kind of structure adjustment to contain product structure adjustment, devotionment structure adjustment, production method structure adjustment), but is craves in ""passes the burden"", does not drop (even enhances) under the goal in the profit level to the army implementation to pass the burden, causes the equipment price level the unceasing rise, enormous influence to equipment construction development; the second is the information mechanism inherent contradictions and the adjustment low efficiency, elaborated the equipment particularity from seven stratification planes to decide the information processing or price adjustment plan itself received is separated from the market supply and demand strength the benefit relations restriction, from current state-owned enterprise's management system and single-product economy entity characteristic analysis, existence information not symmetry and benefit conflict these two influences military goods price science reasonable establishment fundamental question; Three is the defense industry system establishment also has the imperfect place, ten big war industries groups' separation, only was had the change in the management pattern, because the product nature and the development direction have the essentially difference, the market entered mutually with the competition is extremely difficult, at the same time because had enterprise group's nature, for group's benefit, could implement the profession conformity, raise the department to enter the threshold, the implementation competes in disguised form and so on the counter- market mechanism behavior, did not favor equips the market the formation and the equipment construction development; Four is present price structure means related equipment cost recognizing, also is ""occurs namely is reasonable"" is accountant the premise, is one kind completely take the seller as the leading means, does not favor enhances the military expenses the use benefit. The fifth chapter: Reality choice of equipment price control. Through to equips the price level the regulation, creates a stable just equipment price level to form the environment, in this foundation, to equips the price structure the stage, the process and the control method conducts the thorough research, by forms under a set of reasonable equipment price control method or the instruction mentality adapted current social economy condition.",1026923457, 装备价格控制方法研究,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, YiZhouYiZhou, Yi周毅", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715043011 , 70534652 , 189128 , H386179 , H386179", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 装备价格控制方法研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923457?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH386179 , Social sciences , control method , equipment , price , 价格 , 控制方法 , 装备",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Research+on+the+Control+of+%0A%0A%0A++++++++++++++++++the+Price+of+Equipment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Yi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Study on Training of the Rural Labor Force for Transferring under the Backgrounds of Urbanization,"In accordance with the general rules governing the development of urbanization, the building of a comfortable society and the realization of China's overall strategic objectives of the objective requirements, taking into account long-term residency system in the past under the influence of urbanization lags behind the store's huge potential, China is experiencing accelerating urbanization process.Speed up the process of rural urbanization of rural labor, the farmers need to objectively continuing education and vocational training in the human capital investment needs related to national public policy and system adjustments and innovation. The population movements and urbanization theory, human capital theory, immigrants adapt to social theory and the theory of the basic theoretical foundation, borrowed a large amount of related survey data, in the rural labor and urbanization and human capital relations basic posture on the basis of analysis from the urbanization of the state's macroeconomic objectives and coordinated urban and rural development, enterprise development and rural labor into cities, and as soon as the training of the various needs of rural labor, and government-related public policy arrangements, the main responsibility for identifying training, the training carrier supply, training and other related elements of the supply situation analysis training of rural labor ""supply-demand"" matching of a theoretical and practical assessment of the problem, based on this, identify problems and propose countermeasures recommendations. In the analysis of the key issues are explored under a dual household registration management system at the core of the macro background and goals as the main line to urbanization. Chapter 1 introduction, mainly on the background of this basic research and fundamental content The significance of the research background and the selection of subjects, some of the basic concepts related; the relevant documentation has been summarized; the theoretical basis; the data sources and basic research methods; the research framework; this innovative point and difficult. Chapter 2, urbanization background rural labor relations and the basic trend analysis of human capital Education, training, labor is the rational allocation of human resources development among the important ways, human capital formation and appreciation of the important channels. China between urban and rural, regional differences exist between the levels of socio-economic development of rural labor mobility is the driving force and foundation. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the rural labor force from rural areas to cities, from underdeveloped central and western regions to eastern especially in the southeast coastal region of the expanding scale. From the rural labor to junior middle school education level among the population as the main, they educated and trained labor force in rural areas is higher than the proportion of the overall level, but compared with the urban labor force is still low. Human capital stock of the current rural labor shortage is rural labor and urbanization of the main obstacles. Chapter 3, the rural labor training needs-analysis under the trend of Urbanization Training is due to the transfer of rural labor to urban labor market culture of quality and professional skills of the labor demand changes forward, leading to the supply of training. This part to the human capital theory, education equitable theory, the re-socialization theory as basic theoretical prop from industrialization, urbanization and coordinated urban and rural development objective needs from the ""workers shortage"", ""mechanic shortage"" and the sustainable development needs of enterprises and peasant workers from the city and plans to upgrade the capacity of the employment needs of individuals and urbanization several aspects proved the need for rural labor training; and further from the cities to farmers with low levels of personal qualities perspective analysis, add a peasant workers need training. Chapter 4, the transfer training supply-analysis of rural labor under the trend of Urbanization Supply is adequate and effective training and the transfer of rural labor to urban successful completion of the course an important guarantee for urban residents. Rural labor training is the key to the smooth development of the project funds. Rural labor training acts are external decisions of the rural labor training must be the main responsibility of the government, enterprises, farmers shared the personal and social forces. Currently, the policy level, government rural labor Although the importance of training has been profound understanding, but with our huge low-skill, low-quality transfer huge quantities of labor arising from the training needs compared carrier, finance, content and many other factors supply or demand factors all exhibited show the gap between supply and demand situation. Therefore, we must adopt a long-term effective mechanism to ensure the sustainable functioning of the training funds. Chapter 5, the rural labor training constraints analysis under the trend of Urbanization On the other hand, the systemic factors and individual farmers have also led to a lower quality of peasant workers mobility, low degree of organization, with low levels of employment-based stamina, This training also constitute the transfer of rural labor force certain constraints. Chapter6, Summary International experience and the Policy recommendations of China Through the training of rural labor supply and demand and constraints analysis for other countries to carry out the process of urbanization, rural labor training experience. To ensure that the urbanization of the rural labor training background to the smooth conduct of the work and planning target, the paper put forword to some advice. The major innovation may be following aspects: First,the training of peasant workers with significant investment is external nature. State intervention is the optimal solution to the supply of workers compensation feasibility external training is the solution. the State should be leading, but it is not entirely sense of investment-led training, more accurately refers to countries in the institutional arrangements and allocation of resources should take the lead responsibility. Second, the training of farmers made key factors that funding solutions: to increase the state of public finances in the meantime, special training through the establishment of rural labor to expand its training fund sources. Third, with the current government-led rural labor flow-oriented training model different from the equity and efficiency of this principle, should be established to make profit from the practice-oriented training model.

It only contacts the certain historical stage especially the primary stage of socialism, produces with formulation of socialist market economy, develops but develops, and withers away as it withers away. As the general form of value, the public capital is a kind of factor of production in conformity with large-scale social production, playing an irreplaceable role to the productivity development of the primary stage of socialism; And as the special form of value, the public capital reflect the double social relationships of "" the labor engages the capital and the capital engages the labor "" under the socialist market economy condition , it is "" cube barranca of Kraft "" that must be crossed in the socialist development process. This text divides six chapters altogether. Chapter one: the introduction, mainly introduces the reason, current situation, method and frame of the public capital studying, and has defined the public capital category. Understanding the public capital in the historical process of socialism movement, regarding the emergence, development of the public capital as the basic clue, finding the basic law of socialist market economic development, thus undertaking the historical mission of the theory worker of Marxism, it is our main reason of studying public capital. But as the speech of current situation of the studying on the public capital, the energy that the academia invests is far unbecoming to compare with the status of public capital as key category of socialist market economy. Studying the public capital, just as studying other social relationships, there is an academic position question, this is unavoidable as for researcher. We stand at Marxism position, use Marxist history and logic unified method and contradiction analytic approach study the public capital mainly; At the same time in order to avoid causing it through the dispute of the institute type as much as possible, used the analytic approach of the real example in a large amount too. Using these methods, we have investigated the public capital category, have analyzed the forming, producing, circulating, distributing, running and managing of the public capital, and sum up and analyze its contradiction on the basis of summarizing these practices, then analyze the development trend of the public capital further according to the public capital contradiction. This is basic train of thought and frame of this text. Coming to define in terms of its content, form and history regulation, the public capital is the capitalizing of public assets, it is the unifying organically of the public-owned content and capital form, it is the value that can bring surplus value to the socialist state and collective. It is the key category and peculiar category of the socialist market economy, only contacts the certain historical stage especially the primary stage of socialism, produces with formulation of socialist market economy, develops but develops, and withers away as it withers away . Chapter two: The forming of the public capital. Mainly research socialized gradual progress of the private capital and production of the public capital in the socialist state. Investigating the socialist movement from fact and the public capital in the historical process of socialist movement, we find two roads run parallel with: The socialization of private capital in developed capitalist nations and the production of public capital in socialist states whose economy and culture are relatively backward. Outwardly it seems that the two take their own roads, irrelevant at all, but they closely connect and influence each other in fact. As to historical order, formerly socializing of private capital in capitalist nations, producing of public capital in socialist state in after, the production of public capital walks abreast just with a certain stage of private capital socialization, and the socialization of private capital in developed capitalist nations form the background and external reason that public capital produce in socialist states of economy and culture relatively backward. Private capital, with the constant development of the large-scale social production, grow from ownership of the private capital to ownership of private share capital after going through one, and then reach the course of ownership of corporation share capital (namely corporation capital ownership ). The most obvious trend that this course embodies is the socialization day by day of the capital. And the final result of private capital socialization day by day must be “turning the capital into the public one which belongs to all social members' property”, “it will lose its class nature "". Public capital, the economic category which an author of a classic of Marxism had never involved, in the process of reform and opening-up of socialist state that economy and culture is relatively backward, under the background of fact that the private capital is socialized and the globalization process is accelerated day by day, arises at the historic moment as the setting-up of the socialist market economy system. Public capital, there is course of a primitive accumulation too. “Depriving depriver"", namely the private capital leaving over old China was changed into the socialist state-owned property; Leading and transforming the self-employed laborer, namely carries on the transformation to agriculture and private industry and commerce; Implementing the high accumulation rate, namely carries on "" depriving oneself "" of the socialism type; Through "" scissors difference"", by mending the worker's industrial policy agriculturally, the value was shifted from the agricultural surplus labor. The way of these public capital primitive accumulation, though not like the capitalist primitive accumulation was "" written into human annals with the characters of blood and fire "" like that, adopt ultra compulsive means of economy too , accumulate conditions of "" labor hires capital "" and "" capital hires labor "" within shorter time, namely to form the “ prehistory ” of public capital. Chapter three: The production, circulation and distribution of the public capital. Mainly research the universal law and special law of the production, circulation and distribution of public capital, as well as how to perfect the system that the public capital is produced, circulated and distributed. The production and circulation of the public capital follows the universal law of the production and circulation of the capital, and there is its own particularity too at the same time. Decided by the production of public capital, the distribution of public capital adopts the double level of distribution under socialist market economy, namely the mode combined distributing in money and distributing according to work, of which the first grade is distribution in money, the second is distribution according to work. The law that the public capital was produced, circulated and distributed, has reflected the basic state of circuitous development of public ownership under socialist market economy. Public capital production is the unity of work course and value multiplication course. In this course, not only the use value of meeting working people's needs, but also the surplus value of public capital has been produced. This is the characteristic of public capital production. For this reason, public assets turn into the public capital, it is the prerequisite that public capital is produced; the workforce turns into the goods under the socialist market economy condition, it is the prerequisite that public assets turn into the public capital. As value production, the public capital production must follow the universal law that value is produced. To encourage the enterprises to compete in the market, to mould public-owned enterprises into a qualified market main body, to set up modern enterprise system, to adjust the state-run economic layout and development strategy on the whole, it is an inevitable request that value is produced. The public capital circulation follows the universal law that the capital circulates, such as the circulation law of the capital, the turnover law of the capital and the law of that the means of production have priority to increase; and it has its own particularity too at the same time. Because of the decision of double goal of production and management, public capital circulation is not regulated all by surplus law of value and law of value. To the disposition of public capital resources, the planned mechanism will be used frequently besides using the market mechanism. Because of the special position and function of the public capital in our national economy, the flow, circulation of the public capital will exert an important influence on macro-economy operation. So to perfect the public capital circulation system, we must combine universal law and special law that the public capital circulates, must adhere to the scrupulous attitude to advance and retreat and structural adjustment of the public capital. We should follow the universal law of market economy, should consider the will of the people and the national conditions too. The distribution of the public capital is in the leading position under the socialist market economy condition in general capital distribution. The general capital distribution means the total distribution pattern of the national income under the socialist market economy condition, namely the distribution pattern of the total surplus value of public capital and private capital and laborer’s salary, its essence is to handle the country, enterprise and individual interests well. The general capital distribution is rational basically in our country, and the incomes of the country, enterprise and resident are balanced on the whole. But a lot of question are exposed and happened too at the same time, especially such that financial support is heavily different under different industry, so that some industries can not get very good development for a long time. And that the wage level of different trade draws heavy, this cause the society to pay close attention to fair problem. As regards itself, the distribution of public capital means the interests partition among the country or the collective and laborer. Because the relations between public capital and labor are double employer-employee relationships under the socialist market economy condition, namely relations that "" labor hiring capital-capital hiring labor "", so, the public capital distribution is divided into two levels accordingly: The first level is to assign according to the relation of "" capital hires labor "", namely the country obtained public surplus value in the capacity of investor, worker obtained salary in the provider's identity with the workforce. Therefore, the distribution of the first level is the distribution that is determined by the market mechanism, paying attention to efficiency. The second level is to reallocate according to the relation of “labor hires capital "", the united laborer realizes its right that asks for surplus value in the capacity of final owner. So the distribution of the second level is carried on in the form of macro adjustments and controls by the country, laying particular emphasis on the justice. According to the current situation of the public capital distribution, the publicly-owned enterprise's overall wage level advances by leaps and bounds since reform and opening-up, but the out-of-balance question of the structure exists too, wages level difference of different trade, different area are all greater, the public capital should solve the inside fair problem too when being distributed. The problem existing in the field of public capital distribution will be solved effectively only through perfecting public capital distribution system constantly. This kind of distribution system has already been different from public assets under planned economic system to distribute, also different from capital distribution in the capitalist country. We should pay attention to efficiency through the function of the market mechanism, as well as pay attention to justice through strengthening government regulating function in income distribution. How to set up efficient and fair distribution system, it is the big problem that we still need to probe further in practice. Chapter four: the operation and management of the public capital. Mainly research how to run and manage the public capital according to its essence and law. The problems of public capital in the course of producing, circulating and distributing, show evidently as how to operate and manage public capital at present. Public capital operation is to operate it according to the law that the public capital moves, to make the use of the public capital give play to the greatest efficiency. The main form of the public capital operation is the state-run capital operation. As the main respect of the public capital operation, the state-run capital operation regard improving the utilization benefit of the state-run capital as object, regard market mechanism as the basic means. It is a kind of operational and managerial activities that on the basis of the separation of two rights of state-run capital, the country proceeds from whole state-run economic development strategy as the investor, enterprises proceed from their own development strategy as the microcosmic main body, the two go on scientific plan and effective operation at different levels. However, the public capital operation is at its initial stage yet, there are still a lot of questions in practice, such that the public-owned enterprises are not complete market main bodies, the non market-oriented factors still exist; The capital market development is not perfect yet; Ignore the production and management, put undue emphasis on the capital operation; The social security system is still imperfect, etc.. In order to solve the problem that exist in the public capital operation, make the public capital operation more efficient with benefit, the most key one is to set up and perfect the supervision and management system of the public capital. While using experience of management of the foreign state-run capital for reference, to summarize the successful management mode appearing in the state-owned economy evolution of our country actively, basic train of thought has been proposed by the 16th National Congress that ""the central government and local government fulfils contributor’s duty on behalf of the country respectively "". According to this train of thought, the State Council passes through and issues ""the provisional administrative regulations of the supervision of enterprise's state-run assets”, which indicates that the state-run economic reform of our country develops from the stage of the definition of property right and the exploration of property right mode to the management stage of the public capital. Certainly, the regulation is only “interim regulation"", a lot of questions especially property right questions are still need to study and probe further in practice. Chapter five: public capital contradiction. Mainly research inherent contradiction, external contradiction and the rule of public capital development as well as the impact of the public capital contradiction on its production and running. The production, circulation, distribution, running and management of the public capital, is shown as circuitous advancement in practice, which is decided by the inherent contradiction of the public capital and limited by its external contradiction again at the same time. The inherent contradiction of the public capital is the contradiction of public-owned content and the capital form, and it stipulates the basic trend of the public capital development. The external contradiction of the public capital is the contradiction of public capital and private capital, and it plays a role in accelerating or delaying the development of the public capital. The expansion of the public capital inherent contradiction is its production, circulation, distribution, running and management, and the expansion of the public capital external contradiction is the concrete mode of the competition as well as cooperation between public capital and private capital. The inherent contradiction of public capital concentratedly embodies in the relation of a series of unity of opposites including non-exclusiveness and exclusiveness, social benefit and economic benefits, worker controlling the means of production and the means of production controlling worker, distribution according to work and distribution in money etc. Meanwhile, in two kinds of concrete forms of the public capital -- state-run capital and collective capital, the form of expression of these contradictions is different to some extent. The inherent contradiction of the public capital is having important influence on production and management of the public capital, because it is embodied in the contradiction of the ownership of the capital and the power of management in practice, namely the contradiction of who own the capital and who run the capital. This is exactly the key problem that we make sure progress but do not solved at all so far in our country socialist market economic development process. The external contradiction of the public capital includes two respects of belligerence and identity. As regards belligerence, it is the relation that the public capital and the private capital are distinguished and competed for, and there are obvious differences in the respects, such as the interests goal and way that the two are pursuing, the distribution method of surplus value and the relation of the two and working, and the capital accumulation way and trend, etc., at the same time the two are carrying on keen competition on the market as different interests main body. As to identity, it is the relation of interdependence, transfixion each other and transform each other between public capital and private capital, embodying in the cooperation on the market of two, such as participating in each other by shares, permeating each other, and the transformation of control power or the transformation of the capital form taking place when the condition is ripe. But the total trend is that the private capital turns into the public capital more and more, and in competing, the public capital studies experience of the private capital constantly, revises its own deficiency , thus improves and strengthens itself in the market competition rapidly, obtains more and more shareholding , and realizes the transition from expansion of quantity to qualitative leap finally, finishes this specific historical category of the public capital with revolutionary significance to deny itself, thus, the public ownership can be realized in more appropriate form on higher, more perfecting and riper level. Chapter six: the sublation of the private capital and expansion of the public capital. Mainly research the historical process of the self-sublation of private capital and the historical trend of the expansion of public capital. The two points to the same goal that socialism will replace capitalism finally through public capital replace private capital. The inexorable development trend of public capital contradiction is that the public capital denies the private capital and finally denies itself, and the private capital itself has a course self-denied. Development from the form of the private owner to the shareholding system form and then to the form of the state-run capital, has reflected the course that the private capital transforms from private capital to social capital with constant development of the large-scale social production. This transformation has relaxed the social contradiction of the capitalism, and has accumulated the condition for the new mode of production. However, it has not gone beyond the range of the private capital, so Marx calls this kind of transformation ""the passive sublation"". In the process of the self-sublation of the private capital, there has appeared in "" worker's own cooperative factory "" within the capitalist society, which can be regarded as a kind of economic form similar to the public capital, for it sublates the opposition between capital and labor, Marx calls this kind of sublation as ""the active sublation"". In the current international market, the position of the public capital is similar to that of the “cooperative factory"" in the capitalist domestic market. Though the public capital is still very small and weak can be regarded as it “the first breach that old form is open in the old form "", there are far-reaching meanings. The expansion of capital is the natural instinct of it. The expansion of the private capital promotes the process of the economic globalization, which makes the capitalism grow from country's monopoly capitalism to international monopoly capitalism, and these form the international background that public capital monopolizes with the competition. Through summarizing the historical law of capital development, we can find that monopoly, despite the negative effect of suppressing the technological progress, is one chapter that must be written in the history of the capital. It is the centralized inevitable outcome of production, yet conversely promotes production to be centralized further again. It is the catalyst which makes capital socialized to form the extensive capital, and conversely the socialized capital often accumulates the condition that monopoly expands. Monopoly squeezes but does not eliminate the competition, the competition between the monopolies is larger, the degree is fiercer. The modes of the profit of monopoly are ""ed leave metrically together"" as monopoly develops till today, on the one hand it obtaining monopoly profits relying on its monopoly position, on the other hand speeding up technological development to keep its leading advantage in the trade. So, while seeing negative consequence monopolized at the present age, we should see its function as the social capital catalyst objectively too. The public capital must allow “rational monopoly”, the domestic monopoly facing the international monopoly capital, if the public capital wants to form the enterprises colony analogous to the scale of the capital to participate in the international competition. The purpose that we maintain the “rational monopoly” of public capital is to accelerate the speed of accumulation of the public capital, make it rank among the ranks of the transnational group quickly, as many as possible as much as possible. But the public capital has just come into being, and still in transforming, it also mainly lays particular emphasis on inside merger at present, so the strategy of implementing “walking out "" will be a very long course. Even so, but paces that the public capital expands will not stop. The motive force that the public capital expands depends on the pursuit of publicly-owned surplus value and pressure of the market competition, yet the trend that the public capital expands depends on the development of inherent contradiction and external contradiction of the public capital. So, the dialectical movement course in practice of contradiction of the public capital is the historical course naturally of public capital accumulation, and the historical course that the public capital expands constantly as the ones that accumulate go on continuously. And with the development of contradiction movement of the public capital, the accumulation of the public capital will develop in the unity of twists and advancement too, and the public capital will demonstrate certain wave accordingly too in its expansion. And just in the course of such dialectical development, the public capital will sublate itself constantly, also sublate the private capital in the course of expansion of it at the same time, until finish its historical mission and exit from socialist stage of economic history.",1026923908, 论公有资本,Dissertations & Theses," Zheng, Hua DongZhengDongHuaZheng, Hua Dong郑东华", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715045961 , 70534732 , 189128 , H391631 , H391631", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 论公有资本,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923908?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH391631 , Social sciences , private capital , public capital , socialist market economy , 公有资本 , 社会主义市场经济 , 私有资本",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+Public+Capital&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zheng%2C+Hua+Dong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on Merchandising Rights,"Along with the economical development, the entire society's commercialized phenomenon is day by day prominent, the symbol or their union which the commercialized power is can create the populace to expend the character or the animal role, the image, the famous work name or the fragment which demand, the human knows widely and so on carries on the commercial character use the rights. This article has profited from in the civil law the civil rights basic principle, to commercialized, the commercialized power as well as the correlation question has carried on the analysis, and proposed to the commercialized power protection the suggestion, had pointed out originates is suitable the different protection method for the different domain commercialized power. The this article main content divides into four chapters, specifically as follows: First chapter main elaboration commercialization power (merchandising rights) the basic concept, settles the discussion the foundation. Must understand the commercialized power must to the commercialization (merchandising) the connotation has the profound understanding. The commercialized movement origins in American Disney Corporation to serves under somebody's banner the animation movie the role two commercial characters development, like applies in the clothing, the toy, food and so on the many kinds of commodities thus obtains the huge profit. The commercialization ""actually is a dynamic process, it involves to the knowledge property"" the second development use ""(secondary exploitation) the question. They own activity and the performance domain are quite widespread, like fashionable clothing domain, movie television and radio broadcasting domain, artistic domain, sports domain, music domain, political domain, sphere of learning, religious domain and charitable organization domain and so on. Had understood the commercialization may further understand the commercialized power. The commercialized power begins in traditional in the personality power privacy case, in US, The rights of privacy origin may trace the paper which roentgen and Buland Teece wrote to 1890 time passages about the privacy rights. To 60's, The Japanese judicature and the theory and call it ""the commercialized power"" (merchandising rights) this rights concept introduction. In the our country present law standard system still did not have ""the commercialized power"" this specific rights concept, The correlation research start is late, Also owes thorough and is comprehensive. Has not unified the understanding to the commercialized power scope, approximately some two viewpoints: One is the narrow sense vivid power, Namely mainly is refers to these in the commercial activity using the celebrity image sole right to have the substantive personality characteristic factor the image, Like name, portrait, signature, sound and so on. Two is the generalized on vivid power. This category besides containing narrow sense vivid power content, Also advocated these with have the life characteristic to relate with difficulty, But also has the commercial development value in the opinion the content (for example, Armor A, has the special meaning the numeral and so on) also to be possible to include in the role commercialization power extent of protection. To commodity speech power nature then has ""the copyright to say"", ""a kind of copyright said"", ""the goodwill power said"", ""the synthesis said"" and so on the view. Meets down the author through the analysis ""the Lu Xun right of portrait case"", ""five artificial flowers with gold-foil cases"", ""three wools rights of portrait case"" and so on the typical case elaborated our country establishes the commercialized power system the necessity and the urgency. Second chapter further carries on to the commercialized power thoroughly sets at variance, through the analysis commercialization power carrier, the object, the main body, the content penetrates the understanding commercialization power. Commercialized power carrier in different concept quite same not less than, During but rests on the common factor to be possible to comb a similar concentric circle the pattern: The core is in the work role, The inferior outer layer is the honorable person image, Human body image, The most outer layer is the specific meaning which the work title, the language fragment as well as the public knew very well symbolized, the character acts, the mark and so on. The author thought into the commercialized power the object should have the unique significance, known by everybody the nature, community nature, conforms with moral customs. Above 4 conditions concealed validity, Is only the illustration, The uncertain each object all must have. The commercialized power main body may have the different division way according to the different standard. May divide into the pure main body and the multi-skill main body according to the main body complexity; According to obtains the way to be possible to divide into the primitive main body with to continue the main body The commercialized power right content mainly contains accumulates the totalitarian authority with to disappear the totalitarian authority. Accumulates the totalitarian authority is the subject of object may transfer the commercialized power or award the permission, The transfer may be the complete right, Also may be the partial rights. Disappears the totalitarian authority mainly is refers exercises forbids other people illegally the right which seeks profit using the image. In the synthesis 4 aspects set at variance the analysis to the commercialized power, The author thought the commercialized power is refers has the unique significance, the public knowned by everybody the nature, can cause the public cognition real to be vivid, the hypothesized image and its the characteristic mark, the movement urgently needs in profit-oriented the use appropriation right. The third chapter main elaboration commercialization power distinguishes between other intellectual property rights places. First, the commercialization does as a temporary measure the new right which only then appears for on century's end, Its nature is the generalized intellectual property rights but the non- real right and the creditor's rights. Does as a temporary measure the commercialization for the intellectual property rights protects, Conforms to ""Establishment Knowledge of the world Property right Organization Joint pledge"" principle. ""Joint pledge"" 2nd 8th section , ""Comes from the right all other which the industry, the science and literary arts domain intelligence creation produces"" to define as the intellectual property rights. Defines from this looked, The commercialized power is in among. At present, Many developed countries have tended to the commercialized power bring into line with the intellectual property rights category. Meets down through the comparison commercialization power and the copyright, the trademark rights similarity analyzes three boundaries. The commercialized power and the copyright difference lies in has the condition to be different; The protection object scope is different, also has the overlapping part, also has the different part; The commercialized power and the copyright have the object which occurs together (or carrier) the extent of protection, but two powers are not same; The commercialized power does not have and the copyright limit same limit, therefore in the right infringement judgment, two also has the difference. The commercialized power and the trademark rights also have the obvious difference in certain aspects, like two in the protection goal, the protection object, the extent of protection and the existence domain has the difference; Two in obtains in the right procedure also to have the difference; Two rights institutes and the scope and the influence is different; Two powers both may sum up for the appropriation right of use and are durable the power, but two kind of powers scopes size is not same, in the commercialized power appropriation right of use with is durable the power scope is same, but in the trademark rights appropriation right of use with is durable the power scope not to be same, is durable the power scope to be bigger than the appropriation right of use scope. Fourth rules key elaboration commercialization power protected mode, thus protected the commercialized power to our country to provide the precious model and the experience. First sees here and there to the well-known image protection in each right system, but protects the well-known vivid owner or the inventor has the control and gains the commercial interest from this image the right, prevented other people use in this well-known vivid commercial arbitrarily the use, already for the international joint pledge and two big legal systems universal approvals, and becomes the various countries law development the tendency. Next has analyzed separately regarding the role commercialization power and the natural person commercialization power these two kind of different commercialization power type different protected mode: Regarding the role commercialization power may through way and so on copyright law, personal rights law, trademark law and anti-unfair competition law protects; The natural person commercialization power is also called the vivid power, regarding vivid power nature, First may the affirmation be, It is one kind of property rights; As a result of modern commodity economy development and public wealth shape change, Property more and more many diastrophisms are invisible and the non- matter. Therefore, Should establish in the civil law study research to be bigger than the intellectual property rights scope the immaterial goods property right system, By contains all the right which produces based on the non- material shape, The image was expedient may place oneself in. The author also initially discussed the vivid power right-owners scope, has been protected the personality essential factor the scope and the commercial use scope. Under through the analysis copyright law, the personality power law, the trademark law, the exclusive law and the anti-unfair competition protection commercialization power limitation draws out our country to establish the independent commercialized power advantageous place Establishes the independent commercialized power to be possible to maintain the well-known vivid economic, Provides the economy for the inventor to stimulate, Promotion knowledge and creative work production, Also may through prevent not right competes the behavior occurrence, Protects the personal interest and the social benefit, This is the commercialized right policy foundation; At the same time additionally builds the commercialized power to be advantageous to the realization law to the social relations adjustment, the establishment commercialization power, By beforehand adjusts the integral expression the pattern hypothesis positive right, Is the market behavior standardization needs to set up the commercialized power, And stipulated its may constitute in first the power, Has become the various countries law development the tendency; Hypothesis commercialization power, Also is strengthens legal the transparency, Directs the market main body to the market behavior forecast and the appraisal, Standard market main body behavior, Maintains the market order the urgent need.

It is an important supporting system for human life maintaining and sustainable social development. Seafloor hydrothermal system no only have potential tremendous economic value but also have the active significance for research in physical movement in deep earth, tectonic activities, plate movement and origin of life. Nowadays, subjects of marine science, geology and biology face the same mission of investigation of seafloor hydrothermal system. Upon the support of State 863 Program, a set of geochemical sensor with independent intellectual property containing reference electrode, pH electrode, H2S electrode and dissoloved oxygen electrode is prepared for in-situ detecting on seafloor. It is useful to help people study hydrothermal system from geological, chemical, biological and other aspects, and thus greatly promote research in the field of sea resources detecting, sea environment observation and protection, and marine science. After studying in existing geochemical sensor and comparing previous preparation methods of these electrodes at home and aboard, the methods are taken as following: using noble metal as basic material, realizing the solidification and micromation of detecting electrodes; using AgCl melt to make reference electrode, enhancing its lifetime; using epoxy resin with ultra thin silver power as the middle layer to prepare Ag/Ag2S electrode, enhancing its detecting limit; using Na2O2 melt to prepare Ir/IrO2 electrode coated with Nafion, a kind of proton selective substance produced by DuPon, enhancing its resistance ability; using Au coated with DePeX membrane as DO electrode, enhancing its liftime and detecting ability. Constantly improve the electrodes performance by experimental calibrations according to the feedback. As a collaboration project between Zhejiang University and the University of Minnesota, a joint team has been working together on in-situ geochemical sensors for seafloor hydrothermal system. The device had been working continuously in a microbial cluster near TICA-vent for about 12 days and realized long-term chemical compositon monitoring for the first time in this area. Time-series records show that temperature fluctuates between 10C and 20.5C, and total dissolved varies from 7.4 to 27.3 mol/L. Through the analysing results of detecting data, it is found that temperature and chemical component concentration change periodically could be refered to tide influence. As a universal technical platform, in-situ geochemical sensor can be used widely. It has great potential applications in natural gas hydrate detecting, seabed observation system and other fields. Research results in this paper can reduce the gap in deep seafloor resources investigation technology between China and western countries and lay a sound foundation for deep-sea mineral resources investigation, exploration and exploitation.",1027080421, 海底原位地球化学传感器的研制及应用,Dissertations & Theses," Huang, XiaHuangXiaHuang, Xia黄霞", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715944661 , 70643322 , 189128 , H429120 , H429120", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 海底原位地球化学传感器的研制及应用,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027080421?accountid=14496, 0372 Geology, 0372 Geology, 0372 Geology,, 0372 Geology, Geology," (UMI)AAIH429120 , Earth sciences , 海底原位地球化学传感器、Ag/AgCl参比电极、Ag/Ag2S电极、Ir/IrO2电极、溶解氧电极、热液硫化物、天然气水合物、海底观测系统",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Preparation+and+application+of+in-situ+geochemical+sensors+on+seafloor&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huang%2C+Xia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Law Text and Jurisditonal Practice,"Kin-relationship Volum of Civil Law of the Repblic of China is the achievement in massive law-making after the foundation of the Nanjing Guomingtang government and the first law on kinship relationship enacted and cariied out during the modern times in China. Its revised version is still in effect in Taiwan even today. Law text is enriched with its historical and cultural connotations. Therefore, through the analytical reading of a certain law text, we can not only deepen the understanding of the forms it takes in a given historical period but also can dicover the interactions between politics, economy and cuture at that time by means of searching into the historical background of the law-making. The issues Kin-realtionship Law concerns are mostly minor issues that closely related to the life of common citizens. In this sense, Kin-relationship law is actually a mirror reflecting the reality of civil society, i.e.the life of common citizens. Kin-relationship Law of a certain historical period is able to reflect the ethical and moral orientations of people at that time. From the narration of law texts, which are usually ignored by researchers, a “civil society”expressed by the law-makers can be reconstructed. It is possible that there is distance between this “civil society”tainted withlaw-makers’ subjective experience and the real one. Yet it is the distance which this paper focuses on, that is, the issue of how national law interacts with civil society. A study of Kin-relationship Volum of Civil Law of the Repblic of China from this perspective will bring new insights into the legal system during the rule of Nanjing Guomingtang government. Compared with the static texts oflaw,jurisdictional practice is much more complex. If a volume of law texts is to be effective, it is not only associated with the quality of jurisdical system and other relevant power structures but also with the legal consciousness of citizens and the expertise of juridical workers. As Pan Guangdan states: “The management of things partially results from manpower and partially from the interlocking and constraining factors of its environment. Manpower, which is undoubtedly part of the interlocking and constraining factors, is nothing more than that.If things are dissociated from the other interlocking and constraining factors except manpower which becomes the sole controlling factor; things will be perverted in its forms and exhausted its potentiality. ” Therefore, through the study of law texts and jurisdictional practice, various changes during the process when the static law texts are carried out in juridical actions can be revealed. The introduction part focuses on perspective and methodology employed in the paper. Under guidance of “descriptive” and “explanative” principle, Kin-relationship law is explored from the perspective of jurisprudence, history, sociology as well as anthropology. Chapter Two includes the historical retrospect of the law-making on kin-relationship laws in traditional Chinese society, its basic features as well as the changes it undergoes with the political, economical, and cultural development of modern Chinese society. The legal development of any society and time is deeply rooted in its given society. Consequently, the profound and precise explanation of a certain law can only be obtained from the understanding of its historical back ground. Kin-relationship Volum of Civil Law of the Repblic of China is no exception. The following five aspects are the backgrounds and factors that influenced the law-making: first, the great political and economical changes in China since late Qing Dynasty; second, the necessity for the withdrawal of exterritoriality; third, the pressure imposed by the thinking and practice of Women’s Liberation Movement; fourth, the requirement of the creed and constitution of Guomingtang; lastly, the new trend in the law-making of Kin-relationship laws at the beginning of the 20th century. At the same time, the central political committee of Guomingtang demanded that “Three Principles of the People”, as the ideology of Guomingtang, be planted in the lawmaking. As a result, it is equally important to be clear about the legal connotations of“Three Principles of the People” as well as its significance to the design of the legal system of the Kin-relationship Volum of Civil Law of the Repblic of China. Generally speaking, the legal system of Kin-relationship Volum consists of marriage system and kinship system. this paper, with an eye on the marriage customs of the common citizen, explores deep into the original intention for the design of the legal system and the distance between the national law Kin-relationship Volum and the customs of the populace. at the same time, the paper analysizes the cause for the distance: the dilemmatic choice law-makers faced between the transplantation of western laws and employment of native laws. Because of factors in and outside the country, overdue emphasis was put on catching up with the latest international trend in law-making when concrete jurisdiction clauses were made. As a consequence, although the legal system is trendy, it is far from enough to meet the practical need of the populace. As the Chinese poem expresses, “the man inside the Mountain Lu can never get a panoramic view of it.” It is the same case with the study of law texts. The comparison of one law text with another one may provides a new perspective. This paper compares comprehensively the Kin-relationship Volum with the marriage and family laws in the Revolutionary Bases of the same period in fpour aspects, namely, lawmaking techniques and codes of law, legal language, basic content and the actual effect. In addition, the paper analyses the differences between the two and reflects on them. The jurisdictional practice of Kin-relationship Volumis is also a key point in the study. It is dealt in two parts. Part one studies how Kin-relationship Volum was carried out in jurisdictional practice by analyzing the civil verdicts of the Supreme Court of Nanjing Guomingtang government and those of local courts like chengdu. Did the jurisdical workers settle marriage and family issues according to legal principle and concrete clauses of Kin-relationship Volum? Were there any problems occurring during the process? what factors caused the problems? These are the questioned discussed in the paper. Part two investigates the interactive relationship between Kin-relationship Volum in its jurisdictional practice and the social customs of common citizens. As a law that addresses the “private affairs”of common people, it can not escape from the influence of social customs. While customs are having their effect on Kin-relationship Volum, the law is also has its direct impact on social customs: confirming, normalizing and reinforcing customs that are consistent with the social development while reforming, eliminating and expelling harmful customs among the citizens. As the first modern marriage law in China, it is problematic, to some extent, in both its legal text and its jurisdictional practice. However, to gain the correct knowledge of these problems, it is wiser to view them in the larger historical context during the rule of Nanjing Guomingtang government. The occurrence of any historical phenomena can not be simple explained in an “either-or” way. Therefore, while studying Kin-relationship Volum ，without probing deep into the legal system of law, researchers should avoid the tendency to jump to a hasty denial results from the ideological influence that the law is made by the government representative for the interests of landlords and bourgeoisie.",1027906027, 法律文本与司法实践：《中华民国民法•亲属编》研究,Dissertations & Theses," Li, GangLiGangLi, Gang李刚", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2721243851 , 70527002 , 189128 , H224909 , H224909", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 法律文本与司法实践：《中华民国民法•亲属编》研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027906027?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH224909 , Social sciences , Kin-relationship Volum of Civil Law of the Repblic of China , Nanjing Guomingtang Government , marital and familial customs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Law+Text+and+Jurisditonal+Practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Gang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The study of Chinatown as an urban artifice and its impact on the Chinese community in London,"Sociologists claim that the ethnic Chinese community in the United Kingdom cannot be spatially defined. The first reason is that the widely scattered Chinese catering businesses-still the main source of employment for incoming Chinese migrants - makes the Chinese community too dispersed to form residential enclaves. Secondly, the evasive nature of the ethnic Chinese population towards government assistance and strong sense of ethnic solidarity also makes them an ""invisible community"". The Confucian philosophy governing their way of life further reinforces patrilineal links oriented towards ancestral villages in China. Recent renewed interests in the future of London's Chinatown as the result of a recent development plan has prompted this report to investigate whether a spatial pattern of occupation by the Chinese community exists in Chinatown, or if it is simply an intelligent urban artifice exploited for touristic and commercial purposes. Unlike its historical East End predecessor which has never been exclusively Chinese, present day London Chinatown can be qualified as a ""persistent enclave"". Whilst it crucially accommodates co-ethnic businesses and facilities for the oriental population, it is not the sole centre for the Chinese community. At the outset, studies on the Chinese have been confounded by their lack of assimilation into host society, inconsistent methods of data representation from the population census and high levels of suspicion by the immigrant community when conducting fieldwork. By first understanding historical developments in London's two Chinatowns and concepts pertaining to Chinese ethnography, this helps substantiate the demographic data, changing land use and household occupation by the Chinese community in Limehouse around 1890 and Soho today. The global and local relationship for these two areas are also analysed syntactically through spatial maps derived from Booth's Map of Poverty of 1889 and a current axial map of London respectively. The spatially-oriented case study of Soho's Chinatown identifies through a public survey a collective mental representation of its neighbourhood area that differs from its administrative designation. Pedestrian movement studies suggest that there is a distinct spatial and temporal pattern of occupation amongst the ethnic Chinese which differs from non-Chinese tourists and locals which can be syntactically measured. The findings support the view that a complex social and spatial relationship exists between the two disparate groups that utilise Chinatown. Whilst its commercial success is crucial to maintaining Chinatown's public profile, it also allows it to continue to function as an important centre for the Chinese community.",1040636260,,Dissertations & Theses," Chung, S.S.-Y.ChungS.S.-Y.Chung, S.S.-Y.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2762568711 , 64927081 , 101309 , U571771 , U571771 , http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/14192/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1040636260?accountid=14496, 0729 Architecture, 0729 Architecture, 0729 Architecture,, 0729 Architecture, Architecture," http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/14192/ , (UMI)AAIU571771 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+study+of+Chinatown+as+an+urban+artifice+and+its+impact+on+the+Chinese+community+in+London&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chung%2C+S.S.-Y.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The impact of climate change on the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals related to malaria,"Today, climate change is a major issue discussed by the media worldwide.

This paper investigates how climate change will affect the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 6, in relation to malaria, in sub-Saharan Africa. The study is conducted as a literature review, where secondary data has been analysed. Malaria is believed to be directly affected by climate change through a rise in temperature and change in rainfall patterns. Both parasite and vector are dependent on temperature to develop, while water is needed for breeding. Less research has been conducted on the indirect effects of climate change on malaria. Some of the predicted results of climate change are drought, food shortages, conflicts and population movement. These consequences will most likely increase humans’ risk of being infected with malaria. Based on Breman’s (2001) framework, a new framework has been developed where the effects of climate change are taken into consideration. The framework show the convergence between climate change and increased malaria burden through extrinsic determinants; environmental conditions, social and behavioural factors, and economical and political factors. With global warming the world could see a retreat away from the Millennium Development Goals. In order to reduce the worst impact, greenhouse gases need to be cut, health infrastructure strengthened and international interventions towards malaria reduction need to adapt to a changing environment.",1221963082,,Dissertations & Theses," Pettersen, L.

The initial chapters present a description of the socio-historical context in Mexico and of the EZLN as a social movement.  Chapters III and IV describe the theoretical methodological framework of the thesis, which integrates a Gramscian approach to hegemony with discursive theory and two main directions in critical discourse analysis (CDA): discourse and social change and the discourse-historical approach.  Categories of the discourse theory have been connected to categories in CDA, thus creating a framework which allows for the analysis of data in the light of a hegemonic struggle. The analysis helps to clarify concepts in discourse theory, especially ‘empty signifiers’, ‘nodal points’, ‘myth’ and ‘imaginary’.  The integration of discourse theory and CDA makes possible an analysis of the discourse of the Mexican government and the EZLN in terms of processes of re-articulation.  Thus, Salinas de Gortari rearticulates the national future of Mexico in terms of civic nationalism and liberal democracy; and the EZLN in terms of ethnic nationalism and a radical democracy.  The final chapters discuss the stakes in this conflict and consider it in terms of the struggle, on the part of the EZLN, for the right to be different.",1314564162,,Dissertations & Theses," Montesano Montessori, Nicholina Maria LuisaMontesano MontessoriMaria LuisaNicholinaMontesano Montessori, Nicholina Maria Luisa", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907788721 , 64960171 , 101309 , U559197 , U559197", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314564162?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," 525334 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+discursive+analysis+of+the+struggle+for+hegemony+between+the+ejercito+zapatista+de+liberacion+nacional+%28+ezln%29+and+the+mexican+government&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Montesano+Montessori%2C+Nicholina+Maria+Luisa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Imagining 'home': Korean migrant women's identities in the UK,"This thesis examines how individual women's desires and social situations can trigger migration as well as the complex and multifaceted effects of geographical mobility on women's lives and the formation of their identities. As a growing number of people move across national boundaries and the range of contemporary migration channels have opened to new breadths, an understanding of current migration practice needs to consider one's specific status within a wide range of types. Through the case of Korean migrant women in the UK, this research challenges the simple assumption of migrants as people who move for only economic purposes as well as the victimisation and homogenisation of Asian migrant women. Based on in-depth individual interviews and a targeted ethnography of Korean communities in the UK, this study explores the experiences of Korean migrant women. The research uses the conceptual framework of ""home"" and is grounded on the belief that ""home"" is paradoxically matched with movement rather than a fixed and stable place. The findings suggest that these women's home-making is related to various power relations such as gender relations in contemporary Korea, public attitudes to immigrants and ethnic minorities in the UK, and Korean settlement patterns in the UK. This thesis reveals that the idea of the cosmopolitan/global citizen is promoted to women as a desirable lifestyle and can motivate their migration. Yet these women face certain disjunctions-between the fantasy and the reality of living in the UK; their own self-images and others' stereotypes of them; traditional assumptions about immigrants and their actual lives. Through managing these disjunctions and reshaping their relationships with their families, localities and nation, these women's migration often challenges the traditional binary gender division of masculine- public-outside-work vs. feminine-private-inside-home.",1626374036,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Young JeongKimJeongYoungKim, Young Jeong", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3502185291 , 91895002 , 189128 , 9781321357059 , U615991 , U615991", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781321357059, English, English,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1626374036?accountid=14496, 0631 Ethnic studies, 0631 Ethnic studies, 0631 Ethnic studies,, 0631 Ethnic studies, Ethnic studies," (UMI)AAIU615991 , Social sciences , Immigrants , Korean women , United Kingdom",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+%27home%27%3A+Korean+migrant+women%27s+identities+in+the+UK&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Young+Jeong&amp;isbn=9781321357059&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Exploring union renewal in france: an ethnographic study of union activists in sud-rail,"This thesis considers the nature and extent of union renewal in France through an ethnographic case study of the breakaway trade union movement 'Fidiration des Syndicats Solidaires, Unitaires et Dimocratiques' more commonly known as SUD. The research was conducted in a local level union of SUD-Rail, a union which emerged in the French public railway sector in 1996 from an ideological split with one of France's largest trade union confederations, the Confidiration Franqaise Dimocratique du Travail (CFDT). As with other SUD trade unions, SUD-Rail emerged with the stated aims to renew and revitalize French trade unionism. In the context of trade union decline and even 'crisis', this research considers to what extent and how the union was able to extend its membership base, replenish activists, maintain links with workers and develop and sustain collective organisation, interests and identity, in spite of the external and internal constraints. The research presents a thick description of trade unionism at the local level and the findings show how activists make attempts to confront and renew existing practices and structures in trade unionism. Overall, the evidence suggests that, in support of existing research on SUD trade unions in various sectors, there has been a partial renewal of trade unionism in the railway sector from the emergence of SUD-Rail. SUD-Rail has been able to influence the industrial relations context and challenge existing trade union identities, practices and organisation. The union has been able to organise previously unorganised workers, replenish activist members and combine an engagement in local as well as more global issues. The research demonstrates how this was achieved through a continuous set of frame alignment processes where activists sought to legitimise and encourage some level of support in the union. However, this research brings to light the tensions in the approach adopted by the SUD unions. To an extent the union could be seen to be reproducing features of the very form of unionism that it sought to confront, including low membership levels and tendencies towards institutionalisation and bureaucracy. This research shows that there are limits to renewal and revitalization which reflect the context of industrial relations and traditions in trade unionism in France. However, they also reflect the universal and perennial dualisms within trade unionism between democracy and bureaucracy and between movement and organisation. This research has shown how these tensions are dealt with in the day-to-day of activities in SUD-Rail. This thesis contributes an in-depth study of the social processes of developing and sustaining trade union renewal in France. The research develops the union renewal debate by helping to further understand how the choices and actions of actors mediate and influence the processes towards building and sustaining collective organisation and identity. The thesis demonstrates the utility of the framing processes concept for organising and analysing the ways in which collective interests and identity are or are not developed and sustained, which has important implications for the prospects of building and sustaining trade union renewal.",1685019974,,Dissertations & Theses," Connolly, Heather MargaritaConnollyMargaritaHeatherConnolly, Heather Margarita", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3702141561 , 96494892 , 101309 , U635425 , U635425 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2852/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685019974?accountid=14496, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0510 Economics, Economics," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2852/ , (UMI)AAIU635425 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+union+renewal+in+france%3A+an+ethnographic+study+of+union+activists+in+sud-rail&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Connolly%2C+Heather+Margarita&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The road to peace: the role of the southern sudanese church in communal stabilisation and national resolution,"This thesis examines the part played by Christian churches in the communal stabilisation of three refugee settings and in the national resolution of the second Sudanese civil war. Based on extensive field research in Sudan and in Sudanese refugee camps in Kenya and Uganda, the thesis is further underpinned by current theories on displacement, social identity and conflict resolution. Ranging from grassroots pastors to Presidential Cabinet Ministers, altogether more than one hundred fifty church and political leaders were consulted through individual interviews and focus groups with more than seventy-five recorded hours. Archives at The Centre for Documentation and Advocacy in Nairobi, Kenya, the New Sudan Council of Churches’ Archive in Kampala, Uganda, the Sudan Archive at the University of Durham, United Kingdom and the Hudson Institute in Washington D.C., United States were also utilised. The thesis commences with an examination of three grassroots communities in refuge, Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya, the internally displaced of Hajj Yusuf, Khartoum and Oliji Refugee Camp in Uganda. In establishing the social impact and influence of the churches on the respective displaced community, each of the three local manifestations function as a case study detailing endeavours by Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Catholic and Pentecostal churches to respond to arisen needs, resolve political instabilities and reconcile ethnic tensions. Though the exact influence of the churches differs in each context one overarching theme that emerges is greatly enhanced communal stabilisation. Alongside the numerical growth and social impact of the churches at the local level, the ecumenical New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) employed a three-tiered strategy to facilitate national resolution of the second civil war as is delineated in the second half of the thesis. First, through ‘the people-to-people peace process’ the NSCC directly mediated grassroots reunification throughout southern Sudan. Second, the NSCC functioned as the primary channel of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) criticism and utilised its growing clout to pressure the SPLM/A to adopt measures of good governance and pursue in good faith negotiated settlement with the Government of Sudan. Third, the NSCC stood behind a successful international campaign that lobbied and secured engagement from regional and European and American governments critical to the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. By paralleling three local communities and the NSCC national resolution initiatives the thesis proffers several important conclusions about Christianity and the civil war in south Sudan including enumerating rationales related to the explosive growth of Christianity, demarcating several nascent indicators of a Christian influenced civil religion, highlighting the growing social and political impact of the churches throughout south Sudan and finally, delineating several general conflict mediatory keys relevant to the churches’ endeavours. The thesis furthermore clearly demonstrates that in the midst of civil war the southern Sudanese indigenous churches bolstered communal stabilisation at a grassroots level, substantively impacted the emergence of national political resolution and thereby directly facilitated the road to Sudanese peace.",1774212520,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, Elijah M.BrownM.ElijahBrown, Elijah M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989186901 , 102694852 , 101309 , 10030126 , 10030126 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/3260", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774212520?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/3260 , (UMI)AAI10030126 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+road+to+peace%3A+the+role+of+the+southern+sudanese+church+in+communal+stabilisation+and+national+resolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Elijah+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The social construction of disabling identities: severely visually impaired children in lebanon,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the current Lebanese social policy and practices concerning disabled children in general and visually impaired children in particular on the social construction of disabling identities. This is relevant to current national and global disability rights movements, which infrequently take children and their specific issues into consideration. It is particularly pertinent to Lebanon which passed its first rights-based disability law in 2000 and continues to struggle with its implementation. This study was conducted through an organisational ethnography of a residential institution for children with severe visual impairments and was supplemented by interviews with the children, some members of their families, teachers, staff and alumni from the institution, as well as participant observation sessions at integrative settings, and interviews with parents and activists pursuing inclusion. The analysis focused on investigating the inclusionary versus exclusionary nature of policy and practice; the availability of mechanisms allowing for children's participation in these contexts; and the impact of these practices on the self-identities of disabled children. Theoretically, the analysis built on current literature in disability studies and the sociology of childhood, as well as drawing on Foucauldian ideas of power, control and surveillance and applying Goffman's concepts of stigma and the concept of a total institution. The findings show that rights based legislation cannot on its own result in inclusive changes of policy and practice. In the absence of implementation mechanisms, practices remain predominantly exclusionary, with no effective mechanisms for the meaningful participation of parents or children, eventually socialising the children into disabled identities. Children 8 - 12 years of age were not exhibiting any noticeable resistance to the systems of control, and had adopted the discriminatory values relating to disability exhibited around them.",1780155377,,Dissertations & Theses," Damaj, Maha GhaziDamajGhaziMahaDamaj, Maha Ghazi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018629441 , 103018892 , 101309 , 10087462 , 10087462 , http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/1300447/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780155377?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/1300447/ , (UMI)AAI10087462 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+social+construction+of+disabling+identities%3A+severely+visually+impaired+children+in+lebanon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Damaj%2C+Maha+Ghazi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Spectacular political experiments: the constitution, mediation and performance of large-scale public participation execises","Foremost in contemporary debates about democratic renewal and the re-engagement of citizens in the polity are concerns about publicness and the modes of politics that may be suited to this task. In this thesis case studies of three large-scale public participation exercises are presented: a local governmental exercise; a national popular media initiative and a transnational/translocal social movement event. Engaging with these cases the research explores three, ostensibly different, approaches to and settings of engagement. The study utilises a mix of discourse analysis and participant observation to engage with different features of each case. The outcome of this analysis is an exposition of the forms of publicness and the modes of politics that are summoned up, articulated, negotiated and enacted through the performance of these exercises. Comparing the three cases the thesis then develops two interrelated lines of argument. First, because of a set of tensions inscribed into the ideas of the public summoned up in each setting, the publics of these exercises are characterised as paradoxical publics. And, secondly, the mode of politics privileged across the three settings is characterised as spectacular and experimental. The findings of this research problematise the idea that large scale public participation exercises might somehow enact forms of politics that are more direct. The study also challenges the assumption that such practices might enable publics to act more authentically. Through a consideration of the relationships between a diverse, if limited, sample of contemporary large-scale public participation exercises this study instead contributes to the emerging politics of public mediation.",1795947855,,Dissertations & Theses," Mahony, NickMahonyNickMahony, Nick", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4087032141 , 46396031 , 101309 , U519748 , U519748 , http://oro.open.ac.uk/23217/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1795947855?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://oro.open.ac.uk/23217/ , 494618 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spectacular+political+experiments%3A+the+constitution%2C+mediation+and+performance+of+large-scale+public+participation+execises&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mahony%2C+Nick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Theoretical and experimental study on multidimensional critical regulation and control forhigh efficient utilization of water resources in theirrigation and drainage system,"Translation from original language as provided by author China is a large developing agricultural country, and irrigation district plays important roles in ensureing food securit, increasing farmer's income, and maintaining social harmony. But for a long time, due to the lack of scientific management, agricultural water waste and water environment depravation have become increasingly prominent. By comprehensively reviewing the theories of regulating farmland water and nutrients at the condition of control irrigation and drainage, and the theories of water saving irrigation and control drainge , water resources systerm analysis and critical control, based on the local experiment data and simulation , the paper have discussed theories and measures about multidimensional critical regulation and control for high efficient utilization of water resources in the irrigation and drainage system, which is of great importance both in theory and practice on enriching the irrigation and drainage system analysis and constructing water saving and pollute preventing society. The first Chapter is an introduction to the main research areas and technical routes involved in this dissertation. In the second Chapter, by comprehensively reviewing the recent development of the domestic and international research situations on the theories of water saving irrigation and control drainge , water resources systerm analysis and critical control, combine with the characteristic of irrigation and drainage systerm, described the definition and meaning of high efficient utilization of water resources in the irrigation and drainage system, then guided by the theories of critical regulation, the basal theories of multidimensional critical regulation and control for high efficient utilization of water resources in the irrigation and drainage system have been put forward. In Chapter 3, the multidimensional regulation (different water and nitrogen treatments and control of drainge or noncontrol of drainge) experiments of bucket and farmland have been introduced, and the results of nitrogen movement and transformation experiment labelled by have been analysed.The two experiments were carried out in Tuanlin Irrigation Experiment Station in 2002 and 2007. In Chapter 4, By comprehensively reviewing the recent development of crop simulation model, ORYZA2000 was been introduced. On the basis of calibration and validation for ORYZA2000, and by using long term climate data, the effect of different water regimes on yield, water productivity and water balance were simulated and analyzed; and the effect of ground water on lowland rice irrigation was explored. In Chapter 5, firstly, the drainage mode basing on regulation of drainage water quality was been put forward. After reviewing the recent development of hydrology and water quality model on farmland scale, DRAINMOD was been introduced, and the parameters of DRAINMOD model that is used mainly are drafted and examined. The water table, surface runoff and subsurface dra inage of Tuanlin Irrigation Experiment data was been simulated by DRAINMOD. In Chapter 6, Definition and meaning of healthy and efficient field ecosystem have been introduced. And connection between Soil Water Deficit and crop growth have been analysed.Guided by the theories threshold of ecosystem, the meaning and definition about ecological water requirement of irrigation and drainage system have been introduced, and the count measures of each part have been also put forward. Based on theories of system dynamics, the SD model of ecological water requirement threshold have been set up. In Chapter 7, At first,Rice fertilizer-N Critical Regulation Model have been put forward, then the index and condition of critical regulation and control for high efficient utilization of water resources in the irrigation and drainage system have been analysed. Based on these, the multidimensional critical regulation and control model for high efficient utilization of water resources in the irrigation and drainage system have been constructed. At last, by the experiment data of Tuanlin Irrigation Experiment in 2007, the ecological water requirement threshold, field water resources requirement and rice fertilizer-N critical requirement have been caculated. It is significant for enriching and developing the method and theory of the irrigation and drainage regulation , enhancing the utilization of water and fertilizer, preventing and controlling the non-point source pollution of field and surface and subsurface water logging , maintaining the ecological balance of irrigation district ,and promoting agriculture sustainable development. In Chapter 8, Based on the research of theory and experiment, the mode and mechanism for high efficient utilization of water resources in the irrigation and drainage system have been put forward. Take Zhanghe irrigation district in Hubei province for example, lots of countmeasures for enhancing water resources use efficiency have been advised.

However, China is still at an initial stage of green purchase, thus government should constitute the system of government green purchase according to the national economic situation, and improve the awareness of public. Based on the theoretical study of both domestic and international government green purchasing, I will make a further approach to the perfectness of the system of China's government green purchase in this report. The report body consists of six parts. Besides introduction and conclusion, the report is divided into four chapters. The first and second chapters give the readers a overview on the researches related to the government green purchase system. The third and fourth chapters present some indepth analysis base on realistic scenarios and suggestions to improve China's current government green purchase system. Chapter 1 conludes the concept and characteristics of the government green purchase(refers as GGP in later part of this report). It refers to a series of actions that institutional purchasers carried out to reduce the cost and protect the environment. It has two major characteristics. First, it takes the environmental protection as its starting point and ultimate goal. Second, it takes the government purchase system as its guarantee. The GGP system refers to a series of laws and regulations that in line with the specific management of government purchase. Through the research of its development trend in various countries, this report proposes that establishment and perfection of the relevant law system is the optimal way to manage the GGP. Chapter 2 discusses the theoretical element of GGP through economic and administrative view. Green supply chain management theory is the analysis from the purchasing angle, which includes the acquisition of the raw materials, design, development, production, packaging, storage, transportation, usage and recycle. Government green purchase, being a part of green supply chain may reduce consumption behavior damaged to the environment from the consumptive terminal and contain extensive business producers, which is beneficial to China's sustainable development goals. The theory of accountability government is analysed from the governmental perspective. Accountability government is credited with public reliance. GGP is an important way to strengthen the public reliance. It has a positive influence not only on common consumer but also on the suppliers of the products so as to promote the development of green industries and technology, and help domestic enterprises to break green technology barriers on international trading. Chapter 3 presents a general description on current development of the domestic GGP. Through the realistic analysis on the achievements made by the central and local systems of GGP, the imperfection of GGP's legal documentation and low system, we sum up four internal factors that impact China's implementation of the GGP system. The first is the purchasing staffs have limitations to access information. Second, the green products are not dominant in the market. Third, protection of the laws and regulations are insufficient. Last but not least, public awareness of environmental protection need to be strengthened. Chapter 4 is the core of this report. We propose some basic ideas and system design to improve China's GGP. First of all , we give a basic idea from a macro level. The purpose of GGP is to achieve the environmental protection and resources conservation. The basic principles include considering the needs of the purchase, calculating the life cycle of the products and services, investigating the environmental protection work of the corporation, and capturing environmental information. Its main body is defined as the government, institutions and social organizations, and their responsibilities include publicizing and educating, establishing purchase policies and enhancing information exchange. Then, feasible solutions such as listing system, standardized system, preference system, and monitoring system are designed for the existing implementation",1874933054,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Juan JuanZhangJuanJuanZhang, Juan Juan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319217991 , 70608622 , 189128 , 10520301 , 10520301", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874933054?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10520301 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+research+on+the+system+of+government+green+purchase&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Juan+Juan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From the Tito -Stalin split to Yugoslavia's Finnish connection: Neutralism before non -alignment, 1948–1958","After the Second World War the European continent stood divided between two clearly defined and competing systems of government, economic and social progress. Historians have repeatedly analyzed the formation of the Soviet bloc in the east, the subsequent superpower confrontation, and the resulting rise of Euro-Atlantic interconnection in the west. This dissertation provides a new view of how two borderlands steered clear of absorption into the Soviet bloc. It addresses the foreign relations of Yugoslavia and Finland with the Soviet Union and with each other between 1948 and 1958. Narrated here are their separate yet comparable and, to some extent, coordinated contests with the Soviet Union. Ending the presumed partnership with the Soviet Union, the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 launched Yugoslavia on a search for an alternative foreign policy, one that previously began before the split and helped to provoke it. After the split that search turned to avoiding violent conflict with the Soviet Union while creating alternative international partnerships to help the Communist state to survive in difficult postwar conditions. Finnish-Soviet relations between 1944 and 1948 showed the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry that in order to avoid invasion, it would have to demonstrate a commitment to minimizing security risks to the Soviet Union along its European political border and to not interfering in the Soviet domination of domestic politics elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Following Yugoslavia’s expulsion from the Soviet bloc, its party leadership increasingly granted the Foreign Ministry resources needed to establish a wider and more important range of diplomatic relations than those of any East European state. The placement of Tito’s closest associate Kardelj as Foreign Minister from August 1948 to January 1953 carried the process forward. It created a Yugoslav Foreign Ministry that produced political analysis independent from that of Tito’s own committee on foreign relations. By 1953, the ministry regarded the Finnish model of neutralism as a solution to the Yugoslav security dilemma. It came to abandon that in favor of the Non-Aligned Movement only after 1958, when it became clear that relations between Yugoslav and Soviet parties would not be harmonious even after rapprochement.",230764009,,Dissertations & Theses," Kullaa, Rinna ElinaKullaaElinaRinnaKullaa, Rinna Elina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1663078761 , 42228161 , 66569 , 9780549963073 , 3339493 , 3339493", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549963073, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/230764009?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0724 Russian history"," 0335 European history , 0724 Russian history"," 0335 European history , 0724 Russian history",," 0335 European history , 0724 Russian history"," European history , Russian history"," Social sciences , Finland , Soviet Union , Stalin, Joseph , Tito, Josip Broz , Yugoslavia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+the+Tito+-Stalin+split+to+Yugoslavia%27s+Finnish+connection%3A+Neutralism+before+non+-alignment%2C+1948%E2%80%931958&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kullaa%2C+Rinna+Elina&amp;isbn=9780549963073&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Living the second amendment: an ethnography of gun rights activism in the United States,"The United States is often referred to as a ""gun culture"", not least because there are an estimated 250-300 million firearms in civilian possession.  Yet a high level of gun ownership alone does not make the U.S. unique; arguable what does is that millions of Americans believe the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights codifies the individual right to keep and bear arms, and should render federal gun control legislation ""unconstitutional"".  Organisations defending this right and fighting gun control legislation such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) are among the most powerful in the country, with strong ties to the Republican administration in 2006.  Because of this influence, most literature on the gun control debate describes the ""gun lobby"" as a special interest group protecting not merely the gun owners but also the gun industry. Whilst their interests often coincide, this view neglects an organised network of thousands, if not millions, of grassroots gun rights activists in local, regional, national, international and cyber-communities.  Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in seven US states, Washington D.C., and London, England, this thesis explores: who are gun rights activists?  Why do they participate?  What does the right to keep and bear arms mean to them?  What do they hope to achieve in their individual lives, in the US and increasingly, in the world?  Grounded in the words and experiences of the activists themselves, and drawing particularly on the Gun Rights Policy Conference which has received no prior mention in academic literature, this thesis departs from most gun control scholarship. This thesis argues that gun rights activism is better conceptualised as part of an organised right-wing populist social movement with roots in the rise of the US Right in the 1970s.",301716768,,Dissertations & Theses," Allen, C.

I focus on the artistic practices of Yayoi Kusama, Valie Export, and Martha Rosler as three representative case studies that I take to be crucial examples of a larger development within feminist art of that period. Specifically, this development concerns the emergence of an explicitly spatialized form of feminist art production: sculptural, photographic, conceptual and performance practices that pointedly engaged the spatial parameters of the city. In a field of artistic practice that was itself preoccupied with questions of the spatial (from minimalism and installation to earth art and so on) many women artists began to imagine their own feminist responses to space—to imagine the production of new kinds of spaces. These responses would stem from their own positioning as ""different,"" to advocate for a broad embrace of difference as the necessary condition of a working public (or counterpublic) sphere. The work of artists such as Kusama, Export, and Rosier, I argue, insisted upon the importance of difference within an urban setting that in the late 1960s and early 70s was registered as increasingly homogenous, increasingly colonized and saturated by capital—what Guy Debord would call ""the spectacle."" For these artists two concerns seem to emerge simultaneously: on the one hand, the fact that the cities they lived in were under pressure, were becoming increasingly contested spaces; and second, that as women, they might for the first time seize that space as their own, as a site of artistic production. The spatializing impulse in the work of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama is the focus of the first chapter, in which I examine her movement from paintings and sculptural environments to her widely publicized ""naked happenings."" Next I turn to the street actions and ""body configurations"" of Austrian artist Valie Export, in which the stubborn particularities of the body are positioned against the rationalizing logic of the civic architectural system. Finally, I address Martha Rosler's urban-based work of the 1970s, exploring the ways in which her photographic and video practices operate around the terms of visibility and invisibility within the imbricated spheres of private and public life.",304140642,,Dissertations & Theses," Dawsey, Jill ChristinaDawseyChristinaJillDawsey, Jill Christina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1672045751 , 40143261 , 66569 , 9780549986034 , 3343575 , 3343575", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549986034, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304140642?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," Art history , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Art , Austria , Export, Valie , Japan , Kusama, Yayoi , Rosler, Martha , Urban space , Women artists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+uses+of+sidewalks%3A+Women%2C+art%2C+and+urban+space%2C+1966%E2%80%931980&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dawsey%2C+Jill+Christina&amp;isbn=9780549986034&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Nuclear factor (erythroid 2-like) factor 2 (Nrf2) as cellular protector in bile acid and retinoid toxicities,"North America is the world’s largest pulp and paper producing region as well as the largest consuming region. An understanding of market integration is critical for designing relevant policies since it is important to improve national welfare and ensure long-run competitive market equilibrium. In addition, it is crucial for the Canadian industry to maintain the competitiveness for its pulp and paper products in the world market, because any deterioration in the performance of the Canadian pulp and paper industry will have negative social and economic impact on the well-being of Canada and affect Canadian balance of payment. This thesis contains three essays that investigate the market integration of the combined markets of Canada and the US, and the competitive position of Canadian pulp and paper products in the US market. The first essay presents an econometric analysis of spatial integration of the US and Canada newsprint markets as reflected in newsprint prices. It applies the Johansen multivariate cointegration procedure to test the law of one price for five regional markets (British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, US east, US west) of newsprint using monthly data for the 1988 to 2004 period. Preliminary data analysis shows that all price series are non-stationary I(1) processes. The hypothesis that the Law of One Price (LOP) holds for all five regional newsprint markets simultaneously was not supported by the Johansen multivariate test. The LOP was also tested for national markets, and it was found to hold between US west and US east newsprint prices. The results suggest that there is a single newsprint market in the US, whereas there are several distinct newsprint markets in Canada. The second essay examines the degree of market integration among US import markets for three pulp and paper products, and further analyses the dynamic interaction between US domestic and US import markets. Persistence profile results show that long-run equilibrium exists in the US import markets for three pulp and paper products of interest; moreover, given a system-wide shock, a new equilibrium could be reached in a relatively short period. Forecast error variance decomposition suggests that US markets are critical since shocks to domestic US prices for relevant pulp and paper products explain a substantial amount of movements in import prices. The third essay studies substitution between main categories of imported pulp and paper products and between imported and domestic pulp and paper products in the US market. A restricted translog subcost function approach was employed to derive the elasticity of substitution. The results suggest that Canadian pulp and paper products are still competitive and have maintained their competitiveness in the US market. However the consecutive demand decline for pulp and paper in the US has brought hard times to Canada. It seems that if Canadian pulp and paper industry wants to retain a dominant position in the world market place, it will have to create global reach and develop new markets.",304358631,,Dissertations & Theses," Tan, Kah Poh (Hendrick)TanPoh (Hendrick)KahTan, Kah Poh (Hendrick)", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1999454131 , 40256321 , 66569 , 9780494581001 , NR58100 , NR58100", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780494581001, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304358631?accountid=14496," 0383 Toxicology , 0383 Surgery , 0419 Pharmacology"," 0383 Toxicology , 0383 Surgery , 0419 Pharmacology"," 0383 Toxicology , 0383 Surgery , 0419 Pharmacology",," 0383 Toxicology , 0383 Surgery , 0419 Pharmacology"," Toxicology , Surgery , Pharmacology"," Health and environmental sciences , Bile acid , Cellular protector , Oxidative stress , Retinoic acid , Retinoid toxicities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nuclear+factor+%28erythroid+2-like%29+factor+2+%28Nrf2%29+as+cellular+protector+in+bile+acid+and+retinoid+toxicities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tan%2C+Kah+Poh+%28Hendrick%29&amp;isbn=9780494581001&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Understanding Cree religious discourse,"Pentecostalism, a relatively new branch of Christianity focused on acquiring God's spiritual gifts as the early church did, is a major movement in Aboriginal communities across the Canadian north. By conducting some 14 months ethnographic fieldwork in northern Alberta (primarily Trout Lake and Peerless Lake), I have begun to study this religion in its social context. Using ethnographic and historical methods, I trace the development of Cree Pentecostalism from sect to majority status. I also assess the function of the Cree language, and attend to the role of discourse in general, in Cree Pentecostal worship. I examine the relationship between Pentecostal conversion and other trends and movements in Cree society, and document the relationship between Pentecostal practice and that of other religious networks. By conducting most of my fieldwork in Trout Lake, a community where census data indicate that Pentecostals are in the majority, I am able to consider Pentecostals as more than a fringe group, while also querying whether or not Pentecostalism actually is the majority religion in the community. I take a tripartite approach, using the classical cultural-historical approach of Boasian anthropology, combined with the broad scope of relevant data seen in the interpretive turn of Geertz, Turner, and Douglas, as amplified by Hymes, Tedlock and others under the rubric of discourse analysis; thirdly, I open up the intellectual scope of the thesis to emphasize experiences of the spiritual as well as discourses about spiritual ideas—in this way I emphasize the description of cultural and personal transformations, set firmly within the context of holism and interpretive thick description, as the cutting edge of ethnographic practice. Using scholarly literature from global Pentecostalism and North American Christianity, including works by Cox, Meyer, Lawless, Titon, Luhrmann, and Harding, I suggest that Pentecostal practice depends on learning a new linguistic register, and overall is strongly dependant on discourse and genre. This opens the door to assessing how Christian practices interact with or translate local culture and meaning systems. In assessing these questions I assess theoretical perspectives developed by Sahlins, Thompson, Dombrowski, Preston, Laugrand, Robbins, Schieffelin, Goulet, Philips Valentine, and others.",304408355,,Dissertations & Theses," Westman, Clinton NormanWestmanNormanClintonWestman, Clinton Norman", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1678418211 , 42314901 , 66569 , 9780494464526 , NR46452 , NR46452", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780494464526, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304408355?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Alberta , Cree , Pentecostalism , Religious discourse",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+Cree+religious+discourse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westman%2C+Clinton+Norman&amp;isbn=9780494464526&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""“Looking to the government”: Community, politics and the production of memory and silences in twentieth-century Peru, Ayacucho","This dissertation explores from a cultural and linguistic standpoint the political process in the relationship between the state and indigenous communities of Ayacucho, Peru, throughout the twentieth-century.

The first chapter introduces the concept and potential impacts of an economy choosing to focus on one specific industry, either out of desire or necessity, in their quest for development. The two industries considered in this study are the natural resource sector and the external sector, which includes such industries as tourism. Chapter two explores the connection between rent seeking and resource intensity in U.S. states. A theoretical model is developed relating the immobility of a state’s dominant industry to the tax rate imposed on producers in that industry and the level of rent seeking activities within the state. The empirical model shows that resource abundance is significantly related to increases in rent seeking at the state level for the period of 1986 to 2005. Chapter three examines the link between resource intensity and welfare in U.S. states. There is mixed evidence on how the negative growth effect of the resource curse impacts the welfare of a country’s population in international datasets. This chapter extends this literature by analyzing the relationship between natural resource abundance and human welfare in a sample of U.S. states. In addition, the relative importance of each transmission channel on the impact of resource intensity on welfare is examined. The results of this study show that natural resource intensity is associated with a reduction in the welfare of residents in U.S. states and the education and rent seeking transmission channels appear to be responsible for the greatest overall reductions in welfare. Chapter four examines the connection between political dependence and welfare and development of small island economies. Four principal advantages of political dependence cited are the access to foreign aid, foreign capital and external labor markets, and gains in the tourism industry. This study analyzes if political dependence is associated with inflows of foreign aid and foreign capital, the movement of labor and growth in the tourism industry and the relative importance of each of these advantages on the welfare and development in the island.

Hip hop has indeed evolved into a global phenomenon. This dissertation is grounded in Afro-modern, Afrocentric and African-centered theory and utilizes textual and content analysis. This dissertation offers a panoramic view of pre-hip hop era and hip hop era icons, iconology, archetypes and aesthetics and teases out their influence on hip hop aesthetics. I identify specific figures, movements and events within the context of African American and American folk and popular culture traditions and link them to developments within hip hop culture, iconography and aesthetics. Chapter 1 provides an introduction, which includes a definition of terms, statement of the problem and literature review. It also offers a perfunctory discussion of hip hop as culture. Chapter 2 examines pre-hip hop American popular culture in the twentieth century such as America's World's Fairs, superhero mythology, popular culture iconography, etc. and illustrate the ways in which they served as cultural, social and historical precursors to hip hop aesthetics. Lastly, this chapter identifies Afrocentric cross-currents within hip hop culture, which I describe as the post-Afrocentric movement in hip hop culture, and illustrate the ways in which hip hop culture grappled with the efficacy and viability of Afrocentric motifs, theory and aesthetics Chapter 3 offers a comparative analysis of blues and hip hop aesthetics. I explore gender dynamics within the context of inter-genre, call-and-response between male emcees and female neo-soul artists. Chapter 4 traces the development of hip-hop aesthetics and draws on African, American and African-American cultural practices to analyze its development. I focus on early characteristics of hip-hop culture, which are foundational components of hip-hop expression such as the influence of comic book super hero narratives. Hip-hop aesthetics are an amalgamation of post-modern, post-industrial, urban blues sensibilities filtered through African-American musical traditions. I utilize Bakari Kitwana's conceptualization of the hip hop worldview as a basis for highlighting hip hop attitudes, aesthetics, and expectations. Lastly, chapter 4 expands upon previous socio-economic discussions on hip hop culture with a focus on hip hop aesthetics and expression. In chapter 5, I explore hip-hop iconography, iconology and archetypes. I identify specific pre-hip hop icons and explore their influence on hip-hop aesthetics. I examine African American iconology and its relevance to hip-hop aesthetics. I also identify more recent hip hop icons and archetypes (e.g. the hater and gold digger), which operate as signifiers in hip hop narratives and aesthetics. Chapter 6 identifies specific characteristics of hip hop expression. I examine hip-hop aesthetics and archetypal influences, particularly notions of ""bad"" and ""cool"" within hip-hop culture. Perhaps more than any other African-American archetype, the badman/bad nigga archetype has survived within African-American male narratives. I explore the evolution of bad within hip hop aesthetics and offer a cultural analysis of 1984, identifying specific icons (e.g. Run-DMC and Mr. T), attitudes, values and trends that shaped both hip-hop culture and American popular culture. I examine specific cross-currents within 1980s American popular media and explore the ways in which hip hop narratives and aesthetics reappropriate and engage specific popular culture texts. I assert that not only was the framework for hip-hop aesthetics were solidified during 1984. I identify key figures, icons, archetypes, and popular media, circa 1984, and their influence on hip hop aesthetics and discourse.",304481586,,Dissertations & Theses," Boone, William EdwardBooneEdwardWilliamBoone, William Edward", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1652090761 , 39055771 , 66569 , 9780549705963 , 3319997 , 3319997", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549705963, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304481586?accountid=14496," 0325 Black studies , 0413 Music"," 0325 Black studies , 0413 Music"," 0325 Black studies , 0413 Music",," 0325 Black studies , 0413 Music"," Black studies , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Aesthetics , Archetypes , Hip-hop , Icons , Popular culture , Popular culture icons",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+beautiful+struggle%3A+An+analysis+of+hip+hop+icons%2C+archetypes%2C+and+aesthetics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boone%2C+William+Edward&amp;isbn=9780549705963&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The politics of images: Chinese cinema in the context of globalization,"This dissertation explores the interaction between filmmaking and the changing exigencies of leftist political ideologies in China at different stages of modernity: semi-colonial modernity, socialist modernity, and global modernity. Besides a historical examination of the left-wing cinema movement in the 1930s and socialist cinema in the Mao era, it focuses on the so-called ""main melody"" films that are either produced with financial backing by the state or sanctioned by governmental film awards in 1990s China. As products of globalization, Chinese ""main melody"" films are growing in complexity and maturity with the deepening of globalization, especially in competition with Hollywood cinema. Inspired by Louis Althusser, this dissertation attempts to address the lacunae of existing scholarship on Chinese ""main melody"" films by analyzing the role of the film medium as a significant ideological state apparatus (ISA) in serving ideological transitions occurring in 1990s China. Meanwhile, it also examines how the operation of the ideological mechanism in Chinese ""main melody"" films is different from the Althusserian definition. An examination of the polyphonic narration of history shows how the revolutionary history has been retold in ""main melody"" films in different ways to create a rich discursive space in post-socialist China. Special attention has also been paid to the cinematic representation of Chinese nationalism, contending that the instigation of nationalism in non-EuroAmerican societies—despite the fact that nationalism can be easily appropriated by the state as an effective ideological discourse to conceal domestic social conflicts—calls attention to the often ignored historical linkages between colonialism and the expanding global capitalism. In addition, it also examines the role of Chinese intellectuals in the discursive construction of nationalism. An analysis of Chinese masculinity shows that recent changes in gender discourse are closely related to China's socio-economic development in the era of globalization. Based on Stuart Hall's ""encoding/decoding"" model, the last part of this dissertation explores how the Chinese spectator as a subject can negotiate the ideological interpellation by the ""main melody"" film text in his/her own way.",304489739,,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, HongmeiYuHongmeiYu, Hongmei", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594972911 , 41044401 , 66569 , 9780549770244 , 3325692 , 3325692", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549770244, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304489739?accountid=14496, 0900 Film studies, 0900 Film studies, 0900 Film studies,, 0900 Film studies, Film studies," Communication and the arts , Chinese , Chinese cinema , Cinema , Globalization , Ideological criticism , Main Melody Film",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+images%3A+Chinese+cinema+in+the+context+of+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Hongmei&amp;isbn=9780549770244&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Land conflict in subsaharan Africa: Development and evictions along the Morogoro highway, Tanzania","A study of development theories translated into practices and the resulting eviction of people occupying land by the road point out various reasons as to why individuals resist state directives. These include how long people have occupied specific land, whether the land is in a rural or urban setting, whether they have titles to occupy land, and the cultural meanings that people attach to land. This dissertation addresses one of the most contentious developmental and political issues now facing Tanzania and many Southern African countries, the privatization of land as a result of neo-liberal economic reforms and the evictions and conflict generated. There is a gap between laws and policies land, which are designed to protect the customary rights of indigenous African communities and individuals, and the actual policies and practices regarding land on the ground, which typically favor the interests of those pursuing large-scale development projects, including foreign investors and government officials. Despite the recent multi-party democratic reforms, ordinary people have not turned to their elected representative at the local or regional level or to NGOs as allies in the efforts to resist land evictions. To understand development as a concept and its outcome when translated into action, I analyzed development theories including modernization, dependency, world system, and new institutionalism. These four development theories prescribe different solutions to developing countries problems. As a result of the disconnection between the theories and what is happening on the ground, I drew on social movement theories to understand local people reactions toward development programs. The study also explores the relationship among land stakeholders in Tanzania and analyzes how uncoordinated relationships among state officials lead to conflict over land. It also shows gender inequality in land access and ownership and how women used their position as women to frame their resistance to attract the attention of not only the media and the government of Tanzania but also the international community. A central finding is that for land development programs to be of benefit to the targeted population, all involved stakeholders should be involved in the process.",304512567,,Dissertations & Theses," Kilonzo, Rehema GodfreyKilonzoGodfreyRehemaKilonzo, Rehema Godfrey", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1627092931 , 41604771 , 66569 , 9780549718741 , 3321908 , 3321908", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549718741, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304512567?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Sociology , Social structure , Land , Conflict , Highway construction , Evictions , Tanzania"," Social sciences , Development , Evictions , Framing , Land conflict , Morogoro highway , Outcomes , Policy , Resistance , Sub-Saharan Africa , Tanzania",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Land+conflict+in+subsaharan+Africa%3A+Development+and+evictions+along+the+Morogoro+highway%2C+Tanzania&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kilonzo%2C+Rehema+Godfrey&amp;isbn=9780549718741&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Water and myth in early modern Venice,"Studies of urban space in early modern Venice have mainly focused on areas that correspond to pan-European spatial typologies, such as squares, streets, and markets. Although this method has thrown considerable light on the Piazza and Piazzetta San Marco, the campi , and other land-based centers of Venetian civic activity, this dissertation submits that the urban environment of Venice also included the waterways of the city and its lagoon. Through an interdisciplinary analysis supported by independent research conducted on a boat in Venice, it proposes that between 1200 and 1600 the Venetians approached their aqueous geography as a space whose referential, visual, and experiential properties could be conditioned to enhance the myth of their miraculous origin. Chapter One examines the social and symbolic geography of the water as a public space of daily activities as well as a theatrical arena where aquatic ceremonies communicated water-related themes to international audiences. In Chapter Two the Venetians' receptions for incoming foreign dignitaries are interpreted as structured events in which the visual revelation of the city from the water was choreographed through a highly sophisticated practice of aquatic urban scenography. A reading of the travel literature of aquatic spectators in relation to the phenomenology of aquatic perception in Chapter Three suggests that the architects of palace façades on the Grand Canal formulated an aquatic aesthetic that manipulated the aquatic observer's visual attention, hydrokinetic movement, and sense of mass and gravity to heighten the perceived buoyancy of their buildings. The final chapter focuses on an exceptional example of aquatic urban scenography that may open a new window onto the Venetian career of Andrea Palladio as well as the planning, symbolism, and patronage of his churches of San Giorgio Maggiore and Il Redentore. Mathematical and literary evidence suggests that the architect and his patrons may have aligned the churches in the perspectival and cosmographical field of the Bacino (or bay of) San Marco. Ultimately, these practices may form the urbanistic modality of a widespread yet cohesive cultural promotion of Venice as a divine creation, born from the sea.",304536888,,Dissertations & Theses," Savoy, DanielSavoyDanielSavoy, Daniel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1595299841 , 40132741 , 66569 , 9780549794608 , 3327234 , 3327234", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549794608, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304536888?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0377 Art history"," 0366 Geography , 0377 Art history"," 0366 Geography , 0377 Art history",," 0366 Geography , 0377 Art history"," Geography , Art history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Aquatic aesthetic , Italy , Myth , Palladio, Andrea , Venice , Water",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Water+and+myth+in+early+modern+Venice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Savoy%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=9780549794608&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The National Woman's Party's militant campaign for woman suffrage, 1913–1920: Asserting citizenship rights through political mimesis","This project attends to ways in which the National Woman's Party's (NWP) militant woman suffrage campaign empowered U.S. women to assert their political agency and help earn women's fully-enfranchised citizenship rights through rhetorical acts of political mimesis. Specifically, this study examines how the NWP mimicked political rituals and rhetorics to simultaneously earn political legitimacy and expand women's citizenship roles in the nation-state. To this end, this project examines the NWP's suffrage discourse between 1913 and 1920 to demonstrate the ways in which the group's mimetic strategies both reified and challenged progressive and wartime notions of U.S. nationalism promoted by President Woodrow Wilson and members of Congress. These chapters trace the trajectory of the NWP's campaign as it mimicked inaugural parades, third-party strategies, and congressional and presidential politicking to empower NWP members with the political authority that rivaled the nation's political leaders. The NWP's mimetic strategies allowed NWP members to constitute their national citizenship identities as they accessed reserved political spaces, demanded the attention of President Wilson and members of Congress, engaged the U.S. citizenry as political actors, and suffered severe backlash against their militant acts. In so doing, the NWP helped normalize women's presence in the political sphere, nationalize the suffrage movement, attract national media attention, and ultimately, earn widespread recognition and political legitimacy. Finally, this study looks at the empowering and disempowering potential of political mimesis as a strategy for social and political change, particularly as the NWP formed alliances and divisions among women in national and international communities. In the process, the project looks at how the NWP's rhetoric of political mimesis shaped and was shaped by the democratizing exigencies of President Wilson's nationalist vision; in turn, the NWP's militant campaign helped re-envision the gendered nation.",304571249,,Dissertations & Theses," Stillion Southard, Belinda A.Stillion SouthardA.BelindaStillion Southard, Belinda A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1663079461 , 40232191 , 66569 , 9780549962946 , 3339489 , 3339489", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549962946, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304571249?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication"," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication"," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication",," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication"," Womens studies , Communication , Political parties , Womens suffrage , American history , Citizenship"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Citizenship , Mimesis , National Woman's Party , Nationalism , Rhetoric , Woman suffrage",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+National+Woman%27s+Party%27s+militant+campaign+for+woman+suffrage%2C+1913%E2%80%931920%3A+Asserting+citizenship+rights+through+political+mimesis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stillion+Southard%2C+Belinda+A.&amp;isbn=9780549962946&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Translating identity: English language travel discourse on China, 1976–present","This project consists of a comparative study of the English-language travel discourse on China after 1976, when both Western society and Chinese society have undergone major changes. With China opening up to the world in the late 1970s, an increasing number of foreign visitors have visited China. Among them were diplomats, tourists, teachers, students, businessmen, journalists, or filmmakers. It is the purpose of this project to explore how identity, both personal and collective, Western and Chinese, has been translated, interpreted, and transformed in the travel writings and films on China after 1976 and how these translations of identity have served as a yardstick of social changes in both societies. In this project travel is defined in its broadest sense, including the movement from one place to another, both physically and imaginatively. The distinction has been traditionally a thin one. Travel discourse is the recording of these experiences in its all possible forms: words, pictures, and movies. Travel discourse, in recent cultural studies, is treated more as a theoretical site than as a genre. It is a ""contact zone"", ""space of transulturation"" (Pratt), ""a space in-between"" (Bhabha), and a translation term for comparative cultural studies (Clifford). In this project, travel discourse is seen as a site for translating identity. We construct identity by defining ourselves in relation to an array of people and objects not part of ourselves. Travel is a site for encountering difference and travel discourse is critical in developing a sense of identity and representing identities of other cultures. To travel is to encounter difference through familiarity, and experience an inner journey by way of the outer journey. In this sense, travel is an act of translation, a major trope in this study that refers to the traveler's rendering and representation of a cultural and a people other than his/her own. There are four layers of translations taking place simultaneously in cross-cultural travel discourse: translation of foreign landscapes and communities by travelers, translation of travelers' self identities in terms of their interpretations of a foreign culture, translation of travelers' identities by the locals, and translation of self identities by locals themselves. These four translations are always interrelated, interactive, and mutually defining. The first layer of translating is to bridge the different with the familiar, second the inner with the outer, third the global with the local, last contemporary with the traditional or vice versa. Embedded in contemporary sensibilities, translating a culture is not only poetic and aesthetic but also geopolitical and socio-economical. It is in this process that individual and national identities are questioned, negotiated, constructed, and reconstructed in relation to modernity. It is a ""contact zone"" that complicates binary opposites such as self/other, individual/collective, difference/sameness, and time/space.",304575132,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, JianWuJianWu, Jian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1534582951 , 39983401 , 66569 , 9780549621027 , 3312755 , 3312755", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549621027, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304575132?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature",," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature"," American studies , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , China , Identity , Translating , Travel , Travel discourse",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Translating+identity%3A++English+language+travel+discourse+on+China%2C+1976%E2%80%93present&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Jian&amp;isbn=9780549621027&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Writing communities: Aesthetics, politics, and late modernist literary consolidation","This dissertation examines late modernist constitutions of literary community and their relationship to the processes of literary consolidation. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, social and political exigencies such as the Depression, the rise of Fascism in Europe, the Second World War, and the emergence of a new Cold War led writers and the general public alike to attend more closely to issues of community. In chapters treating the genre of modernist memoir, the later writings of William Carlos Williams, New Directions Books, and the Cold War cultural publication Perspectives USA , I argue that, through a variety of discursive and representational practices, writers, publishers, and patrons actively set out to contest and codify the aesthetic and political legacies (both past and contemporaneous) of modernist community. Often treated as contexts for the literary, these sites of communal constitution helped to determine the canons of and narratives about modernism that circulate to this day. Attending to such constitutions reveals how paradigms central to the concept of modernism—including the imbrication of the literary in commodity culture, the relation of the aesthetic to the quotidian, notions of the ""New,"" literary cosmopolitanism, and the political function imagined for literature—underwent significant revision throughout the mid-century. Moreover, these refashionings expose the various tensions inherent in modernism's transition from a self-proclaimed countercultural movement to a mainstream phenomenon. My analysis also importantly recovers and resituates the pivotal role played by poet and publisher James Laughlin in the dissemination and reception of modernist writing. This project recuperates literary community as a category of critical inquiry and, methodologically, calls attention to our own scholarly entanglements in the production, perpetuation, and revision of communal paradigms. Though I focus primarily on American modernisms, the scope of this project is more properly characterized as international. The communal and consolidating negotiations that it examines suggest how modernist communities must be read in relation to the forces of expatriation, cultural exchange, and group affiliations that alternately reify and transcend national boundaries. This dissertation participates in conversations vital to modernist scholarship, American cultural studies, print culture, and the institutional history of literary studies.",304577607,,Dissertations & Theses," Healey, Elspeth EgertonHealeyEgertonElspethHealey, Elspeth Egerton", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1663717661 , 41223401 , 66569 , 9780549984870 , 3343086 , 3343086", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549984870, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304577607?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," Modern literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Aesthetics , Late modernism , Laughlin, James , Literary community , Literary consolidation , Modernism , Politics , Writing communities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Writing+communities%3A+Aesthetics%2C+politics%2C+and+late+modernist+literary+consolidation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Healey%2C+Elspeth+Egerton&amp;isbn=9780549984870&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“The problem of the land is the problem of the woman”: A genealogy of ecofeminism at Grailville,"This dissertation brings current theoretical understandings of the relationship between religion, gender, and ecology to bear upon a socio-historical analysis of the evolution of the U.S. Grail at its main center in southwestern Ohio called Grailville.

Grailville, a partially converted old farm on 300 acres of land, has been the organizational heart of the U.S. Grail since 1944. A genealogy of ecofeminism at Grailville demonstrates that the roots of ecofeminism extend farther back than, and well beyond the bounds of, the radical political movements of the 1970s and 80s with which it is commonly identified. Proceeding in reverse chronological order and drawing on archival and ethnographic sources, the dissertation examines the emergence of ecofeminism at Grailville in the late 1970s through 90s and then the mid-century forms of praxis that facilitated that emergence. At Grailville in the 1940s and 50s, women cobbled together new ideological variants out of the discourses of surrendering womanhood, valiant lay sainthood, and Catholic rural life. Although explicitly opposed to feminism and endorsing an instrumentalist appraisal of nature, the Grail's early ideals of valiant Catholic womanhood and Catholic rural life—when deliberately ""lived"" at Grailville—cultivated modes of subjectivity that emerged later as forms of feminism, environmentalism, and ecofeminism. This study complements work already done on the U.S. Grail and Grailville by focusing on the persistent emphases on women and the land and on the longstanding effort to ""make ideas live."" In doing so, it establishes Grailville as an important site of pre-conciliar Catholic agrarianism as well as later forms of ecofeminism, and it places Grailville along the spectrum of U.S. forms of ""lived religion."" With respect to the interdisciplinary study of religion, gender, and ecology, the dissertation makes several contributions. It deepens and broadens scholarly accounts of ecofeminism; it demonstrates the importance of historical, ethnographic, and case-study approaches; and it highlights the eco-social implications of understanding embodied practice—including ritual practice—as pedagogical and normative.",304602073,,Dissertations & Theses," Page, Tovis ErikaPageErikaTovisPage, Tovis Erika", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1618904971 , 40040601 , 66569 , 9780549885009 , 3334833 , 3334833", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549885009, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304602073?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies",," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies"," Religion , Womens studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Catholic , Catholic rural life , Ecofeminism , Grail , Grailville , Lived religion , Ohio , Religion and ecology , Religion and gender , Rural life , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CThe+problem+of+the+land+is+the+problem+of+the+woman%E2%80%9D%3A+A+genealogy+of+ecofeminism+at+Grailville&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Page%2C+Tovis+Erika&amp;isbn=9780549885009&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Exam time: Educational distress, psychological intervention and the middle classes in post liberalization Delhi","This dissertation investigates why, in a country with an educational system that has historically been reliant on exams, there is such a fevered pitch around exams in India today—and why suicide has become such a prominent response to unexpected or disappointing outcomes in exams. I examined what the discourses and practices around secondary school board [10 th and 12 th grades] exams are saying about the society and culture of urban North India at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This work highlights a relatively un-remarked stage of life and brings the experiences of middle class students to the fore. The experience of educational distress serves as a window through which to understand links between processes within family and school, and public culture, which generates discourses on adolescence and stress and depression. This project offers an opportunity to trace the movement of international mental health imperatives to local settings, and to examine the expression of mental distress in a setting of rapid social and cultural change. This dissertation will study distress around education, and discourses about student suicide from the standpoint of students, families, and mental health practitioners—particularly NGOs concerned with student mental health. The English language press plays a role in the discursive formation of educational distress. The newspapers help set up conditions that make exams important, while at the same time running the risk of amplifying the problem of exam stress and student suicide. Drawing from fieldwork carried in New Delhi, India from September 2001 to August 2002, I argue that discourses and practices around education serve multiply as idioms of distress and as part of middle class cultural practice at a time when a 'politics of visibility' has forced a greater publicity of otherwise unspoken aspects of educational practice. The distress around education communicates ambivalence over societal and cultural changes; it involves a fight over what is included in the ambit of consumption; and serves as a context through which arguments over the values that define one as a modern citizen are taking place—through which families stake their claim to a certain place in society.",304612924,,Dissertations & Theses," Taubenberger, SimoneTaubenbergerSimoneTaubenberger, Simone", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1537005701 , 38618361 , 66569 , 9780549578390 , 3309810 , 3309810", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549578390, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304612924?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0622 Clinical psychology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0622 Clinical psychology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0622 Clinical psychology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0525 Educational psychology , 0622 Clinical psychology"," Cultural anthropology , Educational psychology , Clinical psychology , Middle class"," Social sciences , Education , Psychology , Delhi , Educational distress , India , Intervention , Liberalization , Mental health , Middle class , NGOs , Students",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exam+time%3A+Educational+distress%2C+psychological+intervention+and+the+middle+classes+in+post+liberalization+Delhi&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Taubenberger%2C+Simone&amp;isbn=9780549578390&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From paternalism to Black power: Civil Rights, the Black Panther Party, and the evolution of Black leadership in New Orleans, Louisiana","Black protest leadership in New Orleans germinated from a multitude of sources. Unlike other southern cities which were often claimed as the exclusive domain of one organization or another, New Orleans' protest history would prove to be much more complex. National organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) viewed New Orleans as a southern metropolis from which they could carry out their assault against racial discrimination. They considered New Orleans, with its international notoriety and its bohemian sophistication, as a city dying to be saved from its own regional heritage. Black New Orleanians organized themselves into civic, social, and political clubs aimed at securing a better life for themselves and their children. Black labor leaders and ministers supported students and white liberals who were pushing forward an agenda of change. This work is an analysis of the individuals and organizations which influenced the course of the Black liberation struggle in New Orleans—which is typically overlooked by historians. The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 resulted in increased black political participation. The Black Panther Party's arrival in New Orleans signified a shift in the political orientation of Black residents. This dissertation highlights the individuals and organizations that directed the Civil Rights movement in New Orleans and provided leadership at different intervals. The short history of the Black Panther Party in New Orleans represents a watershed in history of Black leadership in the city. Demonstrated herein is the fact that New Orleans must be reexamined as a location of Civil Rights protest comparable to other southern cities.",304625053,,Dissertations & Theses," Firven, Michael Shane, Jr.FirvenShaneMichaelJr.Firven, Michael Shane, Jr.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1612975701 , 39544351 , 66569 , 9780549868170 , 3330764 , 3330764", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549868170, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304625053?accountid=14496," 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history"," 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history"," 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history",," 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history"," Black studies , Black history"," Social sciences , Black Panther Party , Civil rights , Leadership , Louisiana , New Orleans , Paternalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+paternalism+to+Black+power%3A+Civil+Rights%2C+the+Black+Panther+Party%2C+and+the+evolution+of+Black+leadership+in+New+Orleans%2C+Louisiana&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Firven%2C+Michael+Shane%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9780549868170&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Hope derailed: Import substituting development policies in Latin America 1949–1994,"This study presents an examination of the economic development doctrine of Import Substituting Industrialization (ISI), which for a few decades in the mid-20 th century was the key engine for unprecedented growth in a number of larger economies in Latin America. While accepting the consensus view that Latin America's debt decade of the 1980s caused the early demise of the doctrine, three case studies of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are undertaken to test the veracity of ISI’s short-lived success. These country analyses conclude that the application of the doctrine in the continent eschewed a ""one size fits all"" hypothesis and that each nation's own institutional history provided the important context for enabling the doctrine to influence the level and type of success witnessed by these economies. The study explores the intellectual origin, content, stages and structure of the doctrine in order to determine whether in the present regional circumstances, the doctrine’s promise and effects can be repeated. From its very outset, this seminal theory aimed at achieving the economic independence which the earlier 19 th century political independence failed to consolidate. Presently, Latin America faces a choice of continuing under a market driven neo-liberal regime, whose social effects (in a larger context) have been less than promising, or to craft a more inward focused, state-led alternative for which the populist and protectionist ISI might serve as a model. Today’s controversial ""Bolivarian"" movement aims at being this alternative both economically and politically since it tries to utilize this historic petroleum led resource-rich ""window of opportunity"" to finally carve out a more independent course in an increasingly more interdependent global system. While on the surface it is politics that plays an important role in today's questionable democratic practices, this study argues that these incipient democratic reforms would have been unimaginable without the economic factors that undergirded them. There are, however, understandable reasons stemming from policy missteps leading the newly enfranchised constituencies in these nations to decide to elect these controversial leaders. To add clarity, and remain consistent with the ""economic/political continuum"" adopted as a theoretical framework in this study, the following rationalization can be made. If democratization was an important final stage of the neo-liberal reform of the late 20 th century, then it can be argued that the political reversals witnessed in the recent years may reflect the beginning of the abandonment of the neo-liberal ideology that instigated it in the first place. It then follows logically that the present structural readjustments being made in the economic sphere were to be expected. Just as in the earlier 1980s it was the neo-liberal promise of economic reforms that helped bring about the far-reaching democratic reforms in Latin America, it is hence assumed that shortcomings in this neo-liberal promise is what are causing the reversal to radical civilian populism. Along these lines, and short of a ""crystal ball"" guarantee of what may lie ahead, the study concludes that this modern ISI-led perspective, reminiscent of modern new Bolivarianism may well become the chosen blueprint for constructing a unified and more prosperous and democratic future in Latin America.",304638786,,Dissertations & Theses," Visser, William LewisVisserLewisWilliamVisser, William Lewis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1617912081 , 41442931 , 66569 , 9780549687214 , 3316111 , 3316111", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549687214, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304638786?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0509 Economic history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0509 Economic history"," Latin American history , Economic history"," Social sciences , Economic development , ISI , Import substituting industrialization , Latin America , Populism , Protectionism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hope+derailed%3A+Import+substituting+development+policies+in+Latin+America+1949%E2%80%931994&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Visser%2C+William+Lewis&amp;isbn=9780549687214&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The in -between city: Neoliberal globalization, inequality and middle -class politics in Buenos Aires, Argentina (2000–2007)","Looking at the problematic conditions that emerged in Buenos Aires after the Argentine crisis of 2001, the dissertation discusses the causes, patterns and consequences associated with deepening disparities in the city. Beyond the intrinsic interest of market-centric globalization and urban restructuring, I argue that the polarization, fragmentation and contentiousness of Buenos Aires illustrate the widespread surge in urban inequality in a global context of (i) economic restructuring and increased inter-metropolitan competition, (ii) the neoliberalization of urban governance, and (iii) the unprecedented reach of urbanization to virtually every corner of the planet. I first delineate the socio-spatial inequalities emerging in cities, especially when unbridled free-market globalism comes to dominate urban policy and planning. After tracing the broad contours of the case, my narrative shifts attention to the specific impacts that restructuring has impinged on the urban middle classes of Buenos Aires, who have suffered widespread downward social mobility, employment instability and income poverty, and a stark deterioration in the quality of life of their neighborhoods. In the final section, I highlight the political responses to such conditions. With this analysis of the often neglected political agency of the in-between city, I intend to widen the research agenda on urban restructuring, whose analytical scope is often curtailed by theoretical dualisms and the imposition of Anglo-American categories to the study of urban change worldwide. By focusing on the post-crisis period (2002-2007), my analysis shows that, at least for this case, the embattled urban middle classes still matter and largely mediate outcomes in municipal electoral politics, citizen participation programs and redevelopment schemes: (i) electoral support in middle-class areas was decisive to the reelection of a center-left mayor in 2003; (ii) the specific demands and tactics of middle-class activists had an influence on the legislative process leading to the creation of sub-municipal 'communal' units of government; and (iii) the anti-high-rise movement of middle-class residents in a rapidly redeveloping high-density neighborhood led to a revision of citywide planning guidelines and the politicization of zoning.",304657746,,Dissertations & Theses," Kanai, Juan MiguelKanaiMiguelJuanKanai, Juan Miguel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1582039891 , 40818431 , 66569 , 9780549721987 , 3322065 , 3322065", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549721987, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304657746?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning",," 0366 Geography , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," Geography , Social structure , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Argentina , Buenos Aires , Globalization , Inequality , Latin America , Municipal reforms , Neighborhood politics , Social movements , Urban restructuring",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+in+-between+city%3A+Neoliberal+globalization%2C+inequality+and+middle+-class+politics+in+Buenos+Aires%2C+Argentina+%282000%E2%80%932007%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kanai%2C+Juan+Miguel&amp;isbn=9780549721987&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Between conflict and cooperation: Dilemmas in the relations between non -governmental organizations and the state of Brazil,"This dissertation addresses opportunities and obstacles to the formation of cooperative relations between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the state in Brazil, in the context of economic and political changes during the last three decades. The emergence of these organizations during the final years of the 1964-1985 military dictatorships in Brazil imprinted a strong anti-state character on NGOs' political-institutional identities. After 1985, with the democratization of the country, the NGOs' field of activity underwent a process of profound transformation. First, international funders started a gradual withdrawal of support, causing the organizations to experience financial crises and forcing them to explore alternative resources. Second, newly elected national governments began to form partnerships with NGOs to deliver public services. The combination of changed circumstances caused the NGOs to experience ""identity crises."" They faced a dilemma, since their initial formation rested on opposition to the state. The analysis of the Brazilian NGOs' experience rests on a study of ten affiliates of the Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations, known in Portuguese by the acronym ABONG. ABONG unites the oldest and most prominent NGOs in the country. Data were obtained from participant observation, archival sources, and in-depth interviews. Documents published by NGOs, ABONG, and the government were analyzed, and directors, project coordinators, and technical personnel of the NGOs were interviewed on multiple occasions. The study reveals that the NGOs that have succeeded in establishing relations with the state and at the same time increasing their influence on their respective field of action: (i) historical ties with their target populations and with social movements active in their field of interest; (ii) stability of main sources of resources and; (iii) internal political and organizational coherence. While exploring the relations between NGOs and the state in Brazil both historically and within specific settings, the study also addresses issues that are relevant to recent debates about the relationship between civil society actors and the state in Latin America.",304691906,,Dissertations & Theses," Medeiros, Rogerio De SouzaMedeirosDe SouzaRogerioMedeiros, Rogerio De Souza", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1464132201 , 38860881 , 66569 , 9780549412786 , 3296024 , 3296024", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549412786, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304691906?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure",," 0626 Sociology , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," Sociology , Public policy , Social structure"," Social sciences , Brazil , Civil society , Conflict , Cooperation , Latin America , NGOs , Nongovernmental organizations , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+conflict+and+cooperation%3A+Dilemmas+in+the+relations+between+non+-governmental+organizations+and+the+state+of+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Medeiros%2C+Rogerio+De+Souza&amp;isbn=9780549412786&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Engendering Frenchness: Gender and French identity during the long liberation,"This study examines how various gendered forces—social, cultural, and other—combined to shape a new national identity in France following the Second World War. During the war, the Vichy regime, a quasi-fascist government, was in power. After the war, it was important for French people to act like republican men and women. This benefited the nation on two levels: national and international. Nationally, it created a sense of unity and belonging, as well as the stability necessary for reconstruction through a denial of France's Vichy past. Internationally, it allowed France—under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle—to stake a claim as a member of the Great Powers. However, the meaning of republican citizenship was not immediately evident in the tumultuous postwar context. Instead, sources such as women's magazines, novels, newspapers, memoirs, and others, helped to define what it meant to be a French person after the war and to communicate this idea to the populace. This new, gendered national identity was, however, quite narrow in terms of the limits of acceptable behavior for postwar men and women. The first half of the dissertation focuses on the positive definitions of acceptability, or the blueprint for performing a righteous French identity. Topics of inquiry include the permutations of martyrdom, love, and appearance that all contributed toward a conceptualization of—particularly feminine—French identity. The second half of the dissertation emphasizes what happened to those who did not conform to such definitions, such as female torturers, spies, and the femmes tondues. Their punishments were swift and, more importantly, public, thereby acting to inform the French people about the dangers of straying from the norm. Ultimately, such definitions broke down in the face of overwhelming evidence—such as the crisis in Algeria and the burgeoning women's movement—that they were ideal rather than real. This dissertation thus explores the gendered meanings of citizenship and national belonging through an examination of postwar France.",304693011,,Dissertations & Theses," Colvin, Kelly RicciardiColvinRicciardiKellyColvin, Kelly Ricciardi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1629573151 , 40804351 , 66569 , 9780549896951 , 3335642 , 3335642", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549896951, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304693011?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies"," European history , Gender studies"," Social sciences , France , Gender , Liberation , National identity , Women , World War II",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Engendering+Frenchness%3A+Gender+and+French+identity+during+the+long+liberation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Colvin%2C+Kelly+Ricciardi&amp;isbn=9780549896951&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cybercrimes@gambling_sites.com,"Online gambling sites have proliferated exponentially since the mid-1990s generating billions of dollars in revenue annually. However, this successful global industry is frequently the target or the perpetrator of cybercrime, which pose serious problems for gambling operations and players worldwide. This thesis explores cybercrimes at gambling websites, focusing on the organizational dynamics of crime, criminality, and criminal communication. I draw on theories of criminal organization and cyberspace to develop an integrated theory that accounts for how criminals organize, operate, and network in digital environments around the six dimensions of space, time, movement, scope, structure, and preservation. I employ a document analysis methodology for this thesis, by examining gambling commission reports, journal articles, newspaper and magazine articles, security archives, technical white papers, and ""how-to-do-it"" hacker manuals. Documents published between 1996 and 2008 are collected from the interne, university libraries, and journal databases, and this data is coded around seven intersecting areas: interne gambling and cybercrime; organized crime, cyberextortion, and money laundering; hacking and cracking; cheating and collusion; fraud, non-payment of winnings, and software tampering; underage gambling; social control measures against cybercrime. I find that cybercrimes occurring at gambling sites involve a variety of criminals and an assortment of digitized techniques, both of which range in their organizational sophistication. I argue that while my integrated theoretical framework adequately captures crimes and criminality occurring exclusively in cyberspace, it requires modification along the concepts of space, time, and structure to address the organizational traits of crimes and criminals in 'hybrid' space. I then evaluate my revised integrated theory along the criteria of scope, coherence, causality, and predictive power to demonstrate theoretical growth.

Tracing the life trajectories of the exiled students over two continents before and after Tiananmen, I explore how their political ideals and personal values were shaped by institutionalized education and social movements in China, led to action and punishment, and revived and revised under the challenges of changing conditions in exile. This study utilizes narrative as means of illuminating lives of individuals in contexts related to changes in time and place, and in society and politics. A multiple approach is adopted combining four narrative methods, namely, narrative inquiry, life history, oral history and arts-based inquiry. Narrative accounts ofmy own experience are presented together with the contextualized life history of the three Tiananmen student exiles. Drawing on both Chinese and Western literature, I strive to understand what young people need educationally and politically to become responsible citizens in both local and global contexts. The study finds that the exiled students see themselves as patriots betrayed by the Beijing regime: they did what they had been taught-to sacrifice for the communist cause and for the nation, but ironically they were punished by the system that instilled those values and were abandoned by the land they sacrificed themselves for. It is a betrayal of loyalty. This study also shows that the three participants are torn between conflicted values. For example, they struggled between the longing for ordinary life and the urge to sacrifice for a great cause. I coin the term ""exile syndrome"" to describe these conflicts. Parallel to the experiences of the three student exiles, I found myself confronting similar dilemmas during my study of exile. Although the research is conducted in a democratic environment, I, as a Chinese born researcher, was not free from the influence of the political power in China. Citing different concepts in curriculum studies, I argue this study is not only about the exiles, but also a topic in exile. It is, in many senses, a curriculum in exile.",734770530,,Dissertations & Theses," He, Rowena XiaoqingHeXiaoqingRowenaHe, Rowena Xiaoqing", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2099390371 , 53704091 , 66569 , 9780494637937 , NR63793 , NR63793", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780494637937, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/734770530?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0514 School administration , 0615 Political science"," 0332 History , 0514 School administration , 0615 Political science"," 0332 History , 0514 School administration , 0615 Political science",," 0332 History , 0514 School administration , 0615 Political science"," History , School administration , Political science"," Education , Social sciences , China , Political socialization , Student exiles , Tiananmen",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Curriculum+in+exile%3A+A+life-based+inquiry+into+the+political+socialization+experiences+of+three+Chinese+Tiananmen+student+exiles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=He%2C+Rowena+Xiaoqing&amp;isbn=9780494637937&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The european union and the governance of football: a game of levels and agendas,"The institutions of the European Union (EU) have been involved in football-related matters for more than 30 years without having a direct competence in sport. This apparent paradox is the starting point of this thesis, which investigates the origin, development and consequences of EU policies on football. The EU interventions in football issues are examined through a conceptual framework based on models of agenda-setting and multilevel governance. This thesis draws on qualitative research through primary sources, mainly semi-structured interviews and official documents. The most important policy initiatives and decisions of the EU on football matters can be grouped under three headings: freedom of movement for workers, football broadcasting and football governance. EU institutions did not become involved in football matters by their own volition, but as a result of their responsibilities to adjudicate in legal disputes related to freedom of movement for workers and competition policy. The commercialisation of professional football especially over the last few decades generated internal conflicts in the governance of football that were only resolved with recourse to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The EU has acted as an alternative policy venue for football stakeholders wishing to challenge the decisions of football federations. Thus, the EU and football appear as two systems of multilevel governance that have coexisted in parallel for some time but have since clashed as a result of the instrumentalisation of EU venues by football stakeholders. The policies of the EU on football are a compromise between two different visions of the game. Whereas football was initially introduced onto the EU agenda only in economic terms through the ECJ and the Commission, the EU has subsequently developed a more holistic and nuanced vision of football that takes into account its wider social and cultural values. The intervention of the Member States and the European Parliament, at the request of football governing bodies, facilitated the further evolution of EU policies on football. As a result of all these processes, the authority of federations such as the international football federation (Fédération Internationale de Football Association, FIFA) and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has been diffused in favour of a horizontal network of governance that includes representatives from players, clubs and leagues.",898749245,,Dissertations & Theses," Garcia, BorjaGarciaBorjaGarcia, Borja", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488043411 , 64925621 , 101309 , U505563 , U505563 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/5609", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898749245?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0616 International law, International law," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/5609 , 504066 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+european+union+and+the+governance+of+football%3A+a+game+of+levels+and+agendas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garcia%2C+Borja&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The cruel imagination: visual politics of cruelty in contemporary culture,"This thesis deals with cruelty, its representation and its underlying symbolic and political subtext on a psychic as well as on a social level. The perspective that will be adopted within this research is one with a strong emphasis on French theory, psychoanalysis and continental philosophy. This research provides an interface between philosophy and the visual through the angle of cruelty. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that cruelty is an archaic and transversal phenomenon which, while it finds many local, individual and specific expressions throughout cultures and histories, nevertheless indexes a global resonance of pain, desire, death and obscene enjoyment. Cruelty operates a return to the body, a return to desire, a return to archaic beliefs and representations. Cruelty is also an act of mediation between self and other, a relation where the other is integrated through destruction. This power-relation of cruelty is highly political in the sense that it inevitably begs questions of sovereignty and subjection. This power-relation survives in our imagination, contemporary culture and politics under very specific forms, psychic as well as collective figures, postures, enactments, sensations and movements. The objective of this thesis is thus to analyse the trans-cultural and trans-historical visual politics of cruelty.",898771519,,Dissertations & Theses," Chow, OlivierChowOlivierChow, Olivier", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488250691 , 64961771 , 101309 , U507347 , U507347", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898771519?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," 499991 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+cruel+imagination%3A+visual+politics+of+cruelty+in+contemporary+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chow%2C+Olivier&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Encountering the â��eventâ�� in international politics: Gilles Deleuze, â��9/11â��, and the politics of the virtual","Whilst the concept of the â��eventâ�� occupies a central role and is frequently used in discourse of international politics it remains a largely unchallenged and unexplored concept.Â  In response to this lack of critical engagement with the concept of the â��eventâ��, this thesis develops a way of thinking about the production of â��eventsâ��.Â  Drawing upon the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, the thesis argues that instead of understanding the â��eventâ�� as a static object or a coherent whole that refers to what has happened in a fixed moment in time, the â��eventâ�� has to be understood in terms of an ongoing and continuous process of becoming .Â  According to this beginning , the place and meaning of the â��eventâ�� is never determined as such .Â  Rather, as something that is conditioned by and emerges from an interaction of different kinds of lines, processes and movements, the place and meaning of the â��eventâ�� always remains open to change and transformation.Â  This way of thinking about the â��eventâ�� is further developed through an examination of the production of â��9/11â�� as an â��eventâ��.Â  The thesis shows how â��9/11â�� emerges from and is sustained by a mixture of lines and movements, and thereby also stays open to a process of change and transformation.Â  Finally, the thesis looks at how it is possible to understand the politics as well as ethics of encountering â��eventsâ��, arguing that at the centre of this encounter there are always elements of uncertainty and unpredictability, which together open up to an active process of experimentation .Â  This is a highly political process, which has the potential to inscribe certain ways of speaking and thinking about â��eventsâ��, but also to challenge the dominant forces in the social field.",899786337,,Dissertations & Theses," Lundborg, T.LundborgT.Lundborg, T.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491406941 , 64960221 , 101309 , U518796 , U518796 , http://hdl.handle.net/2160/1768", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899786337?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," http://hdl.handle.net/2160/1768 , (UMI)AAIU518796 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Encountering+the+%C3%A2%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BDevent%C3%A2%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD+in+international+politics%3A+Gilles+Deleuze%2C+%C3%A2%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD9%2F11%C3%A2%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%2C+and+the+politics+of+the+virtual&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lundborg%2C+T.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Refracted subject: sexualness in the realms of law and epidemiology,"There are many ways in which gender diversity and sexualness are experienced, spoken of and transacted in India. Recent activism against marginalisation related to sexual and gender nonconformity has led to transformation of some of these idioms into objects that circulate in particular registers of governmentality. In the process, something quite else is created, and this something else portends to speak the truth of 'sexuality in India'. Based on fieldwork carried out between 2005 and 2007 in cities, towns and villages around India, this thesis tells a story of this emergence of 'sexuality' as an aspect of personhood, a political object, a basis for social mobility, a mode of connectedness between people and as a legitimate cause for a movement. The term 'Queer', used variously in India, is a shorthand in some contexts for people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and with South Asian identities such as Hijra, Kothi and Aravani. In others, it refers to a political project challenging norms of heterosexual monogamy, marking a conscious move away from identity-based politics premised on a bio-medical presumption that desire defines personhood. Evoking both these meanings, I examine queer activism as the negotiation of terms of entry of Queer bodies into epidemiological and juridical registers. In relation to the first, I examine interventions of the transnational HIV/AIDS industry that target 'men who have sex with men' – or 'MSM' – the category through which the industry apprehends sexualness between male subjects. I focus on the political-economic conditions of epidemiological knowledge, and on the transformation of idioms of gender and sexualness that its production draws upon. The industry, I argue, is involved in establishing availability of socio-economically marginalised bodies for intervention and research. These relationships of availability are possible because of their promise of social mobility and respectability for queer folk, hitherto despised in masculinist political economies. This mobility is contingent upon the creation and adoption of epidemiologically overdetermined identities which ironically find political significance in being seen as timeless and 'traditional'. The dichotomous being of the 'MSM' - simultaneously the producer and the object of this epidemiological knowledge, implies that the production of this knowledge is predicated upon the ability of queer folk to perform their place in the 'community'. The relationships in the 'field' are already written into the data, and thus the knowledge. Epidemiological knowledge, and the subjects it speaks of, I thus argue, are best understood as articulations of the conditions of their production. The second theme, of Law and the juridical register, opens with an examination of the tensions involved in the production of 'homophobia' as a political object. The disavowal of erotic dimensions in the naming of experiences as 'homophobic violence' is situated in the context of a popular imagination of a worthy juridical subject, and in broader imaginings of power. I then turn to the conditions under which the law, and in particular, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a Victorian anti-sodomy law under which homosexuality is seen to be criminalised, comes to be central to the Queer movement in India. Activism has given Section 377 a 'social life', an awareness of the law in public spheres, amongst law enforcers and branches of the State. Simultaneously, the Law has been inaugurated as a space for the articulation of more diffuse tensions. It has given a tangibility and intelligibility to experiences of exclusion, marginalisation and violence. I then examine a litigation at the High Court of Delhi challenging this law on grounds that it violates Fundamental Rights, focussing on the constitution of a coherent Queer body, cast simultaneously as enumerable, drawing on epidemiological knowledge; and, as capable of instantiation through individual narratives of violation. This project, where a sexuality is ascribed to the citizen-subject, is then juxtaposed with instances where activists actively strip sexualness off of the Queer body in order to make claims to citizenship. This is a cleavage in the Queer movement, an effect of the diversity of bodies it claims to speak of, as, and for, and the conditions under which these diverse bodies seek articulation. Between these projects lies ambiguity, which, I argue, is a precious resource for Queer folk, and for the movement. I suggest a conceptual shift from 'sexuality', (as personhood), to 'sexualness' (where desire flows through subjects without constituting them), argue that the Subject found in registers of governmentality may best be understood in terms of its political economy and distinct from psychic formations, and finally, offer up thoughts for a politics of ambiguity.",1040637512,,Dissertations & Theses," Khanna, AkshayKhannaAkshayKhanna, Akshay", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2762578171 , 71122472 , 101309 , U572557 , U572557 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/4213", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1040637512?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/4213 , (UMI)AAIU572557 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Refracted+subject%3A+sexualness+in+the+realms+of+law+and+epidemiology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khanna%2C+Akshay&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"City transformation.  An interpretive analysis of change in an historic city centre: the case of Hamadan in Iran,"This study investigates the reciprocity between social forces and spatial transformation in the historic core of a middle-scale city. The method of research is qualitative and the interpretive analysis was made based on the data collected from a wide range of the available literature, travelogues, memoirs and archives to study the former situation of the area, in addition to a reading of the present city through the maps, aerial photographs, statistics, architectural surveys, observations and interviews for tracing the more recent changes.  Accordingly, the thesis explores the shaping factors of the bazaar quarter at the heart of the city centre in Hamadan, west of Iran, as the largest marketplace of the town and its region with a remarkable historical background in international trade.  A morphological analysis is then provided of the far-reaching urban interventions by German engineers in Hamadan during the 1930s which were a part of the national programme of modernisation in Iran at the time.  The last part of analysis is devoted to the bottom-up process of re-integration over a seven decade period arising from the super-imposition of a modernist urban plan upon the fabric of this traditional Iranian bazaar.  The evolution of some recent socio-economic and spatial changes is revealed; particularly the new dynamics between the 1930s interventions and the pre-existing but subsequently modified street network of the bazaar area.  The study concludes that a hybrid dynamic is developing from the interplay of these socio-economic changes (in the movement patterns, land-use and land price) and morphological manifestations.  By exploring the mechanisms of reconciliation between the old and new morphological elements, the study attracts the attention of urban managers and designers to the importance of public space agenda in the process of reintegration.",1314564614,,Dissertations & Theses," Sehizadeh, M.SehizadehM.Sehizadeh, M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907790041 , 64929921 , 101309 , U557355 , U557355", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314564614?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," 525018 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=City+transformation.%C2%A0+An+interpretive+analysis+of+change+in+an+historic+city+centre%3A+the+case+of+Hamadan+in+Iran&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sehizadeh%2C+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The imagined ‘child’ behind children’s rights in lima, peru: a politics of constructed and contested relationships","The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) instituted a ‘child rights’ discourse within bi-lateral, multi-lateral and non-governmental development organizations. Through in-depth field work with a range of Peruvian actors, this thesis examines the practical outcomes of this discourse for poor children, and asks what the dynamics of the adoption and implementation of a child rights agenda in Peru reveal about policy-making processes. The status of children in Peru is more visible as a result of the emergence of a robust children’s rights discourse. Yet what does imagining children as rights-bearing subjects mean for the transformation of child well-being through public policy? My broad engagement with a range of perspectives in Lima, Peru with representatives from national ministries, NGO directors, policy administrators, international organization representatives, social movement groups in civil society, academics, field workers, and a group of children in a marginalized neighbourhood -- revealed a host of contesting narratives about children and their rights. This contestation of narratives and perspectives is often described in terms of contradiction or even a ‘gap’ between concepts and practices. By contrast, this project uses the variety of ways in which subjects imagine rights as an intellectual resource for investigating the power that policy frameworks have to obscure or promote certain kinds of political demands. This dissertation argues that greater attention is needed towards the imagined ‘subjects’ present in the policy-making process, along with matched attention towards the framing, policies and material outcomes that emerge from those imaginings. Ultimately, it suggests that contestation and pluralism provide traction for the making of better policy. This thesis emphasizes the interpretation of rights, how children are imagined in policy, and the ways those ideas are implemented into practice, which becomes important in terms of material differences in children’s lives.",1314573404,,Dissertations & Theses," Luttrell-Rowland, MikaelaLuttrell-RowlandMikaelaLuttrell-Rowland, Mikaela", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907875731 , 64938101 , 101309 , U557640 , U557640 , http://opus.bath.ac.uk/20809/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314573404?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0630 Public policy, Public policy," http://opus.bath.ac.uk/20809/ , 519922 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+imagined+%E2%80%98child%E2%80%99+behind+children%E2%80%99s+rights+in+lima%2C+peru%3A+a+politics+of+constructed+and+contested+relationships&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Luttrell-Rowland%2C+Mikaela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Child Health in an Era of Globalization: A Case Study of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan","Research Objectives: Globalization is increasingly considered an important influence on the determinants of health. Globalization, for the purposes of this study, was defined as “a process of greater integration within the world economy through movements of goods and services, capital, technology and (to a lesser extent) labour, which lead increasingly to economic decisions being influenced by global conditions.”(1) Although there have been many conceptual and theoretical explorations of the globalization and health relationship, only a limited number of empirical studies have sought to link the processes of globalization to health effects in a specific context and/or for a particular population such as children. The objectives of this thesis were two-fold: to investigate primarily the economic pathways and related political pathways by which globalization influences the determinants of health and health outcomes in low-income children ages zero to five in a mid-sized Canadian city (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan); to identify and analyze the policy responses at various levels (national, provincial, and municipal) that address the effects of globalization on determinants of health such as household income and distribution, employment and education for parents, housing, and social programs. Study Design and Methodology: This study was a case study that used mixed methods. The case in this research was Saskatoon, a mid-size city located in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The analytical framework used to guide this study was developed by Labonte and Torgerson.(2) Methods included: a demographic profile for the City of Saskatoon; an environmental scan of federal, provincial, and municipal policy that has direct relevance for child health; process tracing; semi-structured interviews with low-income parents of young children (n=26); and trend analysis of child health outcomes among children ages zero to five. Findings: The current phase of globalization in Canada and Saskatchewan is inextricably linked with the implementation of neoliberal policies such as tax restructuring, trade liberalization, privatization, deregulation, and greater integration in the global economy. This phase of globalization contributed to changes in the determinants of health that affect children and their families in Saskatoon. For instance, globalization has involved retrenchment of the welfare state in Canada and Saskatchewan. As the welfare state diminished in size and responsibility, poverty tended to deepen among those that were already poor. The retrenchment of the welfare state also led to diminished program access. In addition, globalization has emphasized the restructuring of the labour market to be more competitive and flexible. A restructured labour market and reduced access to services and programs contributed to greater inequalities in income in Canada, Saskatchewan, and Saskatoon. Finally, globalization contributed to declining housing affordability in Canada’s cities such as Saskatoon. Trend analysis at the neighbourhood-level to determine the linkages between changes in the determinants of child health and changes in child health outcomes was inconclusive. Further research is required to determine if the disparities in the determinants of child health that have been exacerbated by the economic and political processes of globalization have contributed to increasing disparities in child health outcomes. Conclusion: This study indicated that the economic and political processes of globalization influenced the determinants of health among young low-income children and their families in Saskatoon through a number of pathways, but this is not to suggest that globalization was the only phenomenon at work. Although it was very difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the globalization and health relationship with certainty, this study offered a logical and a multi-prong approach to examining the effects of globalization on children’s health and health determining conditions. Studies of this nature are important for contributing to our understanding of the complex structures that influence health and for building up the linkages between globalization and health on a case-by-case basis.",1315959180,,Dissertations & Theses," Cushon, Jennifer A.CushonA.JenniferCushon, Jennifer A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2914016961 , 76211002 , 66569 , 9780494921418 , NR92141 , NR92141", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494921418, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1315959180?accountid=14496," 0385 Canadian studies , 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," 0385 Canadian studies , 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," 0385 Canadian studies , 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science",," 0385 Canadian studies , 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," Canadian studies , Public health , Political science"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Child health , Globalization , Helath outcomes , Low-income families , Saskatchewan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Child+Health+in+an+Era+of+Globalization%3A+A+Case+Study+of+Saskatoon%2C+Saskatchewan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cushon%2C+Jennifer+A.&amp;isbn=9780494921418&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Czech piano music from Smetana to Janácek : style, development, significance","This dissertation will examine the development of Czech piano music through the key figures of Smetana, Dvorak, Foerster, Fibich, Novak, Suk, and Janácek between 1840 and 1912. This period begins with the early piano polkas of Smetana and ends with the last major solo piano work of Janácek in 1912. The chronological framework of the dissertation is important in defining its purpose: the early nineteenth century was a key period in Czech society, and one characterised by aesthetic debates Central to this was the Národní Obrození (National Revival), and the social and cultural framework is essential for a full understanding of the output of the composers in question. At the start of the National Revival, music became invested with an ideological burden which meant that composers were responsible for creating a specifically Czech form of expression. One of the key dualities explored within this dissertation is that of European influence vs the absorption of Czech and Slavonic folk music in the musical languages of the individual composers, so the issue of national vs international is of primary importance here. The ideological backgound of the National Revival meant that opera was afforded more attention, and other genres were marginalised as a result of this focus. This introduces a second duality, namely that of piano music vs opera Previous literature examining, this period of Czech music has focused upon opera and neglected piano music. That which does exist is in Czech, and these writers have concentrated upon detailed analyses of individual works, meaning that a more macroscopic approach linking and connecting the key Czech composers of the period has not existed. This dissertation aims to combine this Czech literature with modern scholarship on surrounding, figures and musical movements in order to give a fuller and more multifaceted account of the period in question, and the role of the piano within it.",1369614202,,Dissertations & Theses," Murphy, SarahMurphySarahMurphy, Sarah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2999985231 , 79996742 , 189128 , 9781303191411 , U584438 , U584438", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781303191411, English, English,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1369614202?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music,, 0413 Music, Music," (UMI)AAIU584438 , Communication and the arts , Czech piano music , National Revival",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Czech+piano+music+from+Smetana+to+Jan%C3%A1cek+%3A+style%2C+development%2C%0Asignificance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Sarah&amp;isbn=9781303191411&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Regulated labour, unruly workers: the making of industrial relations in late nineteenth-century bombay","This dissertation explores the making of industrial relations in colonial Bombay, India's largest manufacturing centre, between the 1870s and the end of the 1890s. The accent is on the cotton textile industry which sprang up in the second half of the nineteenth century, and came to dominate the city. The thesis is divided into three large sections. First, it considers the ideological, commercial, and political contexts of protective factory legislation for India, which was fashioned into a Factory Act in 1881, and revised in 1891. It examines the relationships of factory law in India with precedents in Britain; with the work of campaigners for social reform and 'improvement' in both metropole and colony; and with the commercial antagonism that emerged in the mid- 1870s between the cotton textile industry of Bombay and of Lancashire, its principal competitor. The second section considers the implications of a regime of protective factory regulation for labour relations in Bombay. It examines in particular the dynamics of factory inspection, which both revealed and released significant tensions within the structure of relations between state, capital and labour. It also explores the debates and controversies around the employment of children in mills, and the ambiguities of their nomination as vulnerable subjects of factory law. The final section of the dissertation expands the question of industrial relations beyond the work of law, and describes the transition towards a more combative, fractious set of relations between employers, state and labourers in the 1890s, indexed by the growing frequency of strikes. This culminates in a detailed exploration of the temporary but significant transformation of industrial relations at the end of the century, when Bombay was struck by the global bubonic plague pandemic. The dissertation thus traces a movement from relations encased by the administration of law to relations marked by confrontational industrial politics.",1415221093,,Dissertations & Theses," Sarkar, AdityaSarkarAdityaSarkar, Aditya", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031692011 , 80739612 , 101309 , U581679 , U581679", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415221093?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIU581679 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Regulated+labour%2C+unruly+workers%3A+the+making+of+industrial+relations+in+late+nineteenth-century+bombay&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sarkar%2C+Aditya&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A stranger in the home: immigration to the UK through marriage from 1962.,"This thesis is concerned with the British state’s response to marriage immigration after 1962. Admission of foreign spouses places strangers at the symbolic heart of national life and their claims have often been denied.  Meanwhile, British residents who enable such claims may be regarded as having thereby partially excluded themselves from national life.  This has been particularly so for women for whom marriage is often considered a statement of public allegiance as well as a private act. The thesis establishes this argument through analysis of decision-making by the legislature, the judiciary and the entry clearance service.  It argues that all decision-makers exercise discretionary powers and will usually do so in accordance with their sense of their institutional function informed by their understanding of the nature of the world.  Where this understanding is shared across institutions, congruity in patterns of decision-making may emerge.  This is argued to be largely the case for the period from 1962 to 1997. The thesis argues that, since 1997, perceptions of the threat posed by marriage immigration have become more complex and less uniform.  Skin colour, gender and formal married status have become less significant.  Obedience to state-erected hurdles, cultural conformity and social class have become more prominent although tempered by other competing priorities, particularly human rights values which the courts have recently begun to assert more vigorously. The conclusion places these arguments within the context of the continued desire of nation states to prevent unwanted immigration despite global movement and porous borders.  Many British residents are now part of international diasporas or are themselves recent immigrants.  It is even more difficult to use immigration control to reinforce the role of marriage and family in maintaining an idealised conception of national life even if recent indications are that efforts to do so will continue.",1415248823,,Dissertations & Theses," Wray, H.WrayH.Wray, H.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031692231 , 80739702 , 101309 , U587348 , U587348", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415248823?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIU587348 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+stranger+in+the+home%3A+immigration+to+the+UK+through+marriage+from+1962.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wray%2C+H.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Writing in war, writing on war: the dissolution of yugoslavia in literary discourse","This study examines the literary production of five writers from the former Yugoslavia during the civil war of the 1990s. These writers include Semezdin Mehmedinović, Slobodan Selenić, Vladimir Arsenijević, Dubravka Ugrešić and David Albahari. The central concern of this thesis is to analyse the engagement of their literary narratives in relation to the actual and symbolic waging of war as these works respond, in equal measure, to destruction of homes (homeland) and populations as well as the discursive dissemination of national import. This thesis brings these writers together under the categories of war front, home front, and exile (or migratory movements) which provide a comparative bridge not predicated on the national dimension of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The first chapter considers Mehmedinović’s Sarajevo blues which attests to life under siege and under direct authority of warfare, military logic and the international media organ. The second chapter on Selenić and Arsenijević is schematized through the home front: the territory from which war is displaced (as a material force) but that still registers a change in socio-economic living conditions as a result of severe sanctioning throughout the 1990s. Chapters three and four are focused on the exilic and migratory movements of Ugrešić and Albahari respectively: the critical dimension of their narratives demonstrates the doubled perspective of being elsewhere and not at home, analysing and writing on the war with a clarity and distance which establishes the grounds for judgment. This thesis contributes to the academic knowledge on the subject of Yugoslavia’s break-up by redressing a discursive imbalance that was weighed in favour of social sciences and history. Discussing literary discourse in the context of war explicitly demands that literature be understood as socially relevant. This thesis corrects the paucity of material that has been devoted to examining the contribution of these writers while simultaneously demonstrating how literature can carve out a role of critique, autonomous from homogenizing discourses of the period.",1419804844,,Dissertations & Theses," Obradović, DraganaObradovićDraganaObradović, Dragana", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3042773491 , 81002552 , 101309 , U525550 , U525550 , http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/17262/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1419804844?accountid=14496, 0314 Slavic literature, 0314 Slavic literature, 0314 Slavic literature, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0314 Slavic literature, Slavic literature," http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/17262/ , 505192 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Writing+in+war%2C+writing+on+war%3A+the+dissolution+of+yugoslavia+in+literary+discourse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Obradovi%C4%87%2C+Dragana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The construction of national identity in the historiography of czech art,"National identity can be expressed in many ways by individuals, groups and states. Since the nineteenth century, Central Europe has been undergoing rapid changes in the political, social and cultural spheres, which was reflected in the self-definition of the nations living in this region, and in their definition by others. The Czech people, who until 1918 were a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, gave birth to a national revival movement in the nineteenth century and eventually emancipated themselves to create an independent Czechoslovakia. The idea of „national identity“ was, therefore, crucial and this was enhanced in many areas of human activity, including the construction of a historical legitimacy for the nation. The struggle for recognition of the historical existence of the Czech nation was also projected into the discourse adopted for historical and contemporary art writing and exhibition practice. In this thesis, I focus on the ways in which Czech national identity was constructed in the historiography of art. I shall argue that the various ideologies which influenced the writers led to an understanding of Czech art as epitomising certain qualities of the Czech nation. At the same time, the Czech nation was presented as highly advanced because of its artistic achievements. I shall explore how art historians, historians, artists, archaeologists and philosophers created their notion of a Czech national art on the basis of either negotiating a compromise with the various ethnic groups, methodologies and political affiliations, or by emphasising their opposition to the same. Another contested area was the concept and political uses of artistic quality. It will be my aim to examine broader circumstances of these contestations in the Introduction and more specific ideological motivations behind Czech art history in the subsequent chapters. In Chapter One, I shall outline the main places where art history was practiced in Bohemia and Moravia which were crucial for constructing the discourse on national art. Chapter Two examines the texts of the first Czech art historians in the second half of the nineteenth century who became interested in the national aspects of Czech art because of the political and cultural climate. In Chapter Three, I shall examine the nineteenth century debates between Czech and German authors on the origins of mediaeval art, confirming Czech or German national identity 3 respectively. Chapter Four studies the rise of Czech art history as a “scientific” discipline in Prague and the attempts of Czech art historians at its professionalisation, which – nevertheless – did not abandon a nationalistic discourse. The main focus of Chapter Five is the co-existence of nationalistic views of Czech art with the attempts of artists and art critics to bring Czech art into a dialogue with Western art. In the following chapter, Chapter Six, this practice is explored in the context of the Viennese university and the so-called Vienna School of art history, particularly the work and legacy of Max Dvořák. The influence of the School on Czech art history is the topic of Chapter Seven, which again brings up the question of the divide between international and national perspectives of Czech art. Criticism of the Czech Vienna School followers from various groups of art historians is examined in Chapter Eight. Finally, in Chapter Nine, I conclude with the exploration of the rise of a new concept of art historical identity, the concept of Czechoslovak identity.",1442496732,,Dissertations & Theses," Filipova, MartaFilipovaMartaFilipova, Marta", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101223491 , 80740352 , 101309 , U597867 , U597867 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/791/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442496732?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/791/ , (UMI)AAIU597867 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+construction+of+national+identity+in+the+historiography+of+czech+art&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Filipova%2C+Marta&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"'i predict a riot': mediation and political contention: dissent!'s media practices at the 2005 gleneagles g8 summit,"International meetings such as the G8 Summit have evolved from the sequestered gatherings of the economic elite to full-scale political media events. Using the 2005 Gleneagles G8 Summit as a case study, and focusing on one specific ‘autonomous’ activist network – Dissent! – this thesis investigates how the process of mediation is articulated in activists’ practices in preparing and enacting acts of contention. Dominant approaches to such events in the field of media and communications are often text-centred, focussing on the media’s framing of protest, overlooking the actions against and interactions with the media at such sites. This oversight is significant given that contemporary political struggle occurs on the ground, as well as with and through the media. The theoretical framework applies past media/movement scholarship to emerging discourses on mediation which view media – its content, producers, users, technologies, culture and rituals – as an ongoing and reflexive process, actualised through analysing activists’ media-oriented practices (Couldry, 2004, Silverstone, 2005). The methodological approach follows Burawoy’s (1998) “extended method” drawing on a year of participant observation and 32 in-depth interviews. Analysis is undertaken on an activist, group and network level; before and at the Summit. The findings show that activists demonstrate a reflexive awareness of media, including lay theories of media which inform their actions. On a networklevel, Dissent! established a policy abstaining from media interaction. Yet, despite this, on a group-level, the CounterSpin Collective formed within Dissent! to manage media interest. The Collective’s media practices are shown to be characterised by a strategy of dual adaptation; adapting to both Dissent!’s political limitations and the media’s demands. The analysis of the site of protest in Scotland – Hori-Zone eco-village – and the protest actions undertaken from it, further demonstrates the way in which media orients and permeates activists practices. The concept of spectacular action is developed to analyse a shift in the type of protest activities conducted at a media event from direct action to the simulation of direct action, valuing symbolic over physical disruption. This thesis contributes to a growing interest in the concept of mediation through the emerging field of media practice, offering both empirical evidence and revised theory. Moreover it addresses the largely neglected role of the media in social movement literature. Research undertaken also demonstrates how the logic of media now permeates the practice of activism, marking the rise of spectacular action as a cause for concern for both activists and academics.",1774181913,,Dissertations & Theses," McCurdy, PatrickMcCurdyPatrickMcCurdy, Patrick", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989158011 , 103019142 , 101309 , 10022491 , 10022491 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/5/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774181913?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/5/ , (UMI)AAI10022491 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27i+predict+a+riot%27%3A+mediation+and+political+contention%3A+dissent%21%27s+media+practices+at+the+2005+gleneagles+g8+summit&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCurdy%2C+Patrick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Artistic communication: an analysis of operatic rehearsal processes,"This study focuses on artistic collaboration and the processes that, during an operatic rehearsal period and performance (or potentially any theatrical rehearsal and performance), make incarnate a director's personal or shared vision. The underlying requirement to unite various people within a creative setting, in order to produce an event whose success is determined by those individuals' parts in the making of that event, is a complex one. For the director, eliciting powerful performances is integral to their own professional success in the sense that, as they work through a period of rehearsals, the quality of acting and emotive characterisation will determine, to a large extent, the quality of the production. Many directors have signature styles of directing (see Chapter 2.2.11), developed via their subjective knowledge and the influences they have been exposed to, be they historical periods, psychological qualities, fashionable artistic genres, inter-personal influences, and so on. The language chosen during a rehearsal period (whether that be musical, linguistic, or bodily, via gesture and movement) would seem to be fundamental to the interaction within a group of professional performers and production personnel in which there are different roles, status and foci. For directors, then, intersubjectivity (Trevarthen, 2002) needs to be highly developed, attuning to their performers' understanding, feelings, fears, and emotional robustness, in order to maximise communicative efficacy, especially when one considers that opera singers operate within a global community where castings, often determined simply by vocal quality, can be multinational. The rehearsal period, therefore, is reliant on mutually clear forms of shared attention within a social environment that requires an uninterrupted flow of, often complex, communication.",1774213541,,Dissertations & Theses," Lanipekun, JenniferLanipekunJenniferLanipekun, Jennifer", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989193711 , 102696032 , 101309 , 10023238 , 10023238", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774213541?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10023238 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Artistic+communication%3A+an+analysis+of+operatic+rehearsal+processes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lanipekun%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The reconfiguration of the state in an era of neoliberal globalism: state violence and indigenous responses in the costa chica-montaña of guerrero, mexico","The adoption of the neo-liberal model in the mid-1980s has forced the governing elites to reconfigure the Mexican State. However, the consolidation of a neoliberal State continues to be incomplete and it has been problematic to fully integrated the Mexican economy in the global market due to the increasing organized crime, the dismantling of previous post-revolutionary control mechanisms, and the growing mobilisation of organised indigenous opposition ranging from the peaceful obstruction of hydroelectric mega-projects in their territories to armed struggle. In view of the State crisis, this thesis argues that there has been a shift in the system of control mechanisms of the State that is leaning towards a more recurrent use of open violence to implement its neo-liberal State project. From a theoretical perspective, the research proposes an innovative approach to understanding the formation of the post-revolutionary State, which transcends the State violence dichotomy established between the ´corporatist´ and the ´critical´ approaches in the contemporary literature. The research highlights the wide spectrum of control mechanisms from hegemonic domination to violence used by the governing elites to compensate the unfinished State formation process in order to maintain socio-political stability without profound structural changes. It explores the enhanced tendency of State violence to replace incorporation in Statesociety relations since the efforts to restructure the economy from the 1980s onwards. The thesis analyses how this tendency has grown particularly in response to indigenous movements in the South of Mexico. The argument is substantiated empirically with two case studies undertaken in the sub-region of Costa Chica-Montaña of Guerrero with data from 79 semi-structured interviews with a wide range of social and political actors, and participant observation in ten indigenous communities. The case studies explore the different State control mechanisms used to advance the State formation model in the post revolutionary period; the impact of the crisis of those mechanisms in the sub-region; the violent resistance of local bosses to the loss of power, and the multiples indigenous responses to the implementation of neoliberal policies in their territories. This research also includes a comparative study to explain some factors that strengthen indigenous articulations, as well as their limits in an era of neoliberal globalisation. One of the most important research findings is that neoliberalism has further weakened the 'civilianisation' power of the State to deal peacefully with civil society sectors, particularly with indigenous peoples, while it has strengthened its 'centralised-coercive' power to carry out the imposed State model.

The central problem addressed in this thesis is the way economic globalization (neoliberal ideology) has dominated the thinking of Jordanian policy makers under the claim to recover from market failure and to achieve socio-economic development. Subsequent to this, another deterrent emerges. During preparation, formulation, and implementation of Jordanian policies in the said areas only the authority voice is heard, a situation justified by rationality and the national interest. In relation to this practice, we explored and investigated who were included and who were excluded, as well as, who were the winners and losers in the policy making process at all levels from macro (global) to intermediate (state) to micro (local institutions). This initially became apparent through the reorientation of Jordanian policy towards a free market ideology, then through the strategies of Structural Adjustments Programs (SAPs), Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), deregulations and the cut-down of social programs. The discourses surrounding the national policy have increased in complexity from one orientation towards the privatization of public enterprises, to another in the hope to build a strong economy. This has led to change the structure of power between different classes and has led to new social configurations. In turn we investigated and assessed the process of policy in terms of what, who, why and how? A Post-modern perspective which forms the methodological basis for this thesis is used to capture the complex relation between local and global. The traditional universality linear theories no longer give sufficient understanding of the complexity of policy analysis in an uncertain and dynamic disequilibrium world. The theoretical framework for our analytical critical theory synthesizes the modernism and postmodernism theories. Drawing from this premise, ""critical postmodern policy analysis"" has been introduced as the core element of this analysis. This study is concerned with the transformation of policy and how this transformation is guided by a discourse, consisting of arguments put forward by economists, policy makers, politicians and other experts. This is consistent with a Foucauldian framework. The thesis argues that each policy stage is varied in terms of its contexts, styles, participants and dispositions, and that each stage has unique cultural configurations. Therefore, three critical postmodern approaches were utilized namely: historiography, archaeology and governmentality to examine each policy context at all levels, over the policy trajectory from global to local. Policy historiography was coupled with the early stage of the influence of globalization; policy archaeology with the formation stage of policy development; and policy governmentality with the implementation stage to explore policy in practice. Various documents, in-depth interviews, unpublished files and researcher observation were utilized in order to assess the impact of economic globalization on the three investigated national policies guided by the three critical postmodern approaches: historiography, archaeology and governmentality. As revealed by historiography the neoliberal economic model makes Jordan's government unresponsive to its citizens. It is like hegemonic structure which constantly provides mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. As demonstrated by thesis, the market is far from being fair, and creating new social configurations over the times. The thesis revealed through archaeology that Jordanian bureaucrats, policy experts and public officials have dominated the context of policy text production by using some strategies such as dislocation, legislation, replacement and the leaking of rumors. On the other side the thesis pointed out through governmentality that policies contradict each other, because of different mentalities and different value systems. As revealed by the thesis the three ministries have been based on ad hoc practices rather than on planned strategic decisions. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture has gradually adopted neoliberal policy while the Ministries of Trade and Information Technology were more radical in this process. Governmentality is also revealed that domination, or what is called control at a distance by which policies are centralized in goals and decentralized in means prevailed in the three ministries. This thesis has the shed light on the Islamic discourses. This is an attempt to show how the Islamic movement, from a post modern perspective approach, influenced the collective social imagination of Jordanian people during the nineties of the past century and afterwards. The Islamic movement emerged as an end result support for needy people having been deserted and the adoption of neo-liberal policies by the Jordanian government. As a rule of thumb, postmodernism obviously emphasizes the role of ideology in shaping the configurations of people's thinking, perception and acts.",1795018517,,Dissertations & Theses," Al-Zoubi, Mohammad Orsan MuhseinAl-ZoubiOrsan MuhseinMohammadAl-Zoubi, Mohammad Orsan Muhsein", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4082672081 , 105323232 , 101309 , U511001 , U511001", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1795018517?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," 515496 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+economic+globalization+on+the+national+policies+of+developing+countries%3A+the+case+of+the+jordan%27s+agricultural%2C+information+and+communication+technology+and+trade+and+investment+policies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al-Zoubi%2C+Mohammad+Orsan+Muhsein&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Opposing the 'system': ideology and action in the italian football terraces,"Over the past two decades, the relationship between political extremism and football fans has been the subject of academic, political and policing debates throughout Europe. At football stadiums, in Italy in particular, it is common to witness manifestations of racist intolerance and ideological statements referring to regional, national and international issues. Concurrently, there has been a rise in conflict between Italian police forces and hardcore football fans. The fan-protagonists of such episodes are often groups known as the UltraS; the capital S is a neologism of this study to define neo-fascist oriented supporters. The nomenclature differentiates them from the wider hardcore football supporters who are instead referred in this research as ultrá. Despite their presence among the Italian curve (football terraces), the UltraS have been the subject of very limited methodical ethnographic study. The present study seeks to correct this lacuna and is the result of ethnographic research conducted from 2003 to 2006 and updated from 2007 to 2009. This thesis seeks to evaluate the UltraS phenomenon via an examination of two nationally renowned groups located in the Italian capital of Rome. The groups, the Boys of AS Roma and the Irriducibili of SS Lazio, enact their performances on the respective curve of the city’s Olympic Stadium. This research considers the UltraS gatherings as a form of ‘ideological communitas’. In doing so, analysis introduces and explains the four essential elements of the UltraS logic: the principle of non omologazione (non-conformism), the concept of the ‘true’ UltraS; the opposition of Tradition versus Modernity in the UltraS condition, and finally the attempt by them to live up to the ‘Warrior Spirit’. Analysis further identifies the ideological and anti-system based alliance between the UltraS of Lazio and Roma and other similar gatherings throughout Italy. This phenomenon, together with an increase ideologisation of the Italian curve, incidents such as the death at the hands of the police gun of the SS Lazio fan Gabriele Sandri in 2007 (and the concomitant violent UltraS reactions against a variety of institutions) and the appearance in 2008 of the UltraS Italia, may signify the beginning of an UltraS collective identity, and a concomitant emergent status of the UltraS as a social movement, which stands in opposition to the perceived repressive Italian State and its media allies.",1864759190,,Dissertations & Theses," Testa, AlbertoTestaAlbertoTesta, Alberto", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4311984801 , 102695892 , 101309 , 10303118 , 10303118 , http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/13099", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1864759190?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/13099 , (UMI)AAI10303118 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Opposing+the+%27system%27%3A+ideology+and+action+in+the+italian+football+terraces&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Testa%2C+Alberto&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on the thought of the total denial of capitalism in mao zedong`s later years,"Translation from original language as provided by author Mao Zegong's false understand and deal with the achievements of civilization of capitalism in his later years was an important reason for the failure in the exploration of the socialist construction.It is important to study Mao Zedong's view of capitalism deeply for finding the reason of Mao Zedong`s failure in his later years and to synthesize the lessons learned. In this paper, on the basis of a brief review of Mao Zedong's understanding of capitalism before 1956, the main performance of Mao Zedong`s total negation of capitalism in his later years were statement from these aspects: political criticism of bourgeois; the total elimination of the capitalist economy; cultural exclusion and the negative achievements of capitalist civilization.The subjective and objective reasons for Mao Zedong`s total negation of capitalism in his later years were analysis from these aspects: the dogmatic understanding of Marxist; the limited understanding of socialism; China's social and historical conditions and the party base; the impact of the US-Soviet Cold War confrontation; international communist movement, as well as limitations of Mao Zedong`s experiences, knowledge structure and way of thinking.The consequences of Mao Zedong`s total negation of capitalism in his later years contained the failure of the theoretical breakthrough of the traditional socialist model of the building of socialism and serious setbacks in the building of socialism in practice.Finally, the conclusion of this paper was that the thought of total negation of capitalism became an obstructive force in the process of reforming and opening up and the use of capitalist is a historical inevitability in the development of socialism and an important experience from the important achievements in the building of socialism with Chinese",1868037353,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, Pei RongZhouRongPeiZhou, Pei Rong", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313669001 , 70609002 , 189128 , 10408728 , 10408728", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868037353?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10408728 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+the+thought+of+the+total+denial+of+capitalism+in+mao+zedong%60s+later+years&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Pei+Rong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments on civil and commercial matters in germany,"Translation from original language as provided by author Globalization in economy fostered free movements of persons and commodities, which requires rights of individuals and legal stability be secured by domestic law. As a result, recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments become a focus in legal studies in different countries. The old belief that for the sake of defending sovereignty, foreign judgment shall not be recognized is not compatible with current social development. The trend of improving legislation and legal practice to respect foreign adjudication has been shown among a lot of countries, while under which condition shall foreign judgment be recognized becomes a major concern. The topic of this dissertation is the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgment in Germany. There are two set of rules for foreign judgments recognition and enforcement. One for foreign judgments rendered in non-EU member states. For this kind of typical foreign judgments, domestic law of Germany will be applied. Another one is those rules applied within EU member states. European Union is the highest form of international organization, which enjoys a more or less supernational character. Part of EU law shall be directly applied in its member states. Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Regulation Brussels Ⅰ)is one example. Regulation Brussels Ⅰtakes priority over domestic laws and other bilateral or multilateral agreements in Germany. In this study, a practical and comparative approach is applied. A combination of theoretical and practical research leads to a systematical introduction of these two set of rules in Germany, which also give some idea for Chinese legislation and legal practice. This dissertation includes four chapters. The first one is a fundamental introduction. It gives some information about basic concept of foreign judgment recognition, and some legal theories. Secondly the legal sources of foreign judgment recognition and enforcement will be examined, which includes two parts, German domestic law(German code of civil procedure) and international law(Brussels Ⅰ). Finally it gives a picture about German legal and judicial system.The second and third chapter is the major part of this dissertation. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments will be introduced separately by non-EU member states and EU member states. The second chapter shows the way a non-EU judgment is recognized or enforced in Germany, including how to define a foreign judgment, under which condition shall it be recognized, and the effect rendered by recognition. Major part of this chapter is the conditions for recognition. German law set off five conditions which are also frequently used by other countries. They are: rendering court has proper jurisdiction; due process in procedure has been satisfied; no incompatible judgments; comply with public policy; reciprocity exist. But in Germany, court has showed a different way in interpreting these rules. Among them, a review in jurisdiction, public policy and reciprocity is especially important. The way German court treat a US punitive judgment, and their interpretation of reciprocity conveys a idea that a German court is willing to recognize foreign judgments by restricting application of those negative conditions, in order to safeguard individual rights and adjudication expenses. Third chapter is about foreign judgment recognition within EU member states. Firstly it goes through the process of unification in civil procedure law in EU, and according to which four principles of foreign judgment recognition and enforcement will be concluded. After some background information of (Brussels Ⅰ) and its improvements compared with Brussels Convention, a study of German legal practice in application of Brussels Ⅰwill be brought out. Germany law has been updated according to EU regulation. Those data, cases and practice in German courts shows that Brussels Ⅰworks efficiently and effectively, which makes the process simple and rapid. Unification of jurisdiction and free movement of judgments will be realized in EU. It proves coordination between different legal systems can be achieved. Last chapter gives some thoughts about what we can learn from German practice. Chinese civil procedure law can be improved by borrow some ideas from German domestic law. Form a comparison between Chinese and European social and legal background, we can see some similarities in between. The successful experience of Brussels Ⅰshow us a mode for resolving our regional legal conflicts. In conclusion, a comparison between these two set of rules in Germany implies German court applies a friendly attitudes towards foreign judgments, according to which suggestion is made for legislation improvements in",1868679973,,Dissertations & Theses," Shuai, YingShuaiYingShuai, Ying", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314355221 , 70607902 , 189128 , 10409903 , 10409903", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868679973?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10409903 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+the+recognition+and+enforcement+of+foreign+judgments+on+civil+and+commercial+matters+in+germany&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shuai%2C+Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on the csr of china's banking sector:boundary assignment and mechanism building,"Translation from original language as provided by author Triggered by the ""Long Line"" problem of banking service, a furious debate on the issue of Corporate Social Responsibility of China's banking sector has risen up in the last couple years. The society and the banking sector have paid more and more attention to this issue. Some banking institutions have actively carried out CSR practices, and banking regulators also have placed high priority to this issue and taken steady steps of promoting the institutions to intensify the CSR cognition, enhance the CSR management. But when it comes to the practices, there are still various shortcomings to overcome which need mechanism for further accomplishment. Started from overlooking the theories on the CSR, the first part of the paper established a theoretical framework to move on the CSR issue. After explaining the particular essence of the banking industry and the unique character and historical development background of China's banking sector, learning from the modern international banking institutions, the second part of this paper elaborates the significance and necessity of carrying out CSR in banking sector. It also elaborates that the movement is the intrinsic need of the sector. The third part moves on to lay out the achievement and shortcomings of the banking sectors' practices, from the perspective of cognition, mechanism, governance structure, information disclosure, outsider guidance. The fourth part reviews the development of China's banking sector. Based on the theory of competitive advantage of Michael Porter, this part lines out the boundary of China's banking sector's CSR practices. The point is that China's banking sector's CSR practices can be divided into three categories as economic responsibilities, issues combining economic responsibility and common values, other issues. And the economic responsibilities takes on the core and turn out to be of the most significance. The last part aims at offering useful reference and advice to advance China's banking sector's practices on CSR from the perspectives of industry strategy, business reengineering, information disclosure, environmental improvement and regulation",1868743209,,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, MinYuMinYu, Min", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314399811 , 111103642 , 189128 , 10320393 , 10320393", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868743209?accountid=14496, 0310 Business administration, 0310 Business administration, 0310 Business administration,, 0310 Business administration, Business administration," (UMI)AAI10320393 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+the+csr+of+china%27s+banking+sector%3Aboundary+assignment+and+mechanism+building&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Min&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The differences in basic education: indicators system between american and chinese local government,"Translation from original language as provided by author This article is mainly about the differences in education indicator system between American and Chinese local government, we mainly use comparative studies, choose several typical local governments which do well in basic education assessment, we will give some advice to improve our basic education assessment, in order to attach  the aims of Education for all-round development. Education quality is the lifeline in enhancing the whole nation' quality, and school assessment which is as a important way to improve education quality is mainly used for supervising the education process and providing education message for administration department. Indicator system which is most crucial in education performance is focal point that will be discussed in this article, and we will take some examples which acts in city governments  between  American and China. First of all, we raise the assumption that inner factors lead to the differences in education indicators between the two countries. Then in the following two chapter we will analyze inner and outer factors which have influence on basic education assessment. outer factors include environment factors like economic, social and institutional variables. Then we will analyze the inner factors. Subjective factors mainly involve value system and education background and so on. And education service intrinsic characters because education is public product are also the inner factors , for example education input comes from government financial incomes ,so it always pursue the input immensely huge. Based on these research we can prove our assumption is right, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages between the two countries and  point out the shortcomings in our basic education assessment. That what are advantages in American education assessment are always our shortcomings, but what are our advantages are always disadvantages in American indicator system. In our indicator system, we are lake of empirical research and efficiency consciousness and so on. These lead to our performance system is in vain or sometimes just formalism. Meanwhile we will give some advice to improve our basic education assessment indicators. But first we analysis the feasibility in our country including changing in whole nation's value and developing of the computer technology and so on. We can try from these aspects: first, we should change our value that not only input and output are important, that results and efficiency are also important, we should transform the traditional thoughts to views from new public management movement. Then while in our country education assessment always adopts qualitative analysis ,we should learn from American which education assessment use quantitative analysis. In addition, the best way is to integrate these two methods, but first you should make sure which indicator can be measured, which aspect can only use qualitative language. Thirdly, we should train the main body of basic education assessment ,help them grasp professional knowledge as well as income experts in public performance. Finally, our government should pay high attention on basic education assessment, which means encourage the public to take part in the basic education assessment, input enough funds and participate in international academic communication which can learn from each other.   In a word, our research try to improve the main body of basic education and provide information for the public sectors to make decision, benefit both school and stakeholders, and finally to help construct a school quality control system.",1868784887,,Dissertations & Theses," Tian, Lin FangTianFangLinTian, Lin Fang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314509921 , 70497592 , 189128 , 10314038 , 10314038", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868784887?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAI10314038 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+differences+in+basic+education%3A+indicators+system+between+american+and+chinese+local+government&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tian%2C+Lin+Fang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on performance-excellence-based local government overall performance evaluation model in china,"Translation from original language as provided by author With the global economic and social development, human's need to handling public affairs diversifies. As the main function of government serving the society, public administration becomes the focus all over the world. In the recent decade, in order to reduce public management cost as well as to improve public management ability, the countries have started a new public management movement. The public has accepted the concepts of ""customer-oriented"", ""cost-oriented"" and ""efficiency-oriented"". Ability and operation quality of the government and other public departments is a critical mission in the 21st century. This paper analysis overall performance evaluation model of China's local government by literature research and historical and found the following questions: the index focus on economic development, the evaluation is spontaneous, the process of evaluation is close, and the standardization of evaluation is not very perfect. There are many reasons to these problems such as: the values of the deviation, the leadership of the system has not yet been established, effective communication mechanisms and information disclosure system has not yet been established, weak institutional basis and so on. Performance excellence model provides a new method of performance evaluation; it has a ""great quality"" value, performance evaluation indicators to enhance the organizational performance, the leadership system and a comprehensive and systematic guide. It's a guiding role for China's local governments to address the issue of performance evaluation model. This paper, base on the excellence performance model, through the analysis of the advantages of excellence performance model, explores the possibility of improving the overall performance evaluation of our local governments based on excellence performance model, compares the practice in China's business and excellent performance reform of local government in the United States, proposes ideas to improve the overall performance evaluation in our local government: make a the values of excellence for China's local governments, design a performance evaluation system to enhance organization, build a strong leadership system, as well as design a guideline of the overall performance for local",1869034719,,Dissertations & Theses," He, Sui HuiHeHuiSuiHe, Sui Hui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314764991 , 111110092 , 189128 , 10394403 , 10394403", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869034719?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAI10394403 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+performance-excellence-based+local+government+overall+performance+evaluation+model+in+china&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=He%2C+Sui+Hui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on robin attfield's biocentric consequentialism,"Translation from original language as provided by author It is Robin Attfield's biocentric consequentialism which beyonds Paul Taylor's biocentrism. In terms of theory, biocentric consequentialism inherits the consequences of the traditional ethics. Moreover, it breaks human-centrism of the traditional consequences and subject-object dichotomy of philosophical epistemology. Biocentric consequentialism provides a typical example for understanding the philosophy of environment and ecological ethics in modern trends. It has a profound background of society for Robin Attfield, who tends to the road of studying environmental philosophy. By the profound social background of the global environmental movement, Robin Attfield has been driven to the road of studying on the philosophy of environment. He has reasonably divided three levels of moral concern into human beings, animals and plants. Humans and animals have the same degree of moral concern, while the degree of moral concern for the two formers are larger than which for plants. Biocentric consequentialism puts forward and confirms the core concept of bio-interests. The concept provides the reason and basis of rights for the man who holds the theory of animals right, at the same time, which suppies a logical supplement for Paul Taylor's the theory of motivation in biocentrism. He proposes and confirms three priority principle of biocentric consequence's evaluation scale, those are the priority of advanced biology, endangered species, and the most benefit of the overall biology. This is the largest protection for the interests of groups and organisms, which has a strong practical significance. It is subversive for individualism of bicocentric consequentialism to holism of ecocentrism. His theory solves the inherent contradictions between ""the utilitarian principle"" and ""the equality principle"", building bridge for conflict of the inherent logic, and the theory has a strong operability in practice. The key points of Robin Attfield's biocentric consequentialism is not constructing an ideal of environment moral, but to the moral means and the reconcile principles for solving the sharp contradiction between the human being and the nature. Biological potentiality and the realization of nature become into a new standard of bio-adaptation to environmentIt. It broadens the discussion which is ""sustainable development"" about the interests of within-generation and inter-generation to the stage of the biological category . To aid poor countries, it provides theoretical support for the safety of environment.

Being the best sample, the Pearl River Delta is one of the highest level urbanization area in China. Large number of towns in PRD are making great change, and transforming from villages towards cities, from traditional society towards modern society. Because of such rapid urbanization process, these towns have to due with many conflict and complex problems, suffering chaos. For example, the public space is one of the key issues. Due to the history reasons, the massive construction of public spaces in the small towns are lack of arrangements with very bad qualities. So it is impossible to solve this problem only by urban plan method. Urban public space is one of the subsystem of city, and will play a very important role to the evolvement of city spaces. There for, public space is one of the major research topics in modern planning and urban design. Based on the logic process from basic concept to practice, this issue intercept ""public space"" as a carrier of the rapid urbanization in the PRD. In the view of history, this dissertation analyze the arrangement, form and character of the public space in PRD during the Ming and Qing dynasty. Being detailed and positive research of the background of institutional change, this paper also do a systematic analysis of modern urban public space and reveals the problems. Based on the contrast of tradition and modern public space in the aspects of form,system,types,meaning, the author point out the function and meaning transforming from Ming dynasty up to date. On the other hand, the global economic process affect the people's need of matter and spirit. The massive population movement in the PRD also brings poignant social reform and blend the cultural diversities. According to the urbanization and globalism, the cultural transforming have great impact on the urban design theories and practice research of China. Based on the theories of planning and cultural geography, the author draw a conclusion about the development method of public space. Lastly, many ideas are suggested: make clear the target of public space; learning from the traditional idea and experience of western countries; build up the public space system in the towns; improve the habitation and preserve historic site and cultural relics, and so on. As a developed area in China, the study on evolvement of Pearl River Delta will play a more and more important role in constructing the public space in the towns during our rapid urbanization",1869045218,,Dissertations & Theses," Mei, Ce YingMeiYingCeMei, Ce Ying", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314823171 , 111110932 , 189128 , 10394182 , 10394182", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869045218?accountid=14496, 0729 Architecture, 0729 Architecture, 0729 Architecture,, 0729 Architecture, Architecture," (UMI)AAI10394182 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+evolvement+of+public+space+in+the+towns+of+pearl+river+delta&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mei%2C+Ce+Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Knowledge level modeling for systemic risk management in financial institutions,"Translation from original language as provided by author The subprime mortgage crisis is an ongoing economic problem characterized by contracted liquidity in the global credit markets and banking system. Many banks, real estate investment trusts (REIT), and hedge funds have suffered significant losses as a result of mortgage payment defaults or mortgage asset devaluation. The current subprime mortgage crisis is a typical case for systemic risk in financial institutions. Systemic risk refers to the risk or probability of breakdown (losses) in individual parts of components and is evidenced by co-movements (correlation) among most or all parts. Many factors contribute to the complexity of the systemic risk management (SRM) in financial institutions at modern society, e.g. financial innovations. So as mentioned by Nobel laureate, Dr. A. Michael Spence, an important challenge in going forward is to better understand these dynamics and complexities of SRM in financial institutions as the analytical underpinning of an early warning system with respect to financial instability. The objective of this thesis is to fill this gap. Knowledge based technologies have been used considerably to solve complex problems during the last few decades. In order to further our understanding and communication about SRM in financial institutions, this thesis proposes a knowledge level model (KLM) for systemic risk management in financial institutions. As first proposed by Newell, the main focus of KLM is to capture and represent knowledge without paying more attention to implementation. There are two parts considered in the proposed KLM are: ontologies and problem solving method (PSM). Ontologies are adopted to represent a knowledge base of KLM, which integrates top level ontology and domain level ontologies. And then the problem solving method is given to show the reasoning process of this knowledge. Further, the details of domain level ontologies for SRM, the focus of which is the contagion effect of systemic risk, are also discussed in this thesis. Three categories of ontologies, including static ontology, dynamic ontology, and social ontology are developed to deal with different perspectives in this domain. The symbol level of KLM is also discussed which integrates OWL, SWRL and JESS. Further, two financial cases are provided to illustrate how proposed KLM is used in financial institutions, including the LTCM case in 1998 and Lehman Brother's minibonds case in 2008. With these, first, they will enhance the interchange of information and knowledge sharing for SRM within a financial institution. Second, they will assist knowledge base development for SRM design, for which a prototype of financial systemic risk management decision support system is given in this study. Third, they will support coordination among different institutions by using standardized vocabularies. And finally, from the design science perspective, the whole proposed framework could be meaningful to models in other",1869119982,,Dissertations & Theses," Ye, KangYeKangYe, Kang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314933971 , 111137412 , 189128 , 10415655 , 10415655", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869119982?accountid=14496, 0488 Inorganic chemistry, 0488 Inorganic chemistry, 0488 Inorganic chemistry,, 0488 Inorganic chemistry, Inorganic chemistry," (UMI)AAI10415655 , Pure sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Knowledge+level+modeling+for+systemic+risk+management+in+financial+institutions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ye%2C+Kang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on gorz's theory of ecological crisis,"Translation from original language as provided by author ""Ecological Marxism"" is a very influential branch school of Western Marxism. They would find the combination with Marxism in ecological crisis and ecological revolution caused. As the global ecological problems gradually becoming serious and outstanding,""Ecological Marxism""has attracted people's widespread attention. Andre Gorz from France is a famous scholar of""Ecological Marxism"". His theory of the ecological crisis includes a series of unique theoretical viewpoints,which not only criticizing the ecological crisis of contemporary capitalist society to directly prove the necessity and the possibility of establishment of socialism, but also making specific and vivid description of utopia prospect of eco-socialism. Today,the ecological crisis has been global and worsened day by day,and has caused the survival of human being to suffer from unprecedented challenge. Thus,the systematical discussion of his theory has a great significance,especially to the construction of socialism modernization in China at present. Therefore,it is necessary to sort out with the excavation the core idea and the basic theory carefully,reveal the value and get rid of its shortage. The thesis has analyzed systematically Gorz's theory,reveal its concrete contents in order to further research to Marxism and provide some useful lessons for Chinese characteristic socialism modernization drive. This thesis consists of three parts. Firstly,the paper has combed the social and historical background and thought resources of Gorz's ecological crisis theory including the Western green movement and theory,the theory on alienation and division of labor of Marxism,Satre's Existential Marxism and the Western ecological theory,all of which provide direct resources for Gorz's theory. Secondly, Gorz has analyzed the contents of his ecological crisis theory: the root of ecological crisis of capitalism is the division labor, science and technology ,Profit motive as well as economic reason. The essence is the root of all crises in capitalist society, and the capitalism crisis is essentially the ecological crisis and the solution is advanced socialism,namely the socialist post-industrial society.

Inflation and deflation are two economic phenomena in fundamental antagonism in the socio-economic life, which have both the differences and linkage. Their linkage lies in their inter-transition under some specific conditions, that is, the inter-transition between inflation and deflation. This state have a profound impact on our social life: it threatens the development of real economy in the field of production, make an unfair transformation of material interests in the field of distribution, make people flagging in investigation and consumption, and, more importantly, make impact on the country's financial stability and security. With the continuous deepening of reform and opening up, China's macro-economy, not only in the 20th century to the mid-80's mid-90's, there have been a number of more serious inflation, but also in the late 90's experienced an unprecedented deflation. In this century, when China's economy is about to come out of deflation, the consumer price index (CPI) continues to climb unexpectedly, and a breakthrough the signs mark of 5% in 2007 which was considered ""serious inflation"", set a new high level since February 1997 for the last 10 years, the inflation comes back to China again after 10-year absence, as long as China's inflation back again unexpectedly. The transition between inflation and deflation has restricted China's economic and social development, and is of grave threat to China's financial stability. Therefore, Concerning about the transition between inflation and deflation, uncovering the reasons of their transition and preventing its happening have been major issues in the theory and practice in our country. To comprehensively implement the concept of scientific development, and to prevent the transition between inflation and deflation, the theory of inflation and deflation are required to advance with the times and to be continuously making innovations. With the ""transition"" as a core, this thesis revealed general characteristics of the transition between inflation and deflation via analysis of definition and related theories of the transition between them. Furthermore, the article explored process and characteristics of the transition between inflation and deflation, analyzed causes of the transition in China and put forward our measures of preventing the transition between inflation and deflation to maintain Chinese financial stability and promote development of a harmonious society. The thesis is divided into five chapters: The first chapter is about the concept of the related theoretical study about the transition between inflation and deflation. The concept of the transition of inflation and deflation is defined and illustrates the related theories of the transition of inflation and deflation Chapter II illustrates the general trajectory, the basic characteristics and their differences on the transition of inflation and deflation. It reveals the general trajectory on the transition of inflation and deflation: the transition from inflation to deflation and from deflation to inflation. It explores the general characteristics and differences on the transition between inflation and deflation. Chapter III presents the process and characteristics on the transition between inflation and deflation in China. It illustrates the process of the transition between inflation and deflation in China and reveals the characteristics of transition between inflation and deflation in China by analyzing each of the performance of the transition process. Chapter IV analyses the reasons on the transition between inflation and deflation in China. It illustrates the transition between inflation and deflation in China occurs under multiple and joint elements: the excessive deviation and the reversed movement between the fictitious economy and real economy; the defect of market systems; the impropriety of macro-control; and international economy. Chapter V is the study of countermeasures to prevent the transition between inflation and deflation in China. We must based on the scientific development concept and realize the scientific development of fictions and real economy in order to lay foundation for the prevention of ""transition between inflation and deflation""; we must improve the socialist market system and its mechanism so as to provide institutional guarantees to prevent the ""transition""; we must implement scientific macro-control in order to provide the right policy support to prevent the ""transition""; and we must achieve balanced economic development both inside and outside in order to create the necessary external conditions to prevent the ""transition""",1869309568,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Jing TongLiTongJingLi, Jing Tong", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314977861 , 111142252 , 189128 , 10458957 , 10458957", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869309568?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10458957 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+transition+between+inflation+and+deflation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Jing+Tong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On epiphany in james joyce's a portrait of the artist as a young man,"Translation from original language as provided by author With the publication of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (A Portrait hereafter) in 1916, James Joyce established his position as a leading figure in the international movement known as realistic modernism. It fully represents Joyce's modern aesthetic concept from the tradition to the innovation and provides the inevitable transitional stage between the ""spiritual epiphany"" in Joyce's Dubliners and the stream of consciousness technique in Ulysses, which is a key example of the Kunstlerroman (artist's Bildungsroman) in English literature, which presents the inner world of the centre character Stephen from childhood to young adulthood. James Joyce delicately traces Stephen from a physically and spiritually embittered childhood through the psychologically restrained adulthood to his eventual pursuit after an art world. Since its publication, A Portrait has caught a lot of critical attention, varying from traditional criticism to various post- modernist views, and received diverse interpretations. The present thesis is an attempt to analyze the novel in the light of epiphany, through which this paper endeavors to figure out why Stephen breaks away from the obsession and achieves sudden revelation. In literature, epiphany, originally a religious term, is a sudden revelation or manifestation that a person experiences usually at a moment of crisis. ""Epiphany"" is a typical feature of the initiation story. It often occurs in a key moment of psychological change, betokening the coming of a climax of the story, and deepening the thematic meaning. James Joyce's epiphany is based on his continuous growing consciousness. He gradually recognizes his own value, pulls through the crisis and reaches the transcendence of his soul. The whole initiation process is achieved after he experiences epiphanies. The thesis includes five parts. To start with, the introduction, sketching the author---James Joyce and briefly introducing his novel--- A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In addition, this part gives a brief introduction to relevant criticism on the novel. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to epiphany, including its origin and development, Joycean epiphany and understanding and reception of Epiphany, pointing out that Joycean epiphany is mostly based on theories of the Austrian doctor Sigmund Freud and Italian Scholastic aesthetician Thomas Aquinas. After that the thesis makes a study of the forms of expression in epiphany, including senses, language and images. The complexity of forms increasingly spirals with the growing ages and gradual maturity. In Chapter 3, the thesis mainly discusses the functions of epiphany. Here the protagonist's main disposition is introduced such as isolation, sensitivity and rebellion which are notable personality to lead to Stephen's production of significant epiphany and in the end he frees from the restrictive social background of Catholic Ireland. Then the elaborate structure arrangements including wave-like movement, curved narration, repetition and diary ending are listed to show Joyce innovation and point out that such structure is just based on the epiphanic mode. The arrangement of the structure aims to express his spiritual suffering, frustration and sense of loneliness living in a depressing and apathetic society. At last the chapter points out that different themes are focused on the major themes: growing consciousness and the flee from the nation, family and religion, and then it further discusses that the epiphany helps to express those themes deeply and efficiently. The last part comes to a conclusion that epiphany makes the characterization deeper, structure arrangements more rational and thematic expression more powerful through analyzing the relationships between epiphany and the characterization, structure and",1869947197,,Dissertations & Theses," Yang, Yong BoYangBoYongYang, Yong Bo", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315454301 , 111142192 , 189128 , 10458753 , 10458753", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869947197?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," (UMI)AAI10458753 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+epiphany+in+james+joyce%27s+a+portrait+of+the+artist+as+a+young+man&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yang%2C+Yong+Bo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on the family law in pakistan,"Translation from original language as provided by author Pakistan is an important country in the south Asia and the Muslim world. At the beginning of the 8th Century, the Arabic forces conquered Pakistan and India, established Islamic regime and introduced the Islamic religion, in which most local residents became Muslims thereafter. Therefore, traditional Islamic religion and Islamic Law play a significant role in the social lives of Pakistani community, and have a profound impact on the family law. Traditional Islamic family law regulates marital system and Muslim women's rights in detail, including engagement, rights and obligations between spouses, divorce, guardianship of children, and recognition of parental rights, which reflects the concern and emphasis of family and women's rights in Quran. Since the neoteric and modern times, as the societal development and change of social conditions, women's movements began to rise and theories of women's human rights were put forward. To seek gender equity and extra protection of women gradually become the aim and purpose of relevant international conventions, as well as domestic family and marital legislation. Pakistan, as a traditional Islamic state, is also in the process. Pakistan prescribes a series of statutes in the family and marital law, including 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act and 1939 Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act under British colonial rule, 1961 Muslim Family Law Ordinance and so on. All of them are dedicated to solve and harmonize the conflicts between traditional Islamic law and modern legal ideas, and protect women's rights particularly. Moreover, the history of being British colony makes common law and case law very important in Pakistan. Hence, Pakistani courts' judgment and decision on plenty of family and marital disputes exert a great influence on the interpretation and implementation of statutory law. This thesis, through a historian and legal perspective, analyze the traditional Islamic family law in Pakistan, the reform of statutory legislation of family and marital law since neoteric and modern times, the most important judgment in the history of Pakistani family law, and the latest development and practice in the system of Pakistani family law, in order to investigate the reasons of these reform and development. This thesis is comprised of four parts. The first part is ""An overview of traditional Islamic family law in Pakistan"", the emphasis of which is the main theories and regulations in the traditional Islamic family law. Family law is a vital part of Islamic law. Traditional family law is on the basis of the original text of Quran and the principles within Quran, and local customs and practice are also blend into traditional family law, which covers broad fields to this end. The second part is ""Reform of family law legislation in Pakistan since neoteric and modern times"", which detailedly illustrates a series of statutory law with regard to family and marital law in Pakistan in the British colonial rule era and after Pakistan's independence, and analyze the reform and development in contrast to traditional Islamic law, especially in terms of the concern and protection of women's rights and status. The reason and positive meaning of the reform are also discussed in this part. The third part is ""Analysis of important judgment in Pakistani family law"". In this part, Pakistan's Judicial system and Pakistani courts' judicial decisions on disputes relating to family and marital law are presented, especially in respect of several significant judgment by the Federal Court since 1980.

However, what accompanies the prosperity is the increasingly intense environmental crisis, the tension between human existence and natural ecology. The reconciliation of this tension is related to the justice between people. The unification of environmental protection and social justice should be achieved to ensure the existence of human beings. This dissertation aims to probe into the possibility to solve this problem. According to the Marxist fundamental of ""existence determining consciousness"", the practical causes for the emergence and development of environmental justice lie mainly in the multi-layer contradictions between human, nature and society resulting from ecological problems and the launch of environmental justice movement. According to the Marxist law that consciousness develops logically, the theoretical background of the emergence and development of environmental justice consists in the following: the theoretical drawbacks and the practical dilemmas of Western environmental ethics objectively offers topics for the research on environmental justice, and the Western Marxist criticism of the nature of anti-ecology and injustice of Capitalism as well as their probe into the eco-socialism which realizes the emancipation of human kind and the unification of nature and human history provide important insights into the approach to environmental justice. Though these practical causes and theoretical background contributed to the emergence and development of environmental justice, how should we establish the theoretical ground and value criteria of environmental justice? We need to examine the various theoretical modes of justice from the perspective of the history of Western thoughts of justice, namely, the teleological mode, the right theory mode, the utilitarian mode and a comprehensive mode. Due to their limitations in integrating environmental protection and social justice, these theories do not constitute the theoretical ground for environmental justice. Therefore, we have to reconsider the theoretical feasibility of environmental justice. This dissertation, from the perspective of the existence and development of the whole human kind and the shift of cultural values against a background of globalization and the perspective of changes in the way of human existence, probes into the theory and practice of environmental justice on the basis of basic theories of philosophy and ethics. It explains the theoretical feasibility of environmental justice as a class justice from perspectives of the properties and principles of environmental justice and the presenting dimensions of environmental justice. Then, it, starting with the relationship between environmental justice and the construction of ecological civilization and that between environmental justice and responsibility of subjects, elaborates on the practical possibility of environmental justice as a class justice. Finally, it reveals the biggest problem of environmental justice, that is, the ethical dilemma in international practice of environmental justice, and points out the means to solve the dilemma according to the class",1874516413,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, BinZhangBinZhang, Bin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318836331 , 111103952 , 189128 , 10522265 , 10522265", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874516413?accountid=14496, 0394 Ethics, 0394 Ethics, 0394 Ethics,, 0394 Ethics, Ethics," (UMI)AAI10522265 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+theory+and+practice+of+environmental+justice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Bin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on philippine democratic socialist party and its development,"Translation from original language as provided by author PDSP was established on May 1st, 1973. In March, 1990, after reaching the legal standards, it became a national party. In 1995, PDSP took part in the Socialist International and elected Norberto B. Gonzales as the chairman. The main supporters of PDSP are workers, peasants, student and merchant. The 36 years development of the Democratic Socialist Party of Philippines can be divided into three main phases: from the 1970s to the mid-1980's, is a phase of anti-Marcos dictatorship, that is, the political and armed struggle phase for democracy and freedom. Late 1980s to late 1990's, Philippines witnessed mass movements rejecting to the president's amending of the Constitution and calling for the maintenance of the democratic constitutionalism. Since the 21st century, PDSP took part in Arroyo's governmental cabinet. In order to gain congressional seats, PDSP took a lot of parliamentary governmental activity. PDSP values justice, solidarity, freedom. It also respects for the core values of religion, equality, peace, participation, progress and health. PDSP established an ideological principle based on a genuine humanitarianism, public wealth and nationalism. Its ultimate aim is to set up a social democratic institutions with equality and justice. The policy of PDSP changed with the needs of the time and the society. At the beginning of the establishment of the party, its policy included: carried out its promise of launching all sorts of struggles; consolidated of democratic socialists Alliance, actively advocated for the fair and the non-aligned, fair international order; promoted voluntary inter-state economic integration process. After the transformation, PDSP learn from the experience of the European Socialist Party, proposed the establishment of a responsible government, committed to respecting for the human rights and civil liberties of all citizens; government should be formed by members elected from the elections at different levels. That is, to take elections by grade, firstly, in the community and then in the local government and at last in the central government. PDSP focus on education for all people, and civic virtue education; respects for religious beliefs and its major activities; actively supports people at the bottom of society and the disabled to get equal economic, political and cultural rights; takes national intervention in the economy and in the market. Since the new century, PDSP proposed a series of political proposals that are closely integrated with the reality in Philippines, such as: to call for an end to armed violence; to promote social reformation; to strengthen patriotism and national moral construction; to concern about human rights; to appeal for a better governance and to carry out political reforms; to continue the land reform, to speed up rural development; to achieve industrialization and to protect labor rights. There are more than 170 parties in Philippine, and it is impossible to list the intricate relationship between each other. Most of them are the parochial parties or traditional affiliated parties. The result on researching the relationship between PSDP and domestic parties in Philippine, which is from three representative parties-- Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats LAKAS-CMD, the federal of PDSP Akbayan Citizens' Action Party, and Communist Party of the Philippines . Through these examples, the writer analyzed and concluded the changing of PSP in the Philippines parties. The current situation of PDSP reflect the common characters which is compromise, election and nonviolence during the Third democratization wave. The power from the army, catholic church break the democracy and rule by law, at the same time restrict the development of PSDP. But the coin is two sides, it also brings the opportunity and which is more than challenge in the view of the international surrounding and the Philippines political setting. Maybe PDSP would be the most important party , got the power or be the biggest opposition party in Philippine during long time developing , just like the socialist party in Brazil and other countries. There would be another result too, as their politic making and the mistakes on the dealing with the relationship with other parties, PDSP would be the less important opposition party or the vassal party of the party in power.

How do these aspirations express both antagonism and forms of relatedness between potentially hostile neighboring groups? How do religious ideals, such as the self-limitations of asceticism, inflect worldly aspirations for a better quality of life? Drawing on twenty months of ethnographic fieldwork in the sub-district of Shahbad (Rajasthan, India), focusing on the Sahariyas, a community of former bonded laborers enmeshed in varying spiritual and material relations and conflicts with neighboring higher status castes and tribes, I ask what aspiration, advancement and a 'higher' quality of life might mean in both religious and secular terms for a lower status group in an unequal, resource-scarce environment. I locate aspiration along two trajectories, power and ethics. Combining an analysis of government documents with participant observation, interviews, household surveys, life histories, ritual data, and narratives of spirit possession, I examine modes of power, which I conceptualize as force, contract and agonistics, and forms of ethical relatedness between the Sahariyas and their neighbors in religious, economic, erotic and dietary terms. I reinterpret 'quality of life' as the relationship between different 'thresholds of life': human, spiritual (the ancestral dead, deities, gods) and non-human (grains, water, animals). Drawing out varied movements between these spiritual and material thresholds of life, I argue that these relations of power and ethics may be understood through concepts of 'political theologies'. I show how aspiration may have very conflicting trajectories, creating both new threats and possibilities in a milieu of scarcity. I clarify how my concepts of power and ethics, of material and spiritual relatedness and conflict, differ both from domination/resistance and postcolonial/identity politics models of competition, and from communitarian 'social capital' frameworks of trust and associational cooperation. Along with the specificities of the ethnographic milieu, I suggest that the concepts of political theology that I draw out gesture towards certain 'global' moral questions to which different religions and secular thought offers diverse responses.",304908654,,Dissertations & Theses," Singh, BhrigupatiSinghBhrigupatiSingh, Bhrigupati", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1954059271 , 41816661 , 66569 , 9781109577457 , 3392385 , 3392385", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109577457, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304908654?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , South Asian Studies , Rural areas , Spirituality , Morality , India"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Aspiration , Comparative religion , Hinduism , India , Political theologies , Rajasthan , Rural India , Rural poverty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gods+and+grains%3A+Lives+of+desire+in+rural+central+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Singh%2C+Bhrigupati&amp;isbn=9781109577457&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Three essays in open economy and international macroeconomics,"This dissertation comprises three essays in open economy and international macroeconomics. The first essay investigates the propagation mechanism of real exchange rate shocks to key real sectors that constitute U.S. foreign trade. The analysis is carried out by decomposing the U.S. trade balance into agriculture, manufacturing and services and evaluating how these sectors respond through the monetary policy channel to a shock in the real exchange rate. A VAR model is constructed using quarterly data of the U.S. foreign trade from 1976Q2 to 2005Q1. The results show that a shock to the real exchange rate has a greater impact on manufacturing and services net trade relative to agriculture. Moreover, the results also indicate, at the sectoral level, that exports are more sensitive to the real exchange rate shocks than are imports. These results are important to researchers using dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models of small open economies because they show transmission features of real exchange rate and monetary policy disturbances to key sectoral components of exports, imports and the trade balance. The second essay employs a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework to an open economy setting in order to investigate the mechanism through which the key sectors of agriculture, manufacturing and services are affected by shocks in the real exchange rates. The essay investigates exchange rate movements as deviations from purchasing power parity, disregarding the changes in the prices of non-tradable goods relative to tradable goods among countries. The results suggest that exchange rate movements are a function of structural parameters that constitute the three sectors of agriculture, manufacturing and services such as labor shares and the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. The third essay examines the key forces driving innovation among entrepreneurs of ICT (information and communications technology) firms within Bangalore, India's leading software city. The essay employs the multinomial logistic technique on qualitative variables related to education, social strata, experience, and diaspora of Indian software entrepreneurs to show empirically their relevance in explaining Schumpeterian innovation in the Indian software industry. This study not only looks at the impact of years of schooling on innovation, but also the types of education received by an entrepreneur, such as technical or commercial type of education, whether the last degree was received from India or from abroad and whether the entrepreneur attended the Indian Institute of Technology. The empirical results indicate that, the level of education, in terms of number of years of schooling and types of education received by an Indian software entrepreneur are statistically significant in explaining innovation in the Indian software industry. The results also show that, more years of experience in the software industry by an entrepreneur, increases the probability that they become innovators and reduces the likelihood of imitation. Moreover, the likelihood of adaptation is invariant to years of experience in the industry. We also investigate whether exposure to foreign technology increases the likelihood of innovation in the industry by examining three types of diaspora networks, that is, living abroad, working abroad and being a CEO abroad at least 6 months before establishing a software company in India. The results suggest that this foreign exposure increases the likelihood of innovation and reduces imitation and adaptation. Among studies of Indian entrepreneurs examining caste, this study is unique in that caste has no statistical significance in explaining entrepreneurship.",304911053,,Dissertations & Theses," Ojede, AndrewOjedeAndrewOjede, Andrew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1922451411 , 46829211 , 66569 , 9781109511697 , 3380409 , 3380409", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109511697, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304911053?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0511 Economic theory"," 0501 Economics , 0511 Economic theory"," 0501 Economics , 0511 Economic theory",," 0501 Economics , 0511 Economic theory"," Economics , Economic theory"," Social sciences , Diaspora networks , Exchange rate transmission mechanism , International macroeconomics , Open economy , Sectoral decomposition , Technology spillovers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+essays+in+open+economy+and+international+macroeconomics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ojede%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781109511697&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The politics of speed: Capitalism, the state and war in an accelerating world","This project investigates how the acceleration of pace across several zones of life affects politics, with specific attention to the areas of democratic governance, war, capitalism, globalization and cosmopolitan activism. Rooted in the works of theorists such as Gilles Deleuze, Sheldon Wolin, Immanuel Kant, Karl Marx, Joseph Schumpeter and Paul Virilio, it seeks to investigate the challenges which acceleration places to the practice of politics, as well as the opportunities it might provide in fostering democratic governance, economic equality and pluralist social orientations. Most accounts of acceleration fall into one of two camps; pro-speed or anti-speed. In the pro-speed camp, the acceleration of the pace of life is seen as a wellspring of increased global productivity, efficiency, economic equality and by extension, democracy and humanitarianism. Conversely, the anti-speed camp sees in speed merely the acceleration of violence, exploitation and oppression. Contemporary narratives of speed thus tend to fall into either a generalized utopianism or dystopianism. The philosophy of speed which this project seeks to develop breaks from the unilinear narrative of both these accounts by identifying a fundamental ambiguity in the character of acceleration. This ambiguity is located in a distinction (developed by Deleuze and Guattari) between speed and velocity. Whereas velocity is a quantitative metric, speed describes a qualitative movement, a singular and unpredictable swerve which brings with it the emergence of the radically new. As a result of this, acceleration tends to unsettle stable narratives unfolding mechanically in linear time. This unsettling character of speed can provoke a sense of resentment amongst those who are uncomfortable with the idea of a world of becoming, and lead to occasionally oppressive and violent attempts to suppress this fount of change and uncertainty. Though this project does not seek to ignore the violence that can develop from acceleration, it does hope that an attentiveness to the newness of acceleration can help us to ward off fascistic desires for control and reactionary drives for violent deceleration, while also leaving us open to search for new opportunities within speed which might foster more democratic and pluralistic tools and orientations.",304914168,,Dissertations & Theses," Glezos, SimonGlezosSimonGlezos, Simon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1638832901 , 41785991 , 66569 , 9780549937340 , 3339718 , 3339718", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780549937340, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304914168?accountid=14496," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Philosophy , Political science , International law"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Capitalism , Deleuze, Gilles , Globalization , Speed and acceleration , Technology , The War Machine , Virilio, Paul , War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+speed%3A+Capitalism%2C+the+state+and+war+in+an+accelerating+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Glezos%2C+Simon&amp;isbn=9780549937340&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The meaning of development of Filipinos by Filipinos in diaspora: Rhetorical vision in participatory communication,"Development is currently one of the drivers of international migration resulting in south-to-north or third-to-first world movements of immigrants seeking for a better life in more developed countries. Consequently, new economic diaspora communities are being formed, most of which help alleviate poverty of relatives back home through regular remittances, now considered an important source of foreign capital in many developing economies. Amidst new challenges for the field of development is the question of the relevance of development communication in migration and diaspora. This exploratory study investigates the role of participatory development communication in expanding diaspora contributions to their home countries. Using the focus group method within the participatory communication for development framework, I conducted 12 focus groups participated by first-generation Filipino immigrants from Fargo, North Dakota, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, two communities located in the northern border between the United States and Canada. I documented and analyzed their meanings of development and their understanding of the current state, problems, solutions and vision for Philippine development. I used Bormann's (1985) narrative-based theory of rhetorical vision to analyze how symbolic convergence played out in the participatory communication dialogues, theorizing ""rhetorical participatory communication"" as a means and a process of achieving social change. I also provided implications of the focus group method for participatory communication research and accentuated the roles of ""engagement"" of the focus group facilitator. Results showed that Fargo participants viewed development from the lenses of modernization while Winnipeg participants applied a reformed modernization framework. Corruption was top on the list of development problems in the Philippines and solutions included removal of corrupt and inept leaders and a spiritual revolution transforming Filipino cultural identity. Analysis of the elements of rhetorical vision in participatory communication dialogues showed possibilities for sustainable commitment and greater involvement of participants to a common vision needed in community building. Implications of the focus group method on participatory communication include its capacity to reinforce the participatory principles of dialogue, knowledge-sharing, conscience-raising, empowerment and multiplicity. Focus group facilitators may well maximize their ""engagement"" roles as equalizer, prompter, prober, conscientiser, knowledge broker, advocate and catalyst, and synthesizer to enhance participatory dialogues.",304960884,,Dissertations & Theses," Lofranco, Louella LimLofrancoLimLouellaLofranco, Louella Lim", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1914356011 , 49728771 , 66569 , 9781109465648 , 3383395 , 3383395", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109465648, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304960884?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0501 Economics , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0501 Economics , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0501 Economics , 0708 Mass communications",," 0459 Communication , 0501 Economics , 0708 Mass communications"," Communication , Economics , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Development communication , Diaspora , Diaspora and development , Filipinos , International communication , Participatory communication , Rhetorical vision",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+meaning+of+development+of+Filipinos+by+Filipinos+in+diaspora%3A++Rhetorical+vision+in+participatory+communication&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lofranco%2C+Louella+Lim&amp;isbn=9781109465648&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Girls' Education Movement (GEM): Study of program implementation and partnerships for education development in Cape Town, South Africa","Creating safe learning environments and gender equality for girls is a major development issue in South African secondary schools. Though 70% of South African children aged 14–17 go to secondary school, girls have reported feeling unsafe in the school environment. A variety of partnerships and initiatives have been developed in efforts to reduce the violence in schools and create a safe learning environment. These partnerships and initiatives have facilitated the establishment of policies that promote social, economic, and educational development. This study investigates the efficacy of the implementation of the Girls’ Education Movement (GEM) intervention. The study investigates the school environments and the relationships between learners, teachers, and program partners to assess the efficacy of the GEM implementation. This research focuses on a narrow form of partnership in which government (South African National Department of Education) and the regional office of an international multilateral organization (UNICEF South Africa) collaborate to address South Africa’s gender issues in schools through GEM. This comparative case study was conducted in two secondary schools in Cape Town, South Africa. The schools and participants are from two school communities that are violent. This purposeful sample is reflective of the schooling environment in which the GEM intervention is implemented. The primary research questions examine the efficacy of the GEM initiative as an intervention model program, how the partnership between UNICEF and DOE functions, and its roles and responsibilities. The study also seeks to identify and understand the opportunities and challenges of the partnership and how the partnership affects program implementation. This case study approach uses qualitative methods—interviews, program observation, focus groups, and questionnaires—to research the implementation of GEM at the nation provincial and local level. The study examines the engagement and coordination of the partnership and its ability to contribute to education development by operationalizing the GEM initiative. The findings from this study suggest that there are many concerns in building and sustaining a partnership for education development. The findings also reveal a panoramic view of real challenges that impede a successful partnership between UNICEF South Africa and the South African National Department of Education’s efforts to employ the GEM initiative and to create safe schooling for learners. This study adds to the literature recommendations and strategies to mitigate the challenges of building partnerships. Some suggestions for policy and practice include (1) establish stakeholders with clearly outlined parameters from the onset of the partnership, (2) implement effective strategies for successful partnership building and program implementation, (3) develop and sustain consistent and continuous communication for the duration of the partnership, (4) set incremental stages of evaluation of the partnership and program and allow for midstream adjustments based on the results.",304984070,,Dissertations & Theses," Wilson, Felicia ReneeWilsonReneeFeliciaWilson, Felicia Renee", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1883501691 , 49053441 , 66569 , 9781109375114 , 3374565 , 3374565", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109375114, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304984070?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0514 School administration , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0514 School administration , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0514 School administration , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0514 School administration , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , School administration , Social structure , Girls , Education , Cape Town South Africa"," Social sciences , Education , Cape Town , Education development , GEM , Girls education , Girls' Education Movement , Partnerships , Program implementation , School violence , South Africa , UNICEF , Violence in school",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Girls%27+Education+Movement+%28GEM%29%3A+Study+of+program+implementation+and+partnerships+for+education+development+in+Cape+Town%2C+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+Felicia+Renee&amp;isbn=9781109375114&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""National identity, political engagement, and electoral political participation: A case study of Taiwan","This dissertation discusses the “construction” and “enhancement” of national identity and its relevance and “implications” for political participation and uses Taiwan as a case study. Among other things, the uniqueness, diversity, complexity, importance, urgency, and criticality of national identity in Taiwan motivates the author to examine national identity’s formation, enhancement, and implications for political participation by using the Taiwan case in particular. In terms of the formation of Taiwan’s national identity, this dissertation broadens the traditional way of measuring national identity in Taiwan. Not only are self-identity and attitudes toward China incorporated, but also party identification, ethnicity, and language are newly added into the so called “national identity cleavage variable” based on the primordialism, instrumentalism, and constructivism on national identity. The above three approaches to national identity also represent the main cleavages in Taiwan’s society. In terms of the enhancement of Taiwan’s national identity, this dissertation applies the rational choice theory and emphasizes the two exogenous pillars, economic confidence and consolidated democracy. Long-term focused endogenous factors like ethnicity not only have an effect on a pro-Taiwan national identity, but also other factors such as Taiwanese evaluations of economical and political performances matter as well. In terms of the relationship between national identity and political participation, the newly added national identity related variables synthesized with the socio-economic model, the political engagement part of the civic voluntarism model, and the economic confidence and consolidated democracy model will be able to explain better the specific political participation in Taiwan in 2001. Particularly, attitudes toward China have a statistically significant effect on voting, while political engagement factors are significant to campaign activity. This suggests that people in Taiwan are highly psychologically oriented. Both voting and campaign activity belong to separate types of electoral political participation based on different nature. The partisanship factor also matters in all types of political participation in this study except contact, meaning Taiwan still has a traditional type of political participation. In terms of methodology and data, this dissertation applies ordinary least squares, logistic regression, and ordered logistic regression on the Asian Barometer data collected in Taiwan in 2001 based on different characteristics of the dependent variables. This dissertation is designed to develop a new way of observing national identity from a cleavage point of view for application in future studies; a traditional single approach would only emphasize self-identity or attitudes. Some of the more important findings of this dissertation are as follows: First, globally, Taiwan’s national identity is vertically in the conflict stage while horizontally, social, political, and cultural aspects are significant to discuss in order to represent the multi-dimensional perspectives. Second, because of the new emphasis of the exogenous economic confidence and consolidated democracy factors on a pro-Taiwan national identity, it is hoped that the findings of this study will encourage elites and political parties to utilize a positive and rational mobilization strategy rather than a negative and harmful one during elections. Also, it is the state level and current and future economic confidence that enhance a pro-Taiwan national identity rather than mere past economic achievements. Third, this study identifies and relies on four complementary models for explaining Taiwan’s electoral and non-electoral political participation. The role of the political party reflecting social cleavage, particularly national identity in the Taiwan case, changes its focus from encouraging the opposition movement in the past to facilitating political participation now and in the predictable future. To understand and explain national identity in Taiwan is not only an inevitable task in domestic politics but also an unavoidable challenge in improving its international status. Through this dissertation, the author hopes to encourage a more diverse angle of observing national identity cleavages in Taiwan, a wider possibility of explaining a pro-Taiwan national identity enhancement, and a newly emphasized national identity scope of explaining political participation.",305032809,,Dissertations & Theses," Chang, TingChangTingChang, Ting", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1897698331 , 49407051 , 66569 , 9781109442250 , 3381174 , 3381174", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109442250, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305032809?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science," Political science , Social identity , Nationalism , Elections , Case studies , Taiwan"," Social sciences , China , Consolidated democracy , Economic confidence , National identity , Political participation , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=National+identity%2C+political+engagement%2C+and+electoral+political+participation%3A+++A+case+study+of+Taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chang%2C+Ting&amp;isbn=9781109442250&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A history of marginality: Nature and culture in the western Himalayas,"This dissertation traces the history of the dialectical relationship between centre and margins in a remote mountainous region of Hunza in what is now in northern Pakistan, exploring in particular the politics of representation over time and the material consequences in the region. The dissertation is an interdisciplinary effort, bringing together environmental studies, anthropology and history. It begins in the era of the Great Game—the 19th century struggle between the British and Russian empires for control of the tract of land between South and Central Asia—on the northern frontiers of British India. It ends in the contemporary period, exploring the interactions between Hunza communities in the area and global environmentalist discourse and practice, within the ambit of the modern nation state, particularly in the context of the creation, in 1975, of the Khunjerab National Park in the area. Using Derrida's conception of a stable and ever present center, I argue that the center needs margins to provide stability and coherence to its own social categories: it must be placed in opposition or difference to an ‘other’, a marginal other. The function of the center in this self-other relation is to limit the possible ‘play’ of the meaning, or identity, of the self, thus fixing it in relation to the other. This dialectical construction of the self and the other involves the presence of a conceptual boundary between the two. In this dissertation I have argued that the center used the nature/culture boundary to construct its own self identity in relation to Hunza. This dissertation shows that nature/culture boundary is not rigid rather there is a pattern of movement in its tension which is associated with changing politics and major intellectual paradigms at the center. When the centers were sure of their own political power and/or the people of Hunza appeared as threatening to their power the boundary between nature and culture was often strict and rigid. When the people of Hunza appeared unthreatening to the center and/or the centers were themselves unsure of their power, the nature-culture boundary was often less rigid and the center allowed this boundary to be breached and important connections to be made across them. This status of this boundary—a boundary in tension—can be considered in terms of ‘play’ in the Derridian structure. Thus we notice that during the times when the boundaries were less rigid, the identities of the outsiders and the people of Hunza became fluid, sometimes overlapping, at others held in a relationship of neutral but positive difference. When the boundaries were rigid, the identities of the people of Hunza and outsiders became more rigid and fixed, that is, less playful. The dissertation shows that through history, the people of Hunza have played a role in the maintenance and relative play (rigidity and permeability/flexibility) in these boundaries from their own cultural logic. The interactions between them and the centers have however had different consequences depending upon how the act of boundary making and boundary breaking was perceived by the outsiders and the magnitude of transgression.

Systematic theologies dictate not only how one should understand God, but also how one should understand himself and his neighbor. In this way religion may serve as a foundation of core values and as a means of identity construction; translating into worldviews, political orientations and policy agendas. Premillennialism, a theology of the end times, may serve this function for individuals who have been socialized within its tradition. As such, it is potentially politically significant. Proponents suggest that this eschatology forecasts the rise of a political and religious leader (Antichrist1) who sweeps over the geopolitical and economic landscape ushering in the end of days. Premillennialists argue that the disasters and political turmoil of the present put us on the cusp of this final era in human history. The political potential of this theology is evident in that it has been popularized in New York Times best selling books, is the eschatology of several large denominations and is held by influential figures within the Christian Community. A close reading of the premillennial narrative suggests for those socialized within this tradition a deep contention with the globalization, secularizing, authoritarian, environmentalist and anti-Semitic tendencies at play on the world’s stage. This project examines premillennialism as a significant theological strand in American politics among elites and the mass public. It offers a history of these doctrines in American political development at four key moments (1) Miller and the Millerite movement of the 1830s and 40s, (2) the fundamentalist movement of the 1920s, (3) the rise of evangelicalism and the Christian Right in the 1980s, and (4) premillennialism at the millennium and beyond. I present a theory of premillennial subcultural identity and its function as a set of core values. Three empirical chapters follow. The first offers an evaluation of the political consequences of elite communication of premillennial political messages on the World Wide Web using web-based social network analysis. The second chapter employs ethnographic techniques (in-depth interviews as well as participant observation at premillennial events and of premillennial communities on the internet) in an exploration of premillennialism as a politically vibrant subculture. The final makes use of experimental assessment in understanding the role of premillennialism in shaping attitudes about politics. The project concludes with a summary of research findings and a discussion of the role of premillennialism in the American political landscape. 1 The Antichrist is one of the most central characters in the premillennial narrative. After the rapture the Antichrist comes to power as the head of a global government, economy and religion. This figure is responsible for the suffering faced by individuals who convert after the rapture and it is in response to the depravity which he encourages and exemplifies that the judgments of God are released on the world in the 7 year period known as the Great Tribulation.",305050477,,Dissertations & Theses," Booke, Paula NicoleBookeNicolePaulaBooke, Paula Nicole", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1858689721 , 42960661 , 66569 , 9781109312782 , 3369308 , 3369308", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109312782, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305050477?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science",," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science"," Religion , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christian conservativism , Network analysis , Political psychology , Premillennialism , Religion and politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Politics+of+the+apocalypse%3A+The+effect+of+premillennial+eschatology%0Aon+American+political+behavior&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Booke%2C+Paula+Nicole&amp;isbn=9781109312782&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Surfaces of sand and stone: Unearthing the origins of modern Korean painting in the archaeological remains of the past,"The South Korean art world in 1953 was not unique in facing the onslaught of questions of identity, nation, and art practice raised by conflict and colonization. These issues and artistic approaches mirror similar developments throughout the globe during the middle part of the 20th century. As such, the development of South Korean modern painting can be understood as part of simultaneous processes occurring throughout East Asia, Latin America, and indeed, the United States and Europe in the mid part of the twentieth century. South Korea’s political and social upheaval was a function not only of the competing interests and perceived rivalries between the South and North, but between Korea and Japan, and more broadly, the East and the West. For this reason, an examination of this formative period in modern Korean art and its intersection with global art movements is particularly instructive. Through a series of case studies that link together a foundational exhibition of Korean artifacts, the 1957 show Masterpieces of Korean Arts , and the work of two important Korean artists of the period, Park Soo Keun and Kim Whanki, I argue this post-war discourse between the past and present was actively shaped by artists and museum curators who sought to define visions of a Korean past untainted by the travails of the twentieth century. This longing manifested itself in the search for origins, traditions, and archetypes of an enduring and unbroken Korean history located in the material remains of everyday life. The present shaped the past, but the past in return shaped the present. This dissertation examines the contingent, selective, and self-conscious use of the past in the development of South Korea’s national museum and the modern arts in the post-colonial, post-civil war period following 1953.

Culture is now widely viewed as a critical factor in the economic and social health of cities. Notions of creativity and the growing recognition of the role that culture-rich environments can play in attracting the “creative class,” are being partly expressed in the widespread adoption of urban cultural planning strategies. Cultural planning is commonly defined as the identification (mapping) and leveraging of cultural assets to support local community and economic development. It is also often explained as a “cultural approach” to municipal planning, an approach that entails effective cross-departmental and cross-sectoral collaboration in the implementation of strategic goals outlined within the cultural plan. A literature has been written on the potential of cultural planning by leading experts in the cultural policy field, especially from Australia and Britain. However, there has been a noticeable lack of critical research on this cultural development approach by scholars in Canada, where cultural planning is a relatively new and emerging municipal activity. This dissertation examines the policy and planning scope of the increasingly popular yet under-explored “municipal cultural planning” movement in Ontario, Canada. Research began with a thorough review of the cultural planning literature. Cultural planning deficiencies and research gaps identified in the international literature were subsequently addressed through an analysis of all ten existing cultural plans in Ontario's mid-size cities. The analysis of plans was complemented by thirteen in-depth interviews with municipal staff responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of cultural plans. Aside from addressing the interpretations of and rationales for municipal cultural planning, the information derived from document analysis and interviews was used to address four important issues that have been either ignored or only addressed in a cursory way in the literature: the nature and actual extent of community consultation and cultural mapping in the cultural plan development stage; the accuracy of the growing arts policy labelling of cultural planning abroad as it applies to municipal cultural planning; the relationship between cultural planning and its conceptual roots in urban planning; and the outcomes of the cultural planning strategy. It was found that the development of cultural plans involved substantial community input, albeit not through the participatory “cultural mapping” process that is often claimed to be the preliminary step of cultural planning. In addition, it was observed that the increasingly common charge, particularly from Australia, that cultural plans are overly focussed on traditional arts sector concerns was not found to be the case with most cultural planning initiatives in Ontario. Further, while a strong urban development and planning-oriented basis has been used to differentiate cultural planning from traditional arts policy, the scope of cultural planning concerns in the sphere of urban planning practice was observed to be, with some noticeable exceptions, fairly superficial. However, this research also found that the strategic objectives outlined within cultural plans, which address a broad range of policy and planning activities related to cultural and community development, were generally being implemented and were effecting change.",305148451,,Dissertations & Theses," Kovacs, Jason F.KovacsF.JasonKovacs, Jason F.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1958123311 , 50405611 , 66569 , 9780494561331 , NR56133 , NR56133", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494561331, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305148451?accountid=14496, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning,, 0999 Urban planning, Urban planning," Social sciences , Cultural planning , Municipal planning , Ontario",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+cultural+turn+in+municipal+planning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kovacs%2C+Jason+F.&amp;isbn=9780494561331&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An investigation of reasons for finland's success in pisa,"The Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, administered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, surveyed fifteen-year-olds for the first time in 2000. PISA focuses on mathematics, science, and reading literacy, and intends to undertake a new study every three years. The administration in 2003 added a section that measured problem-solving skills. The results from all three surveys thus far have placed Finland as the highest achieving country in PISA. Finland’s top performances in PISA astonished the educational world. More so than previous cross-national surveys such as TIMSS and PIRLS, PISA has drawn worldwide educational interest towards Finland and its educational system. PISA, unlike TIMSS, does not measure mastery of curriculum, but rather outcomes of education. PISA focuses on real-life applications of knowledge. Triggering global curiosity, the PISA has placed Finland on the itinerary of those wishing to discover the influences behind educational success. This research focuses upon Finland’s historical, cultural, and social context as a part of the Nordic countries and also its immense success in PISA. This project uncovers some of the factors contributing to Finland’s success in education, as indicated by the results in PISA. Finland’s history as a part of both Sweden and Russia has intertwined education with the movement for independence. The struggles after independence, including war and recession, have also reinforced the importance of education within Finnish society. The important status of teachers in Finland, in addition to their high quality, has further enhanced the excellence of the Finnish education system. PISA findings, however, have indicated that the Swedish-speaking Finns score lower than the Finnish-speaking Finns, a phenomenon explored within the research. This project investigates the reasons behind this counterintuitive result. The project incorporates perspectives through interviews with teachers and head teachers from the six sample schools, both Swedish-speaking and Finnish-speaking, Finnish education ministers, PISA creators from the OECD, and Finnish educational researchers and professors responsible for executing PISA in Finland. Their insight, from many different points of view, illuminated different perspectives on PISA and education in Finland.",898749523,,Dissertations & Theses," Chung, JenniferChungJenniferChung, Jennifer", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488076871 , 64934821 , 101309 , U504419 , U504419 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:62b7a22f-d930-4eb0-893d-d703fd9d182d", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898749523?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0515 Education, Education," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:62b7a22f-d930-4eb0-893d-d703fd9d182d , 508763 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+investigation+of+reasons+for+finland%27s+success+in+pisa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chung%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Art, advertising and politics: the artists’ crisis of connection 1931-1945","This thesis seeks to evaluate the link between art, advertising and politics in the interwar period in Britain, exploring attempts by artists of different visual media to connect with the people.  Public manipulation is explored through an examination of a perceived artists’ crisis which sought to re-connect the artistic elite with the people, through shaping, reflecting and directing consciousness.  The task taken up by the thesis is to establish the political homogeneity of the goals of oppositional artistic groups, and to highlight the paradoxical nature of the use of advertising techniques, despite the threat of commercial art to elite artists.  The primary objective of the thesis is to highlight the artists’ crisis as an important event in the cultural and social history of the period.  The centrality of antifascism as the dynamic for the crisis, and the importance of advertising in the crisis are key arguments within the thesis. The evaluation focuses on the cultural impetus of advertising on political consciousness in the period, and its effect on artistic output on canvas and film.  This is demonstrated through an examination of the antifascist art work of members of the Artists’ International Association, which is compared with advertising techniques from the same period, in particular the advertising work of Shell-Mex Oil Company.  The ambiguities surrounding the self-professed elite and their relationship with the mass are highlighted by the exploits of the neo-realist artists.  These artists, who sought public connection through a stance of reflecting society to enable change, are evaluated together with the mass-observation movement and its artistic experiments.  The influence of mass-observation and the Artists’ International Association on war propaganda is explored through examination of the visual propaganda created by the Ministry of Information, which highlights the increasing influence of corporate advertising on the political arena.",898751365,,Dissertations & Theses," Allen Edwards, J.P.Allen EdwardsJ.P.Allen Edwards, J.P.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488106311 , 64939051 , 101309 , U503087 , U503087", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898751365?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," (UMI)AAIU503087 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Art%2C+advertising+and+politics%3A+the+artists%E2%80%99+crisis+of+connection+1931-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Allen+Edwards%2C+J.P.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Institutional configurations and access to critical resources: a comparative study of the innovation strategies of British and Dutch dedicated biotechnology firms,"This research is framed in the comparative capitalism literature and investigates how entrepreneurs in the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry acquire financial resources and management expertise from their national institutional frameworks.Â  Focusing on British and Dutch dedicated biotechnology firms (DBFs), this research offers insight into several aspects of (pharmaceutical) biotechnology entrepreneurship.Â  First, the idea of a â��purelyâ�� radical biotechnology industry is challenged and â��typicalâ�� business models are identified distinguishing between the level of uncertainty in these business models and the level of appropriability risk.Â  Findings show there are varying levels of technological uncertainty in DBF business models and firms in institutional contexts that constrain access to critical resources use these models as a â��growth rateâ�� from relatively low-risk strategies to relatively high-risk strategies.Â  Main findings show there is a relationship between the type of business model and the type of financing path followed.Â  In addition, the type of financing path followed is contingent on the capabilities and experience of the founding management team.Â  For example, British DBFs that originated from industry environments and had highly experienced founding management teams and executive board members bypassed venture capital and raised external financing through public equity exclusively. In contrast Dutch cases show how firms, faced with constraints in the financial and labour systems, create alternative paths in order to follow high-risk innovation strategies.Â  In terms of financial resources, Dutch DBFs use international sources to secure financing.Â  In terms of managerial expertise, Dutch founders struggle to acquire the appropriate managerial expertise due to the lack of a robust social network that facilitates the movement of labour.Â  Dutch founders, therefore, rely primarily on their own skills to fulfil various roles of a management team for a much longer time.",898752529,,Dissertations & Theses," DiVito, L.DiVitoL.DiVito, L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

This tension is especially apparent, and holds particular significance, with respect to women’s changing status and role. Driving this research is a concern to examine the impact that structural reforms and neoliberalism are having on women’s everyday experience of autonomy at home, in their careers and family life, and in the journeys they make from home to work through public spaces. This thesis focuses on the specific case of Assam, located in the north-eastern region of India and, within it, a sub-population of young, middle class, Assamese women. The research draws on in-depth interviews and focus groups, in triangulation with a standardised questionnaire, conducted with a sample of students pursuing higher education in five different state-funded co-educational institutions of Assam namely Cotton College, Gauhati Medical College, Assam Engineering College, Gauhati University and Bajali College which have long histories of privilege and prestige. This research is designed to look for evidence of improved status in an extreme context where the liberating benefits of education and career salience are most likely to be found. A key contribution of this thesis flows from the contradictions and complexities of the everyday practices that underpin the changing status and role of young, middle class Assamese women. The narrative analysis reveals contradictory processes underpinning women’s changing status in Assam; on one hand it shows higher education to be liberating for those who can afford access, in as much as it offers increased autonomy and exposure to international media and ‘cosmopolitan’ egalitarian ideals; on the other hand, women who seek fulfilling jobs and careers outside the home find their freedom of movement severely restricted in public by sexual harassment and at home they face continuing pressure to maintain labourintensive standards of cooking and childcare. This coincides with tensions arising from ‘new femininities’ whereby, for many within Assamese society, the participation of women in higher education and their increased visibility in paid employment is symbolic of the advancing threat of globalisation as is the proliferation of ‘immodest’ (western) modes of dress; loss of extended family welfare; and an erosion of cultural practices and religious beliefs. The research, which is an empirical contribution to existing knowledge, examines the ways that incomplete gender transformations are embedded in Assamese society. Generally it is perceived that Indian women’s subordination is explained with reference to a biological ‘naturalisation’ of sex roles or dominant patriarchal structures in state, market and family relations. This thesis challenges these perceived notions of traditional explanations by pointing to a trend of ‘Third Wave’ feminism circumscribed by plural ‘new femininities’ and ‘girl power’. At the same time the research engages with the critique of tradition identified by Hobsbawm (1983) as a variable rather than a fixed or static concept. It demonstrates that Assamese women are effectively experiencing a (re)traditionalising of their domestic roles with increased ‘Indianness’ in the social (re)production of daily life. Thus, the research also contributes to the theoretical literature on postcolonial feminism by following Mohanty’s (1987, 1988; 1991b) critique of the universality of ethnocentricism in Anglo-American scholarship and its presumptions that women of the so called Third World accept traditions passively. Evidence of the (re)production of a mix of ultra modern and perceived notion of traditional practices is presented with respect to competing spheres of daily life; including relationships with parents/in-laws and spouse, childcare, norms of domestic labour and personal goals associated with education and career. The manifestation of this process is locally specific and highly uneven and contradictory.",898787203,,Dissertations & Theses," Bhattacharyya, RituparnaBhattacharyyaRituparnaBhattacharyya, Rituparna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488280371 , 64973631 , 101309 , U505239 , U505239 , http://hdl.handle.net/10443/303", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898787203?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0630 Public policy, Public policy," http://hdl.handle.net/10443/303 , 500938 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Examining+the+changing+status+and+role+of+middle+class+assamese+women%3A+lessons+from+the+lives+of+university+students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bhattacharyya%2C+Rituparna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Straddling different social worlds: an analysis of the communication and organisationl strategies of stop huntingdon animal cruely ( shac),"This thesis is a sociological enquiry into the militant animal rights group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC), a protest organization established in 1999 with the sole aim to force the closure of Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS).Â  This study examines the position of SHAC within the UKâ��s animal rights scene and the status of the campaign within international protesting.Â  It explores the backgrounds, attitudes, motivations and central concerns of SHAC activists, in the context of a number of sociological debates. The main theoretical consideration is to provide an alternative paradigm through which to explore the role of new media and associated activist media within new social movement mobilisation and protest cultures.Â  It is claimed SHACâ��s communication system is an extension of â��prod-usageâ�� in action, whereby SHACâ��s conscious deployment of new media and Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) strategically facilitates political activity across varying spatio-temporal locations.Â  SHAC activists are encouraged to participate in a range of protest communications from â��calls to actionâ��, published in its media to broaden and widen participation in the campaign, though to Animal Liberation Front-branded actions encompassing intimidation of those â��named and shamedâ�� in SHAC media literature. Findings have been informed by an ethnographic study of UK animal rights protesters which involved participant observation of meetings, demonstrations, and other protest events over an eleven month period, as well as structured interviews with significant campaigns and spokespersons belonging to and with knowledge of SHAC.Â  This is complemented by structured interviews held with prominent figures from the political and legal worlds and leading industrial players with first-hand experience of SHACâ��s campaign.",898794502,,Dissertations & Theses," Upton, AndrewUptonAndrewUpton, Andrew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2488280651 , 64973861 , 101309 , U510730 , U510730", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898794502?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," 517881 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Straddling+different+social+worlds%3A+an+analysis+of+the+communication+and+organisationl+strategies+of+stop+huntingdon+animal+cruely+%28+shac%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Upton%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Act locally, affect globally: an ethnographic study of an international non-governmental organization","This dissertation presents the ethnography of a peace and human rights organization in order to address the question: How is meaning managed within the diverse and complex transnational non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have come to shape the global peace and human rights agenda. This dissertation employs a â��processual view of culture as activityâ�� (Hannerz 1992: 17) in order to analyze the extent to which NGO members are possessors of, and possessed by particular systems of meaning.Â  The empirical basis of this research rests upon three years of fieldwork within the NGO sector and the activist networks associated with these organizations. By focusing on the intimate processes of meaning management both within a specific NGO and also within the private lives of its members and supporters, this dissertation offers a nuanced picture in which historical, social, life history, religious and philosophical factors combine to create parallel streams of meaning within and across the organization. First, the dissertation identifies and describes idealists â�� an important but virtually unknown group of people within the NGO sector.Â  Second, by examining the influence of these idealists within a particular NGO and beyond, this dissertation describes in detail a range of methods and techniques by which meaning can be created and managed within and beyond the NGO sector.Â  Third, this dissertation explains the processes by which a meaning system â�� in this case idealism â�� can endure across history and be transmitted not only from one NGO to another, but also from one movement era to another.Â  Fourth, by describing how even skilful and deliberate managers of meaning, such as idealists, are to some extent possessed by something akin to an â��idealist cultureâ��, this dissertation illuminates the actor-structure nexus as it applies to the complexities of human life today.",899736377,,Dissertations & Theses," Carlarne, J.CarlarneJ.Carlarne, J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491212541 , 64929381 , 101309 , U515582 , U515582", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899736377?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," 519753 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Act+locally%2C+affect+globally%3A+an+ethnographic+study+of+an+international+non-governmental+organization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carlarne%2C+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On the ruins of utopia: the political aesthetics of the armenian avant-garde,"This project aims to examine contemporary art production in Armenia since the late 1980s within the turbulent transformations from state socialism to market economy in post- Soviet Armenia. I argue that it is precisely those contexts and artistic initiatives that have failed to be incorporated into the valuation system of the international art market that harbor potential for radical art and emancipatory forms of subjectivisation. This study aims to shed a light upon the context of artistic production in Armenia which largely emerged between the ruins of the utopia of the socialist project and the failure to realize the romanticized consumerism of the capitalist West. This project is an attempt to recapture, retrieve and reinterpret the historical moment of inbetweeness which was subsequently either co-opted by the logic of the art market or simply forgotten and left out from the world map of art history. I argue that in order to reestablish art's political relevance in the age of global disillusionment from art's capacity to have an impact upon other spheres of social activity, it is essential to articulate those spaces which challenge the established notions of political art in the context of Euro-American academic and artistic discourses. This historical project provides a means to unsettle prevailing dominant (Western European and North American) accounts of the avant-garde, histories of modernism and. postmodernism, and the definitions and assumptions attached to these discourses. As well, Armenian contemporary art history points in another direction towards the history of the late Soviet years, from Gorbachev's programs of perestroika and glasnost' (1986) to the collapse of the USSR (1991). In the introductory chapter I introduce the context as well as the goals and relevance of the project both within the academic field of art history and larger political debates related to post-socialist culture. The chapter which follows the introductory chapter examines the artistic context of Armenian contemporary art since the late 1980s within the framework of late Soviet perestroika politics. It focuses on the late Soviet artists' movement in Armenia, the 3rd Floor (1987-1994). In chapter three, entitled ""ACT/ivism: Political Aesthetics of Affirmation"", I attempt to write as well as critically examine the history of the conceptual artists' group ACT. I want to argue that ACT's radical utopian ideal of constructing the new state as a work of pure autonomous creation harbored a potentiality for the formation of participatory politics/aesthetics in post-Soviet Armenia. In the three chapters that follow the historical contextualization of ACT, I analyze the practices of ACT's individual members David Kareyan, Narek Avetissian and Diana Hakobian after the breakdown of the group in 1996. I suggest that the group's collapse signaled the shift from a belief in socially committed art to a return to the enclosed and isolated space for creation.",899752618,,Dissertations & Theses," Harutyunyan, AnzhelaHarutyunyanAnzhelaHarutyunyan, Anzhela", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491276631 , 64939071 , 101309 , U516771 , U516771", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899752618?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," (UMI)AAIU516771 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+ruins+of+utopia%3A+the+political+aesthetics+of+the+armenian+avant-garde&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Harutyunyan%2C+Anzhela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Evaluating the engaged institution: The conceptualizations and discourses of engagement,"Over the past two decades there have been growing public dialogues around the concern that institutions of higher education and the faculty, staff and students within them, are disengaged – separated and unconcerned with issues beyond their immediate environments, both physical and social. A concomitant discourse has emerged in higher education and its associated institutions towards greater engagement: of students with their learning and community service; of faculty and staff with applied research and public scholarship; and of internal groups with external communities. At the broadest level, this concept culminates with the representation that the institution as a whole is engaged as an organizational citizen on a local, regional, national or global level. Engaged higher education is being promoted by a variety of stakeholders each with differing philosophies and accompanying discourses as to the role of higher education as a whole and the expectations of institutions of higher education. As a relatively new term applied to the activities of higher education, engagement is an emerging conception that is presently being constructed and defined by actors within and outside of higher education. As these conceptions are expressed and given form, systems and measures of evaluating the accomplishment of engagement are being developed. The activity and process of evaluation defines measures, refines concepts, directs resources and shapes policy. Evaluation systems and the evaluative measures themselves focus attention on select aspects of the broader issue. Thus, the discourses that are invoked to support the evaluation of engagement and the construction and selection of the measures are simultaneously revealing and setting the boundaries for problem and solution conceptualization. For institutions of higher education to respond to measures of engagement, and/or for outside stakeholders to perceive higher education as engaged, an understanding of the meaning of engagement and the accompanying underlying values and beliefs within these discourse communities is necessary. Analyzing the discourses surrounding engaged higher education evaluation reveals assumptions of validly measurable engaged activity and perceptions of attainment. The analysis also reveals the more influential discourses in the role that higher education “should” be playing within the broader society and the implied successes or failings of higher education in meeting this role, at this point in time, from the perspectives of these engagement evaluation communities. This study examined the discourse(s) within the engagement movement, and in particular two systems – The North Central Association-Higher Learning Commission (NCA:HLC) and The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT) – that address the evaluation of engagement at an institutional level. Using an interpretivist approach toward achieving a meaningful understanding of actor’s frames of reference through the theories and methods of critical discourse analysis, particularly those of Norman Fairclough (1995) and James Paul Gee (1999), the focus was on how an examination of the engagement evaluation discourse communities revealed social and cultural perspectives and assumptions. With a concentration on the evaluative measures, Gee’s (1999) tools of inquiry were assimilated with Bob Barnetson and Marc Cutright’s (2000) typology of the normative assumptions embedded in performance indicators to develop engagement evaluation tools of inquiry. The findings of this study revealed the multi-faceted ways in which the concept of engagement is being constructed and evaluated by different stakeholders at this point in time.",905287849,,Dissertations & Theses," Steel, Victoria A.SteelA.VictoriaSteel, Victoria A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2517230911 , 61705411 , 66569 , 9781267005250 , 3484580 , 3484580", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781267005250, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/905287849?accountid=14496," 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education"," 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education"," 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education",," 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education"," Educational evaluation , Higher education , School administration"," Education , Carnegie Foundation , Engagement , Evaluation measures , Higher Learning Commission",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Evaluating+the+engaged+institution%3A+The+conceptualizations+and+discourses+of+engagement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Steel%2C+Victoria+A.&amp;isbn=9781267005250&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Singularities: Technoculture, transhumanism, and science fiction in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century","A spectre is haunting contemporary technoculture: the spectre of Singularity. Ten years into a century thus far characterized chiefly by the catastrophic failure of global economic and political systems, deepening ecological anxieties, and slow-motion social crisis, the only sector of our collective cultural myth of Progress still vibrantly intact is the technological – a project which, in vivid contrast to the systemic failure that seemingly prevails at nearly every other level, continues to charge forward at breakneck speed. Since the late twentieth century, prompted by the all-but-exponential growth of machine intelligence and global information networks, and by the still largely obscure but increasingly profound-seeming implications of emerging nanotechnology, futurists and fabulists alike have postulated an imminent historical threshold whereupon the nature of human existence will be radically and irrevocably transformed in a sudden explosion of technological development. This moment of transcendence, it is supposed, is at most only a few years off; indeed, some say, it may have already begun. The ""Singularity"" – a term coined in 1986 by the mathematician and science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, and subsequently adopted throughout technocultural discourse – is at present the primary site of interpenetration between technoscientific and science-fictional figurations of the future, an area in which the longstanding binary distinctions between science and SF, and between present and future, are rapidly dissolving. As much as the Singularity thesis implies a total reorganization of society and of the self – which posthumanist cultural studies and cyborg theory have already begun mapping – it also poses a daunting existential challenge to the enterprise of SF itself, to the extent that the Singularity imposes what Vinge has described as ""an opaque wall across the future,"" an impenetrable cognitive obstacle beyond which the extrapolative imagination cannot glimpse. For a genre long defined by its efforts to assert, through the narrative technique of extrapolation, a meaningful continuity between present and future, the Singularity presents a thorny problem indeed, demanding both a reevaluation of SF's conception of and orientation toward the future, and a new narrative model capable of grappling with the alien and often paradoxical complexity of the postsingular. This study is an inquiry into the properties and problematics of Singularity across fictional and nonfictional discourses, and as such it operates on two levels. Reading Singularitarian literature against a broadly articulated context of fringe-science and transhumanist movements, consumer culture, political and economic theory, and related areas of contemporary cyber- and technoculture, I examine how the metaphor of Singularity structures and signifies the aspirations and anxieties of late-twentieth and early twenty-first century technocivilization. As a project of literary criticism specifically, the study works to identify and theorize a grouping of texts that is emerging from cyberpunk and postcyberpunk tendencies in contemporary SF, organized around the premises of Singularity and the posthuman, and classifiable primarily in terms of an attempt to mount a response to the formal and conceptual problems Vinge has identified. Primary readings are drawn from a wide-ranging selection of twentieth- and twenty-first-century technocultural fiction, with emphasis on SF works by Charles Stross, Cory Doctorow, Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker, and William Gibson.",1030148034,,Dissertations & Theses," Raulerson, Joshua ThomasRaulersonThomasJoshuaRaulerson, Joshua Thomas", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2724116531 , 53477441 , 66569 , 9781267462435 , 3516668 , 3516668", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781267462435, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030148034?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0489 Information Technology , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0489 Information Technology , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0489 Information Technology , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0323 American studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0489 Information Technology , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Modern literature , American studies , Canadian literature , Information Technology , American literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Cyberculture , Doctorow, Cory , Gibson, William , Nanotechnology , Postcyberpunk , Posthuman , Rucker, Rudy , Science fiction , Singularity , Stephenson, Neal , Sterling, Bruce , Stross, Charles , Technoculture , Transhumanism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Singularities%3A+Technoculture%2C+transhumanism%2C+and+science+fiction+in+the+21st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Raulerson%2C+Joshua+Thomas&amp;isbn=9781267462435&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Choosing the other: conversion to christianity in japan,"This thesis explores conversion to Christianity in contemporary Japan. Christianity is widely regarded as having failed to make any impact on Japanese culture, and to be a foreign body (indeed in the opinion of some an irritating foreign body) that has failed to accommodate with or indigenise itself in Japan. And yet, Japanese people continue to choose to convert to Christianity. What is the significance of this? Are people who convert those who feel excluded from mainline Japanese society, the proof of which is their affiliation with a foreign religion, or can this phenomenon of conversion be understood in a different way? This thesis suggests that it can be, and that the fact that small but significant numbers of Japanese regularly convert to Christianity means that the understanding of Christianity's place in the Japanese religious landscape needs to be re-examined.Theories of conversion are studied, with a view to identifying the particular approaches to analysing and understanding conversion which will be appropriate for the Japanese context. The work of Rodney Stark and William Bainbridge on conversion to a deviant perspective forms the starting point for the study. Cultural and religious norms of Japan are identified, with a view to investigating in what ways and to what degree Christianity in Japan represents a deviant perspective. The history of Christianity in Japan is studied, indicating that at certain times in Japan's history when there is a feeling of national uncertainty and of a lack of social integration there is an openness to Christianity, although at times of national self-confidence there is more resistance to it. Christianity is also compared and contrasted with Japan's New Religious Movements, which may also represent a deviant perspective. Qualitative research among converts to Christianity is carried out. The results of this research show that while there are parallels between conversion to Christianity and to New Religious Movements there are also areas of difference, especially in terms of motives for conversion. Motives for conversion to Christianity tend to focus on what might be termed 'the spiritual', and conversion is experienced in terms of emotional peace, welcome into a Christian congregation, and the promise of salvation to come, rather than the 'health and wealth' or 'this worldly benefits' which are reckoned to be, or to have been, motives for conversion to New Religious Movements. As Shimazono Susumu points out, however, the so called 'New' New Religions also have a focus on spiritual salvation.The conclusion reached is that, though Japanese who convert to Christianity are choosing 'the other' in that their choice is clearly not to stay within the religious mainstream of the country, yet Japanese society is more heterogeneous than is often assumed and actually embraces a range of diverse groups. Christian converts, while being aware of the tensions which they face as a result of conversion, do not feel 'outsiders' in Japanese society. So, while Christianity cannot be said to have indigenised in the way that Buddhism clearly has, yet it should not be seen as an unsuccessful foreign import, but rather, in terms of glocalisation, as a culturally appropriate local expression of a global movement.",1314564589,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, Ian DavidMillerDavidIanMiller, Ian David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2907796531 , 65085551 , 101309 , U558965 , U558965 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:94040", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314564589?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0318 Religion, Religion," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:94040 , 525648 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Choosing+the+other%3A+conversion+to+christianity+in+japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Ian+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Identifying (with) 'carlota': myths, metaphors and landscapes of cuban africanía, 1974-1980","The thesis expands the field of scholarly enquiry on the Cuban intervention in Angola beyond the frame of geopolitics into the area of cultural politics. It considers the relation between Africa as a cultural and political `territory' in the Cuban imaginary and the epic internationalist mission known as Operation Carlota. By focusing on representations and manifestations of 'Africanness' in discursive practices ranging from culture and the arts to domestic and foreign policy, the enquiry illustrates how the notion of Cuba as Latin-African evolved in relation to changes in revolutionary ideology during the period known as the quinquenio gris, and with regard to the swell of liberation movements throughout the African Diaspora. My approach proceeds from Victor Turner's theory of liminality, which discusses how ritual behaviour and symbolism - rites de passage - may be used as concepts for an understanding of social structure and processes With this view in mind, I construct a theoretical framework that conjoins the notion of ritual in Cuba's Africa derived religious practices with the more general idea of war, or in this case internationalism, as a social ritual. In this way, I demonstrate that the Angolan Experience was essential to the transformation of Cuban collective identity from Latin American to Caribbean by the 1980s. This shift, I claim, was sponsored, on the international level, by the symbolism of the military mission as an epic re-enactment of the West African Diaspora/Caribbean myth of return, and, on the national level, by slave iconology.

This research is an attempt to understand Būdshīshiyya faqīrāt’ s religiosities by looking at the ways in which religious discourses are corporeally endorsed, by exploring the religious body in movement, in performance and in relation to the social order.  Chapter 1 provides an historical introduction to the Order that will help us to better understand the processes by which this local tarīqa from the wilāya of Oujda has become the international organization that it is today.  The chapter also discusses the diverse types of members that constitute the Order.  Chapter 2 explores the religious body in movement by assessing the meanings that religious journeying has for the female devotees of the Būdshīshiyya.  It assesses a variety of aspects involved in the annual visit that followers of SīdīHamza make to the central lodge in Madāgh.  Chapter 3 explores bodily religious enactments in ritual performance, by discussing the central practices of Sufi ritual as enacted by Būdshīshiyya faqīrāt.  Chapter 4 discusses Būdshīshiyya’s diverse identities as they find expression in practices and understandings related to health issues. It discusses miracle performance in relation to shifā’, and also how the tarīqa’ s official discourse has been adapted by followers in European and Moroccan urban milieus in an attempt to accommodate New-Age understandings of body and self.  Finally, chapter 5 analyses discourses and narratives linked with dressing practices as produced by faqīrāt in different locations.  Overall, the study explores the diverse myriad of religiosities existing in the Sufi Order Qādiriyya al-Būdshīshiyya by devoting attention to the ways in which religious life is corporeally manifested.",1439821499,,Dissertations & Theses," Dominguez Diaz, MartaDominguez DiazMartaDominguez Diaz, Marta", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3091494351 , 80740702 , 101309 , U580411 , U580411", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1439821499?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0318 Religion, Religion," (UMI)AAIU580411 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revisiting+moroccan+sufism+and+re-islamisizing+secular+audiences%3A+female+religious+narratives+in+the+tar%C4%ABqa+q%C4%81diriyya+b%C5%ABdsh%C4%ABshiyya+in+morocco+and+western+europe+today&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dominguez+Diaz%2C+Marta&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Danse philosophique!: the social and political dynamics of zouglou music in abidjan, côte d'ivoire, 1990-2008","Zouglou is a popular music style of Cote d'Ivoire that is identified primarily through its outspoken lyrics of social comment and its dance with angular arm movements. It was born into a time of social upheaval in the country in the early 1990s, when students and professors were at the forefront of a movement demanding political pluralism: Today, Zouglou has also become Cote d'Ivoire's internationally most successful music. This thesis provides a detailed history of Zouglou's development from the university residence in Yopougon through the precarious neighbourhoods of Abidjan to its rise in international charts. It argues that the power of Zouglou music is located in a number of factors: as an urban music, Zouglou is not associated with any particular region or ethnic group; it is a supra-ethnic, national music which is of special significance at a time in Ivoirian history where political battles have divided the country into a northern and a southern half. As a new, urban musical form, Zouglou distinguishes itself through its use of Nouchi, the French street-slang spoken in Abidjan, and its use of very direct, outspoken texts, rather than of subtle, coded messages. It is well known that in many African cultures, musical performance is evaluated primarily through the song texts. Based on the idea that the strength of Zouglou music lies in its song texts, this thesis gives detailed analyses of their content. Zouglou's pervasive use of satirical humour has won it many listeners and great acclaim. Thus, Zouglou has in a real sense become street poetry, and its main themes criticise and comment on social problems. Zouglou is also known to criticise the behaviour of the political elite, and thus has gained a reputation as socially and political engaged music. Zouglou musicians have, through their songs, taken the initiative of public debate in the country, and have been considered as speaking in lieu of intellectuals, despite frequently being school drop-outs. In one of Zouglou's first recordings, its dance was described as a dancep hilosophique,a philosophical dance. Despite its intrinsically popular and mediated nature, Zouglou has, through its reflective song texts, remained true to this description, as this thesis demonstrates",1442503867,,Dissertations & Theses," Schumann, AnneSchumannAnneSchumann, Anne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101288871 , 80741192 , 101309 , U597657 , U597657", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442503867?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," (UMI)AAIU597657 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Danse+philosophique%21%3A+the+social+and+political+dynamics+of+zouglou+music+in+abidjan%2C+c%C3%B4te+d%27ivoire%2C+1990-2008&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schumann%2C+Anne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Ways of seeing the seed: &lt;i&gt;Navdanya's&lt;/i&gt; seed &lt;i&gt; satyagraha&lt;/i&gt;,"Since the 1960s, introduction of Green Revolution seeds in India has resulted in erosion of crop diversity and has had catastrophic effects on soil, water and farmers. More than 200,000 farmers have committed suicide since 1997. In 1987, Vandana Shiva started the Navdanya seed savers’ movement with the goal of conserving remaining crop diversity and assisting farmers in retaining seed sovereignty by developing and sustaining village-level seed supply systems and traditional farming practices. Navdanya has co-established fifty-four community seed banks and trained 500,000 farmers in organic farming. Navdanya was also a response to anticipated neo-liberal adjustment programs, the introduction of trade-related intellectual property rights to apply to new plant varieties, and the commercialization of genetically engineered seeds. This thesis examines Navdanya ’s efforts at local, regional, national and international levels to transform both policy and farming. The Gandhian model has been a major inspiration for Navdanya as has the advocacy work and agroecological practices of rural social movements around the world. The thesis investigates Navdanya ’s conviction that the industrial model of agriculture is violent using the Green and Gene Revolutions and farmers’ suicides to test the plausibility of this hypothesis. It analyzes Gandhi’s ethics of nonviolence and his ethics-based economics by starting with a comparative reading of Gandhi and Nehru’s different visions for India. It employs a ‘ways of seeing’ approach to theorize the confrontation around seed as the outcome of context specific historical and cultural perspectives. Research involved field interviews with Indian farmers and staff of Navdanya as well as extensive examination of the organizations’ own studies and reports, analysis of state planning for agricultural development, and review of academic analyses of the impacts and hazards of farming with Green Revolution hybrids and with transgenic varieties as well as the vitality of agroecological traditional farming systems.",1515755415,,Dissertations & Theses," Singh Decosas, Manisha M.Singh DecosasM.ManishaSingh Decosas, Manisha M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3274564751 , 86851942 , 66569 , 9780499231840 , NS23184 , NS23184", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780499231840, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1515755415?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications",," 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," Communication , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Agricultural biodiversity , Grassroots movements , Green revolution , India",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ways+of+seeing+the+seed%3A+Navdanya%27s+seed+%0Asatyagraha&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Singh+Decosas%2C+Manisha+M.&amp;isbn=9780499231840&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Training tastes: A relational approach to food, taste, and the senses.","This thesis explores the ways taste is mobilized as a sensory, cultural, and political force in contemporary Western societies. My explorations derive from a context in which there is a growing dissatisfaction with the quality of food and this is seen as severely impacting upon social and cultural structures and institutions and as altering people’s health, habits and ways of life. This thesis investigates in what way taste and people’s sensuous engagement with food offers insight into the nature of relations between people, food, and environs. It further examines how such relations tackle the transmogrification of food and the systems supporting it, how these surpass dichotomous views of fast and slow food, and how these redefine essential dimensions of what it is that constitutes food and eating. I show that taste, rather than being a static attribute which determines people’s choices and status, is an active process of exploring, learning, and knowing. The analysis of relations between people, food and the senses is grounded in ethnographic research pursued with the Slow Food Movement in Britain. This international organization, originating in Italy, advocates that the education of taste is imperative and people need to develop and deepen their knowledge about food by eating produce which is produced, sourced, sold and prepared in sustainable and equitable ways. The thesis discuses discursive and embodied ways of engaging with food and proposes approaching the formation and training of taste in terms of patterns of perceptual experience. In highlighting food tasting as a sensory practice, I introduce the notion of sensory pageantry and evaluate several tensions and contestations around speedier and slower modalities of experiencing taste. Thus, I demonstrate that training slower modalities of experiencing taste. Thus, I demonstrate that training techniques of remembering, repeating, rebalancing and fine-tuning hone taste into a skill and mode of knowing. This thesis argues that taste is relational and multi-sensuous. Methodologically, this thesis takes an interdisciplinary perspective and draws on arguments, concepts and theories from anthropology and sociology, cultural geography and ecological psychology.",1651897796,,Dissertations & Theses," Bentia, D.

The UK, like other wealthy countries in the global north, has become the recipient of increasing numbers of refugees, many of whom are highly qualified and have professional backgrounds (Kirk 2004; Houghton and Morrice 2008). This thesis captures the experiences of refugees with professional and higher level qualifications as they seek to rebuild their lives in the UK. Rather than look at migration through more traditional lenses of assimilation and acculturation it instead links the experience of refugees with theories and processes of learning and identity formation. This offers a more nuanced and fine grain understanding and analysis of refugee experience. The study is guided by two broad questions: firstly, how might individual biography shape and inform the strategies adopted by refugees in the UK, and secondly, what insight does learning (both informal and formal) offer to our understanding of the processes involved in transition to the UK. To address this I have adopted a longitudinal approach which follows five refugees over a four year period as they move through the asylum system, negotiate a new social space and enter higher education. The narratives presented illuminate the hybridity of experience and indicate how each refugee has his or her own personal story which is linked to their unique biographical, cultural and social background. However, each narrative is lived within the broader social template of what it means to be a refugee in the UK in the first decade of the twenty first century, and how this template is negotiated, managed and sometimes subverted in different ways. These experiences cross cut and intersect with differences of ethnicity, of gender, of country of origin, faith and age. I draw on Bourdieu's framework of capital, field and habitus as tools to apprehend and explore the processes underlying the narratives (1977; 1998; 1999). Becoming a refugee in the UK firmly placed participants into symbolic structures of inequality and disadvantage. They are structured and positioned through mechanisms of capital transformation and trading which mean that they rarely have opportunities to convert and trade up the capitals they possessed into symbolic capital, and educational and employment reward. The narratives presented depict the struggles of refugees to accrue and convert capital in order to claim a positive identity. It is also about the struggle to be recognised as having moral worth, to be respected and seen to be respectable (Skeggs 1997; Sayer 2005). A broad range of learning processes are involved in managing transition. To capture the profundity and complexity of subjective construction and identity formation I suggest conceptualising learning as processes of ‘becoming' and ‘unbecoming'(Biesta 2006; Hodkinson et al. 2007). From the disintegration and deconstruction of self which accompanies migration this research illuminates how participants learn to ‘become', which in its broadest sense is learning how to rethink themselves in order to live with integrity and dignity in a new social space.",1683610043,,Dissertations & Theses," Morrice, Linda MaryMorriceMaryLindaMorrice, Linda Mary", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3697536251 , 96374362 , 101309 , U634815 , U634815 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/2527/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1683610043?accountid=14496, 0340 Educational sociology, 0340 Educational sociology, 0340 Educational sociology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0340 Educational sociology, Educational sociology," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/2527/ , (UMI)AAIU634815 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Managing+the+transition+to+a+new+life%3A+a+longitudinal+study+of+learning+processes+and+identity+%28re%29formation+among+refugees+in+the+uk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morrice%2C+Linda+Mary&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The social construction of risk in child trafficking discourses: a study of melodramatic tactics in child trafficking narratives,"Child trafficking is a term used to define situations where children are forced, coerced or tricked to migrate for the purpose of their future exploitation. The issue of child trafficking is a well established UK policy concern initially emerging in the seventeenth century. The issue re-appeared in the late nineteenth century influenced by the social purity movement. This generated an infamous media exposé which led to parliamentary debates and legislative changes. Child trafficking resurfaced as a UK policy concern periodically in the twentieth century as children were once again forced to migrate. At the start of the twenty-first century child trafficking is back on the UK national policy agenda following pressure exerted by international anti-trafficking networks and Non Government Organisations. This study examines the social construction of risk in current and historical child trafficking UK policy discourses. Interviews with key informants in the ports safeguarding sector are discussed, together with an analysis of policy documents and primary historical sources. The construction of risk in these child trafficking discourses appear in a specific format which is explained by drawing on the conceptual lens of melodramatic tactics. This analysis reveals how narratives of child trafficking tend to have a stereotypical tragic child victim, who is forcibly separated from their family, and in need of protection from dangerous criminals who aim to deceive and exploit them. The employment of these melodramatic tactics is a central feature of current UK child trafficking policy discourses. Research studies which situate migrant children as competent social actors illuminate accounts of triumph, and these contrast with the outrage-driven protest drama which has current and enduring appeal in UK child trafficking policy discourses. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of current UK child trafficking policy and recommendations about future research with children on the move are also proposed.",1683610119,,Dissertations & Theses," Westwood, Joanne L.WestwoodL.JoanneWestwood, Joanne L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3697536751 , 96374612 , 101309 , U634665 , U634665 , http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/3717/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1683610119?accountid=14496," 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy"," 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy"," 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0627 Criminology , 0630 Public policy"," Criminology , Public policy"," http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/3717/ , (UMI)AAIU634665 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+social+construction+of+risk+in+child+trafficking+discourses%3A+a+study+of+melodramatic+tactics+in+child+trafficking+narratives&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westwood%2C+Joanne+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Towards inclusion: influences of culture and internationalisation on personhood, educational access, policy and provision for students with autism in ghana","This research explores the ways in which local knowledge, attitudes and beliefs surrounding disability influence the socially constructed experience of autism in Ghana. It further explores the impact of these beliefs on educational access, policy and provision as well as on inclusion in wider society for both children with autism and their families. It is argued throughout that conceptualisations of both autism and disability are subtly, and at times unconsciously, shaped by cultural influences as well as individual experiences. Using semi-structured interviews, participatory methods and text analysis, this thesis first examines internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for cultural relevancy and concludes that while 'autism'does indeed transcend cultural barriers, its presentation is nonetheless culturally bound. The presentation of each of autism's 'triad of impairments' is explored in Ghana, namely communication and socialisation impairments alongside a restricted range of interests and repetitive behaviour patterns. Significantly, the experience of autism demonstrated in this thesis, at both a personal and familial level, is linked to, and negotiated through, cultural belief systems. A relatively shared 'worldview', understood as the culturally mediated lens through which autism and impairment are understood and managed in Ghanaian society, is outlined. Traditional values, a deep sense of spirituality and communal kinship responsibilities are highlighted. Next, an exploration of causal attributions, valued and de-valued personhood traits and the expected role of an adult in society each highlights significant influences on the perception and management of autism in Ghana. Throughout, this thesis focuses on the impact of autism, as constructed and understood in urban Ghana, on the individual, one's kin and broader society. The second half of this thesis focuses on educational access, policy and provision with particular attention to Ghana's burgeoning inclusive education efforts. Conceptualisations of disability and difference, as negotiated through Ghanaian culture, norms and history are explored alongside the implications of these beliefs in designing educational provision for students with autism as well as the socio-political pressures to adhere to large scale international movements such as Education for All (EFA). In particular, tensions between local and international conceptualisations of 'disability' and 'inclusion' are highlighted and it is concluded that adoption of international declarations into local policy, and subsequently into local practice, needs to be better negotiated alongside culturally relevant systems and beliefs. International declarations, rooted in a social model of disability, are found to clash with local conceptualisations of disability rooted in an often intuitive understanding of disability consistent with an individual model. However, consistency with an individual model did not equate to biomedical understandings of disability, which was instead mediated through a lens of socialrelational causation and management more consistent with religious or cultural models of disability. It is concluded that acknowledging and respecting Ghanaian understandings of disability is a prerequisite to ensuring inclusion of children with autism, both in education and their community.

The creation of a personal profile in MySpace allows a user to connect with a global network of friends and communicate in a number of different ways. This thesis sets out to explore the experience of MySpace in terms of the self, identity and community. MySpace will be studied from a constructionist form of social psychology that benefits from new dialects of movement, performance and process. MySpace is conceptualised as a mediated community where users shape and are shaped by their experience of using the site. This study uses empirical data taken from the natural use of MySpace. A total of 100 open-access profiles are explored for the myriad ways that users constitute the self and identity in MySpace. The analysis identifies a number of functions of mediating the self including: the brand me, the hoped-for self and the self in potential. The brand me describes the reflective ability to realise other normative capacities through the practice of blogging in MySpace. This focuses on the ability to create new forms of subjectivity in MySpace interactions. In a similar vein, the hoped-for self explains the modification of the self through the act of profile changing and focuses on the actual, everyday practices of the self. Each of these analytic themes demonstrates the importance of the relational connections in MySpace. Finally, the self is defined as in potential as the analysis demonstrates an ongoing need for a narrative construction to the profile that is performed in both the visual and the textual aspects of the page.",1779218557,,Dissertations & Theses," Goodings, LewisGoodingsLewisGoodings, Lewis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013131451 , 103728882 , 101309 , U564750 , U564750 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/6337", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779218557?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/6337 , 520355 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+network+sites%3A+a+constructionist+approach+to+self%2C+identity+and+community+in+myspace&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goodings%2C+Lewis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Mindtouch: ephemeral transference: liveness in networked performance with mobile devices,"This practice-based thesis investigates the four key qualities of 'liveness', 'feltness', 'embodiment' and 'presence' in mobile media performance, in order to shed light on the use qualities and sensations that emerge when mobile technologies are used in tandem with wearable devices in performance contexts. The research explores mobile media as a non-verbal and visual communication tool that functions by repurposing the mobile phone device and its connection to a wireless network, not only for communication but explicitly for the expression of 'emotion' in the form of a video file representing an interpersonal connection shared over distance. The research aims to identify and supplement existing scholarly discourse on the nature of these four key strands of kinaesthetic philosophy made 'live' in the online network, applying knowledge gained through the practice of enhancing participant experience of the use of simple ubiquitous mobile tools with bespoke biofeedback sensors and an online repository for the playback of users' visual expressions. This enhanced toolkit enables participants to share personal relationships and social interactions in an immediate way, with collaborators at a distance; The selected methodology of active research using kinaesthetic tools in live performance seeks to identify and clarify new ways of simulating or emulating a non-verbal, visual exchange within a social participatory context, with particular attention paid to a sense of 'feltness' as an element of 'presence' or 'liveness', and with attention to the experience of a sense of 'co-presence' arising in real-time collaborative mobile performances at a distance. To best explore these concepts as well as the bodily sensations involved for participants, the thesis analyses original data gleaned from a larger R&amp;D project (conducted in tandem with this thesis project, sponsored by the BBC) as its major case study. The project, called MINDtouch, created a series of unique practice-based new media performance events played out in real-time networked contexts. The MINDtouch events were framed as a means for participants to simulate dream exchange or telepathic thought transfer using mobile phones and biofeedback devices, linked to a bespoke video file protocol for archiving and sharing visual results. The corporeal, nonverbal forms of communication and visual interaction observed when participants use such devices within participatory performance events is examined by way of demonstrating the impact of specific live encounters and experiences of users in this emerging playing field between real-time and asynchronous, live and technologised forms expressing liveness/presence/distance. The thesis benefits from access to the larger MINDtouch project and its original data, providing this research with a set of process-based evidence files both in video and transcript form (contained in the thesis appendices). By analysing this unique data set and applying the theoretical contexts of kinaesthetic philosophies where appropriate, the thesis demonstrates both the practical and the critical/contextual effectiveness of the media facilitation process for the participants, and shares their senses of 'liveness' and 'presence' (of themselves and of others) when using technology to externalise visual expressions of internalised experiences. This thesis makes an original contribution to scholarship in the fields of Performance and New Media, with additional contributions to the cognate fields of Philosophy and Technology, and locates its arguments at the locus of the fields of Performance Art, Mobile Performance/Locative Media, Philosophies of the Body and Communications. The thesis uses methods, practices and tools from Phenomenology, Ethnography, Practice-As-Research, and Experience Design, bringing together the relevant aspects of these diverging areas of new media research and media art/performance practices. The research demonstrates that there is a need for new technological tools to express viscerally felt emotion and to communicate more directly. It is hoped that this study will be of use to future scholars in the arts and technology, and also that it may help to demonstrate a way of communicating rich emotion through felt and embodied interactions shared with others across vast distances (thus supporting political movements aimed at reducing global travel in the age of global warming).",1779221780,,Dissertations & Theses," Baker, CamilleBakerCamilleBaker, Camille", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013155501 , 103110972 , 101309 , 10061463 , 10061463", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779221780?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10061463 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mindtouch%3A+ephemeral+transference%3A+liveness+in+networked+performance+with+mobile+devices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Baker%2C+Camille&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Sustaining open capital accounts: international norms and domestic institutions: a comparison between peru and colombia,"Financial liberalization programs have been adopted by many countries in Latin America during the past twenty years. Opening the economy to inflows and outflows of capital – ‘opening the capital account’ – has been a key part of these programs. Many economists have heralded capital account liberalization as a ‘fast track’ to economic growth and efficiency in developing countries, partly due to the way that it tightens the constraints on governments and disciplines them to avoid ‘bad’ policies. Others, however, have emphasized the dangers of capital account openness, such as its close relationship with financial crises and the substantial risks it poses for macroeconomic stability. While some governments have sustained the opening of their capital account over decades, others have reversed course after only a short time. The existing literature has focused on the adoption of capital account liberalization, but has neglected to consider the reasons for its durability or fragility. My dissertation addresses the question of why different countries have sustained their opening of the capital account to different degrees and for different periods. The central argument is that the sustainability of capital account openness is determined by domestic informal institutions. By informal institutions I refer to the shared understandings or rules among a country’s policymaking and business elites about legitimate economic policies. Whether capital account openness is sustained over time depends on the extent of domestic agreement as to whether capital controls continue to be effective and legitimate, or whether they have lost their effectiveness and legitimacy as instruments of macroeconomic policymaking. Not only is my dissertation the first study of the sustainability of capital account openness, it is the first to emphasize the importance of informal institutions as distinct from formal ones. The next question refers to the factors that determine the content of domestic informal institutions, such that they favor capital account openness in some countries, and are much more equivocal in others. My answer emphasizes the legacy of pre-liberalization state-business relations. Capital account openness is unlikely to be sustained over time if the export-oriented sector of the economy – concerned about a stable and competitive exchange rate – preserves its leverage over national policymaking. Conversely, capital account openness tends to become a durable policy if economic actors benefitting from capital mobility and largely unaffected by exchange-rate issues dominate state-business relations. After the introduction, Chapter 2 describes the essential elements of capital account policy and explains the methodological approach of the dissertation. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the literature to explain capital account policy. It distinguishes between interest-based, institutionalist, and ideas-based approaches located at different levels of analysis. This review highlights a notable gap in the literature. Analyses of the role of informal institutions at the domestic level are conspicuously lacking. My dissertation seeks to fill this analytical lacuna. Chapter 4 analyzes the international campaign for capital freedom, personified by the International Monetary Fund. How did the push for capital account liberalization come into being at the international level, and how has the capital account policy discourse within the IMF evolved until the present time? Ultimately, the attempt to transform capital freedom into an international norm was not successful. The effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 within and outside the IMF undermined the international norm campaign, symbolized by the failure of the attempt to change the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in order to give the organization the legal mandate over member-states’ capital account policies. However, the IMF still subscribes to the idea that the free movement of capital is a desirable policy for all countries. Yet country responses have been very different. Chapters 5 and 6 examine the link between IMF prescriptions and domestic policy outcomes, fleshing out the central argument with case studies of Peru and Colombia, respectively, in the time period from 1990 to the present day. Both countries shared similar economic challenges, a national community of elite economists convinced of free-market principles, and outside pressure from the IMF. At the start of the liberalization period in the early 1990s, both switched from a largely closed to a largely open capital account. However, due to the effect of different informal institutions based on different state-business relations, Peru and Colombia then followed different paths. The two cases serve to illustrate that, in the broader context of financial liberalization, socially shared understandings about legitimate economic policies reinforce or constrain the impact of international norms, thus making – or breaking – attempts at economic reform. Scholars interested in explaining the sustainability of neoliberal economic reforms and the impact of international norms and ideas on domestic policy choices ignore the role of domestic informal institutions at their peril. Traditional approaches focused on material interests, formal political and economic institutions, and global norms and ideas fail to account for the variation of capital account policy in an age of mobile capital. Paying heed to the change and continuity of shared understandings about legitimate economic policies is key to understanding both the influence of international norms on domestic policy, and the durability or fragility of economic reforms. In order to become institutionalized in the domestic political economy, international norms setting out to diffuse free-market policies must encounter a social context in which alternative development strategies have lost their legitimacy.",1779539259,,Dissertations & Theses," Leiteritz, Ralf J.LeiteritzJ.RalfLeiteritz, Ralf J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015137681 , 102697082 , 101309 , 10089870 , 10089870 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/260/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779539259?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/260/ , (UMI)AAI10089870 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustaining+open+capital+accounts%3A+international+norms+and+domestic+institutions%3A+a+comparison+between+peru+and+colombia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leiteritz%2C+Ralf+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Company culture: information, scholarship, and the east india company settlements 1660-1720s","I explore how knowledge was created and circulated in and between the settlements of the early English East India Company. I aim: to demonstrate connections between scholarship and early colonialism; to highlight the role of non-elite actors in transferring skills and techniques; and to map global knowledge networks based on systems of patronage that cut across national, ethnic, and social boundaries. Chapter 1 uses the life of Samuel Baron, a half-Dutch, half-Vietnamese factor, spy, and broker for the EIC, client of the rulers of Siam and Tonkin, and author of the Description of Tonqueen to examine the importance of passeurs culturels or go-betweens to both the European trading companies and Asian rulers in the period and their role in transmitting geographical and ethnographic information. Chapter 2 examines the local and international botanical and medical networks of two Company surgeons in Madras, based on collections in the Natural History Museum and the surgeons' correspondence with the apothecary James Petiver. Chapter 3 looks in detail at the development of English scholarship on the Malay language: moving from wordlists and manuscript grammars to the first bilingual English-Malay dictionary, published in 1701. I use the texts to examine the early Company's policies of language-learning and teaching and the theoretical and practical basis of linguistic projects in the period. Chapter 4 follows the movement of a travel text, Robert Knox's Historical Relation of Ceylon, with its author on a series of later voyages. I explore the practical uses of such texts to inform bio-prospecting and the transplantation of crops in the Company's search for island bases in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

On the home front, widespread changes to patterns of personal mobility were unfolding in a newly prosperous national climate. The roadside motel and related services, such as the diner and trailer park, offer a fascinating microcosm for the shaping of geographical, political and social identities in the Cold War period, containing, as they did, both the taboo and the culturally mainstream.  In a culture predicated on and continually obsessed with movement, the motel in particular is an interesting, and under-discussed, anomaly: a stationary space designed to offer at once the feeling of the freedom (and anonymity) of travel and the illusion of domestic comfort as the 'home on the road'. Thus in this conceptually and physically liminal space, tensions over gender, class, racial and sexual identity were contested, reimagined and even remade. Applying literary, cultural and spatial analysis to a cross section of under- or un-discussed primary materials, ranging from memoirs of motel management, children's stories and travel guides for African-Americans to pulp fiction, literary novels and films, the project considers how the experience of the actual roadside environment at an individual level has translated into cultural representations of the same space, and argues that the motel captured the pleasures, anxieties and tensions inherent in travel and lodging during a time in which auto-culture was reshaping conceptions of both the built environment and social relations.",1800137915,,Dissertations & Theses," Rodway, CaraRodwayCaraRodway, Cara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

China is one of the largest consumers of petroleum. As the economic developing in China, the gap between the petroleum's demand and supply will become larger and larger and the fluctuations in international petroleum prices will impact on China's economy more and more serious. As a result, it is quite necessary to analyze the impact of fluctuations in petroleum prices on China's market in all areas. This article explores the impact of the volatility in petroleum prices on China's rapeseed market. Rapeseed contains rich oil, each producing about 35% ~ 45% oil. It is the main oil crops and one of the bee crops in China, so three will be great economic significance and social benefits in the development of oilseed rape production. Some articles reveal that the prices of the chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other agricultural have great impact on the petroleum prices. Lin Weilong mentioned if the price of crude oil rises 5%, the costs of agricultural industry will go up with 1%; if the price of crude oil rises 10%, the costs of agricultural industry will go up with 2% ;if the price of crude oil rises 20%, the costs of agricultural industry will go up with 4% in his article. The purpose of this article is to analyze at the background of the fluctuations in petroleum prices, what's the impact of the agricultural corresponding input costs' change on the rapeseed and related changes in agricultural products. This article brings in the trend of the petroleum prices to derive the movement trends in the rapeseed and other agricultural products market. The datas of the World Energy Outlook 2008 from EIA show that,from 2008 to 2017 low petroleum prices forecast will be decreased at an annual average of 3.86%,and high petroleum prices forecast will be rose at an annual average of 5.97%. In the context of low-priced petroleum forcast, rapeseed and rapeseed oil prices were an average annual decline in the proportion of 2.3% and 4%. In addition, the cultivated area of rapeseed will be changed to some extent which will be downward trend.It is expected to fall below 8 million hectares in 2010, and 7.015 million hectares in 2017. From 2007, the cultivation will decrease at an annual average of 1.8%; The yield of rapeseed will increase at an annual average of 2.33%; The production of rapeseed oil will increase year by year, to reach about 5.6 million tons in 2017; China's per capita consumption of rapeseed oil will increase from 3.2 kilograms in 2006 to 3.7 kilograms in 2017.In the context of high-priced petroleum forcast, the price of rapeseed,wheat and other crop prices will rise at an annual average of 4.9%; The cultivated area of rapeseed will increase at the proportion of 0.2% per year. This shows that the price of agricultural products is significant to acreage of farmers. In the context of low-priced petroleum forcast,the Acreage of wheat and rice will not change too much in recent years. In 10 years, the planting area of rice will drop 0.56 percent, and wheat acreage will decline by 9.4%.The yield of rice is mainly between 6.24 tons/ha and 6.25 tons/ha.The yield of wheat will increase a certain percentage from 2006's 4.28 tons / ha to 2017's 5.19 tons / ha,up to 21.26 percent ratio.Net imports of the two crops are continuously reduced, mainly due to foreign price keeping upward trend.Between 2006 to 2017, the annual per capita demand of rice dropped by 10.45 percent, and the annual per capita demand of wheat dropped by 1.54%,in the case of food demand.

Meanwhile, the Chinese immigrants, who served as an important carrier of the character, were also a significant bond amidst China, the Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelagos.Analyzing the relation between Chinese immigrants and ancient Japanese scepter through literature and characters will be beneficial to understanding the impact given by Chinese immigrants in the development of ancient Japanese scepter, as well as the function and role exercised by Chinese immigrants in the formation of the Ancient East Asian International society. Though there have been many studies on Chinese immigrants in Japan, no researches on the relationship between immigrants and the ancient Japanese scepter. From interdisciplinary history, this article has researched ancient Japanese character and literature, described the formation ancient Japanese scepter, the changes of social status of ancient mainland immigrants in the formation of ancient Japanese nation and ancient Japanese scepter development. Based on ancient Chinese and Japanese historical records, archaeological material evidence, this article has discussed Chinese immigrants' contributions to the formation of ancient Japanese character and literature, and their relationship with the formation of ancient Japanese scepter. This article contains six chapters. The preface summarizes the precedent studies and points, and clarifies the research methods and objectives. In the second chapter, which possesses the Japanese archipelagos as a clue, focuses on the ancient Chinese immigrants, our ancestors - ""the first Chinese immigrants"" who used characters but influenced in the external aspect to assist royalty to accept foreign characters, as well as their entry into the Japanese archipelago where they worked as the auxiliaries during the process of original royal foundation and control and the communication with ancient Chinese feudal dynasties. In the third chapter having the Japanese archipelago's turning point and development of characters' appearance as the clue, discusses the negotiations between the Korean Peninsula and China, pointing out that the ancient Chinese immigrants at that time became rare human resources so that by the ancient Japanese royalty would like to compete by force. Furthermore, thanks to the effective use of mainland immigrants, ancient Japan made considerable progress in home and abroad. In the meantime, with the help of Chinese immigrants the Japanese archipelago also produced the original characters. During this process, the islands gradually became unified; original throne transited to the central power, and eventually formed the ruling system with ancient Japanese royalty as its core. In the fourth chapter, keeping mysterious Nanbolu Song's set-up and change as the track, discusses the change of the mode which ancient Japanese throne made use of Chinese immigrants. The change reflects the independence of ancient Japanese imperial power has been strengthened while the freedom of the ancient Chinese immigrants receded. With the change of ancient Japanese rulers towards the political philosophy, Chinese characters and literature were begun to be exploited by Japanese government. However, all these became the tool with which Japanese throne advocated their ruling over their own nation and three sovereign States in North Korea. In the fifth chapter, based on the detailed research that ""Manyoshu"" is the work dependent on Chinese immigrants, with the clue of the features of the ancient verse and the so-called ""Old Song Movement"" revolving around Chinese immigrants, elaborates that they were pushed aside by native Japanese clans and strayed away from the ancient Japanese crown. Although Chinese immigrants desired to seek certain help, the strength and power were not strong as before, as they have lost their language and literature ability, even the advantages of technical production at that time. They arrived a failure even though they had tried. As Japan entered into peaceful period, Chinese immigrants, who once created numerous brilliance in Japanese history, eventually disappeared. The final chapter concludes the relations between Chinese immigrants and the ancient Japanese crown on the basis of literature and characters, indicating the far-reaching significance of the mainland immigration and the related characters and literature, the relationship between Chinese immigrants and the ancient Japanese scepter, in ancient Japanese",1868349285,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, KaiWangKaiWang, Kai", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313760541 , 111084472 , 189128 , 10373508 , 10373508", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868349285?accountid=14496, 0506 World History, 0506 World History, 0506 World History,, 0506 World History, World History," (UMI)AAI10373508 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+the+relations+between+the+mainland+immigrants+and+the+ancient+japanese+crown--from+the+perspective+of+the+character+and+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Kai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on the copyright proper use system under interest balance concept,"Translation from original language as provided by author The copyright fair use system is a distinctive system in copyright legal system. It puts its effort on protecting the interest of copyright holder and it limits some rights of copyright holder to some extent at the same time in order to guarantee the necessary contact to the works between the user of works and the public as well as to reduce the obstruction to the social civilization spreading caused by the copyright holder's monopoly to the works. Since its appearing, scholars and justice practitioners from all over the world have never stopped their study on it and got lots of researching achievements. Even though, their ideas are different, they still get an agreement on the interest balance attribute of fair use. In the paper, the writer tries to analyze the relation between fair use system and interest balance in the angle of jurisprudence and to make a proposal on the legislative modification to perfect the fair use system on the basis of interest balance. The essay is divided into three chapters. Chapter one observes the historical track of the fair use system through the process of its germination, birth and development. The chapter is divided into three short sections. The first section mainly introduces the developing process from the fair use system's germination to its being established as a system in copyright law and then systematizes and internationalizes. In section two, it discusses various kinds of concepts on fair use system in the way of comparison and analysis. At last, it concludes the concept of fair use from a relatively general angle. It innovatively concludes and summarizes on the basic principles of fair use system and deeply elaborates the legal spirits of justice, integrity and interest balance containing in fair use system. In section three, it mainly introduces the current theoretical research state and legislation movement of fair use system in and out China and the rules to it in the international treaties. In chapter two, it analyses the interest balance effect of fair use system in the point of jurisprudence. The chapter is divided into four sections. In the first section, it starts with the analysis to the concepts of interest and interest balance and then analyses the necessity of interest balance effect and finally makes a deep analysis to the interest balance in copyright law. It discusses the copyright law's intention and interest formation and also the connotation of interest balance. In section two, it deeply discusses the interest balance effect of fair use system. First, it analyses and discusses the nature of fair use system and shows that the author agrees to the point of "" user right theory"" and what it rests on. Second, it proves the interest balance effect of fair use system in three aspects. In section three, it analyses the interest balance system of fair use system and the functioning process of balance system as well as its final goal and standard from the point of legal right and obligation. In section four, it mainly discusses the standard to achieve of fair use interest balance effect. In chapter three, it analyses the success and disadvantage on interest balance effect from the point of domestic copyright law's fair use system and then it gives some advice on how to modify and perfect it on this basis. Chapter three is the soul and innovation part of the essay. It is divided into two sections. In section one, it sums up six existing problems and their causes from the point of current legal rules to copyright fair use system in China. In section two, it discusses the problems mentioned and proposes its own assumption and modifying suggestion.

Their ideological and political quality, to some extent, determines the future political developing direction of the party and state, the success or failure of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the realization for the socialism common ideal and communism lofty ideal. As investigations show, the number of university student communists is dramatically increasing in recent years. The education of the communists, however, lags behind. Furthermore, the status quo of their ideological and political quality is not optimistic. In this case, this essay systematically analyzes the ideological and political quality of university student communists is urgent from the aspects of the theory and current situation. First, this essay attempts to define the basic requirements of university student communists the ideological and political quality of the communists from the party building theories of classical Marxian theorists, the party constitution, and the relative documents of the party, and analyze the outstanding aspects on the ideological and political quality of university student communists according to their own characteristics. The aforementioned serves the theoretical basis and study prerequisite of this essay. Second, this essay analyzes the state quo of university student communists' ideological and political quality, and focuses on the existing problems. These problems mainly occur due to the following phenomena: the ideal and belief are not resolute; the motive of joining the party is not pure; the understanding of party building theory is not profound; the party discipline is not rigorous; the modeling effect is not obvious; the awareness of objectives is not intense. These causes are the starting point and actual basis of this essay. Next,this essay analyzes the subjective causes and objective causes of the existing problems among the status quo of university student communists. Subjective causes include: the negative factors among psychological characteristics of university student communists during their adolescence; the modern characteristics of university student communists; the career choices and employment pressures university student communists are faced with. Objective causes include: Due to some failure of social causes, the international communist movement is at low tide; western peaceful evolutions are targeted at university students; the negative effects result from the deep development of the market-oriented economy; the corruption within the party occurs continually, and the party members and cadres can not set an good example with their own action; assessment system of joining the party for university students is not reasonable; communist organization activities for university students are often with a low quality etc. This is the essential study point and theoretically creative point of this essay. Last, this essay proposes correspondent strategies against the existing problems among the state quo. For instance, the evaluation of joining the party for university students should be more rigorous, and the ideological and political quality of applicants for party membership and probationary party member should be greatly improved; diversified and colorful activities are held to study Marxism theories among university student communists; university student communists are organized to practice themselves in a harsh environment regularly; the organization activities of the party are regularly organized, such as the activity for evaluating communists democratically on schedule.

They constantly raised the journal price to grab high profits, causing that the library could not afford the increasingly rising expenditures, which led to the ""Serial Crisis"". In order to regain the control on the Journal's market monopolize by business publishers, coupled with the the opportunities brought by the development of Internet technology,some European and American scientific and technological workers and open supporters hit the ""return science and technology publication to scholars"" slogan, for which purpose they then launched an open access movement. Open Access advocates that academic information can disseminate free without impediment and any person can obtain various types of literature timely, free and without any restrictions through the network to obtain various types of literature. The realization of open access journals mainly relies on two means: open access storage and open access journals. Open access journals is greatly different from open access storage in that it adopts a more stringent quality control program. Therefore, the paper studys systematically and deeply on how to realize the quality control of open access with the open access journals as the main object of study. This paper uses such research methods as literature research and case studies, combining quantitative and qualitative research. The paper mainly focuses on the following aspects: (1) the definition of open access and the way to realize it; analyzing the mode of operation and main types of open access journals. (2) the paper describes the development status of domestic and international open access journals and makes a dialectical analysis of the doubt of people on and the quality status of open access journals. Through a comparative analysis of traditional academic journals and open access journals, the paper holds that the quality control of open access journals mainly includes contents quality control, metadata quality control and dissemination quality control. (3) As far as the content quality control, the paper elaborates the principles and the adoption strategy of it. The paper focuses on the improvement and development of the peer review system and introduces the Online Submission and review system adopted by the open access journals through case study. (4) In the part of meta-data quality control, this article analyzes the importance of meta-data quality control for open access journals as well as its several principles. It also introduces the internationally accepted metadata standards, such as the DC Metadata and the OAI Metadata Harvesting protocol to explore the frequently met problems and the solutions to them of the metadata quality. (5) As far as the dissemination quality control, the paper analyzes the importance of the dissemination quality control and the main elements of it. It highlights the long-term preservation mechanism and link mechanism of the open access journals.

The opinion of protectionism held on that humanity took over the nature,nature was only looked as the methods and the tools for the human motive ;But the theory of conservationism insisted on the nature own immanent value which not relying on the humanity and was for itself, the protection of the nature was not the humanity but the nature. In Leopold's early period, he supported the opinion of protectionism, but with the deepening practicing and promotion of the thought, he got to know limitation of protectionism, in the late period he converted to the opinion of conservationism. A Sand Country Almanac is the crystallization of Leopold's experience, observation and reflection in his whole life. The natural views, especially the thinking of Land ethic is the first moral ethic theory in eastern literatures, which try to establish a complete system including the whole nature of the earth. The ethic theory is that looked the nature of the earth as a whole and put it into the moral view. In this thesis, the first part introduced the Leopold's life, the primary content, the publishing process of the book and Leopold's cognitive process about natural conception. From that we can find the changing process of his thinking. His conversation changed slowly and thoroughly. The second part, we assayed the background of the communication about the changing of his thinking. We also assayed the communication process in the world and in China. Pointed out the reasons why his natural conception was hard to be accepted by social. Leopold devoted himself for the human perennial benefits. In this period, he redefined the relationship of the humanity and the nature, and called for the harmonious development of them. His conversation not only contributed to the development of world environmental movement since the sixties of the 20th century, but also influenced the environmental protection movements from all parts of the world indirectly. Studying the natural conception from A Sand Country Almanac wrote by Leopold in communication view can supply a new view to look and solve the problems in the process of communication.

When some emergency events or disaster incidents occur there, emergency evacuation is essential for groups. The study for crowd emergency evacuation is of great practical significance and helpful for social security. Crowd emergeny evacuation is the basic of building design and emergency rescue, and therefore has been the hot spot for the domestic and international researchers. Many experts have done a lot of research for the crowd emergency evacuation in the building for many years, especially for the crowd movement and the crowd's behavior badsed on quantitative simulation methods. The exiting research was made based on the special behavior survey and statistics, and the research methods can fall into two categories: one is to make evacuation experiment in the real scenario by some animals or people, and the other is to make a mathematical model or to do crowd evacuation simulation by computer. Considering the cost of ethical and moral factors of the evacuation experiments by animals or people, we can know that a mathematical model based on the optimization theory will become an important method for the study on crowd emergency evacuation. Based on the optimization theory, we explore the crowd flow mechanism in crowd evacuation, study overall evacuation time, and study the evacuation decision problem for different exits. Discussion on the relations between evacuation velocity and crowd density is presented in detail by making an optimization evacuation model. Given a certain evacuation scenario, calculating the evacuation time and making the allocation for each exit based on the optimization evacuation model and simulations by the evacuation software buildingEXODUS(v4.06) can be obtained as well as the comparative analysis for the two results.

Warren and several other ecofeminist critics, this thesis analyzes Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale from an ecofeminist point of view. Margaret Atwood is the most famous contemporary Canadian writer. Her unique point of view of a female writer, incisive style, and accurate descriptions win her international reputation. Most of her novels take female characters as protagonists, aiming at revealing the particular problems that women face and reflecting universal social problems. The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1986. Taking females as the leading characters, and environmental crisis as its background, it depicts people who are suffering from tragic environmental pollution in a totalitarian country, in which females are taken as scapegoats of men for environmental problems and are exploited and oppressed. Ecofeminism is a combination of both feminism and environmental protection movements. Born in the 1960s, ecofeminism aims at solving the increasingly severer environmental problems by connecting nature with feminism. It inherits feminist theories, respecting the difference between two genders, encouraging diversity and criticizing dualism and the antagonism between males and females, culture and nature, sense and sensibility; at the same time, it adopts the basic ideas of ecology, such as liberation, opposing oppression, and the pursuit of harmony. Based on these two theories ecofeminism takes establishing s female culture as one of the fundamental solutions to environmental problems. Ecofeminist criticism attacks dualism and patriarchy, doing literature research from the perspective of both environment and gender, calling upon the elimination of dualism ideology and the care of nature and women, so as to develop harmony between nature and human beings, males and females. The Handmaid's Tale is a paradigm of explaining eco-feminist ideas. On the basis of the patriarchal ideology, Gilead is built into a totalitarian country which features taming and ruling females. Females are forced into a submissive position, which makes the whole society fall into abnormality; at the same time, due to the ignorance of the nurture of nature, and the hubris in science development, people trap themselves into doom. In the novel, natural phenomenon and natural creatures are the incarnation of females; and the products of civilization such as guns, cars and books are the incarnation of males. Females, natural phenomena, and natural creatures show resemblance under the same oppression. Females hope to find harmony, equality, wholeness and mutual benefit by getting close to nature, which indicates the closeness between women and nature, as well as nature's healing power upon women. In contrast, men pay much attention to the strength and power that technology and civilization bring to them, and focus on increasing their ability in competition and rivalry. Through revealing the antagonism between nature and civilization, females and males, this thesis points out that the ideology of dualism is the chief reason for Gilead's falling into crisis: on one hand, human beings' self-centeredness and blindly exploitation of nature breed the technique abuse which causes the sterility of nature; on the other hand, the sterility of society comes from women's exclusion from men and men's hostility towards women. Besides, the depiction of female friendship and the thought-provoking ending of the novel indicate that although Gilead is horrible, the female friendship and the closeness to nature have pointed out ways out of the control of patriarchal and dualistic ideas. The Handmaid's Tale reflects eco-feminist ideas that women and nature, which enjoy the same joy and moan the same sorrow, are closely linked together. It also points out that dualism and patriarchy are harmful to both nature and society, which are the root of misery. The novel warns readers of existing antagonism between nature and human beings, females and males and informs people of the value of current achievements of",1868774015,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Hong BoLiuBoHongLiu, Hong Bo", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314442751 , 111116632 , 189128 , 10357564 , 10357564", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868774015?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," (UMI)AAI10357564 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+ecofeminist+analysis+of+the+handmaid%27s+tale&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Hong+Bo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The study on wei yuan's science and technology thoughts,"Translation from original language as provided by author There was extensive research on Wei Yuan, however, few involved in Wei Yuan's Science and Technology Thoughts: In the ""Wei Yuan's 200th anniversary commemoration of the International Symposium"" have been academic exchange and discussion on Wei's business Science and Technology Thoughts; Secondly, what is worth mentioning is the thesis published by the Changsha National Defense University professor Zhu Yazong, "" The expansion and limitations of "" The Practice based on Confucian "" - Review on the values of Wei Yuan's Science and Technology"", But the writer did not very thoroughly and meticulously analysis and demonstrate on the values of Wei Yuan's Science and Technology based on more objective.

Many social, biological and technical systems, such as the spread of infectious diseases, computer viruses, rumor and so on, all can be descript by complex network.. In which, the vertices represent individuals and links mimic the interactions among them. The development of the complex network theory has do some help to the realization of the infectious disease outbreak, and it is a new trend to study the infectious disease in complex network. This paper aims to the study of the SEIQ model in complex networks, and the main contents and originalities in it can be summarized as follows: 1. Introduce the eclipse and quarantine states, the SEIQ model are established and analyzed in the small-world networks and scale-free network respectively. Depending on the spread of disease mechanisms and the mean-field theory, a standard SEIQ model and a L-SEIQ model with the Long-distance Infected are established and simulated in computer with matlab, analyzing it can be find that the probability of eclipse's infected and the Long-distance Infected all have an important influence on the spread of disease. 2. In order to control the spread of the disease, different immunization strategies were used on different network topologies: For the small-world networks, the uniform immunization strategy is taken; for scale-free network, proportional immunization and targeted immunization are considered respectively. Then simulate it and analyze the effectiveness of different strategy; at the same time, the influence of quarantine rate on the spread of disease is considered to provide guidance for the better control of disease spread. 3. The spread of the disease model is applied to the spread of SARS virus, translate the actual data of SARS virus which is transmission in 2003 into the specific parameters of the model, and simulate its spread basing on the previous model, then come to the best strategy for controlling the spread of SARS virus. In short, basing on previous studies, taking the benefits of that the complex networks can simulate the contact relationship between the individual, and combining the characteristics of the spread of disease, the complex network model of the spread of diseases SEIQ is established. Then, immunization strategy and the factors which affect the spread of the disease are analyzed. The empirical analysis is done with the SARS, and the strategy of SARS control is abstained. To a certain extent, the result of this paper enriched the theory of the spread of disease, and the model also has obvious advantages: the newly introduced state describes the spread of the disease process vividly; the way of disease spread can be simulated better in complex networks; the considering of the long-distance infection depicts the mechanisms of disease spread more",1868789725,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, Jia HuaZhouHuaJiaZhou, Jia Hua", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314584941 , 111111532 , 189128 , 10378993 , 10378993", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868789725?accountid=14496, 0364 Applied Mathematics, 0364 Applied Mathematics, 0364 Applied Mathematics,, 0364 Applied Mathematics, Applied Mathematics," (UMI)AAI10378993 , Applied sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+analyze+of+seiq+model+in+complex+network&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Jia+Hua&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The scientific development ideas of the chinese communist party in the 1990s of the 20st century,"Translation from original language as provided by author In the 90s, the CCP's outlook of scientific development encompasses Deng Xiaoping's theory and its enhancement by our country's third-generation leaders' group. The first-generation leaders' group headed by Mao Zedong has made instructive exploration on the progress of socialism which formed a solid foundation for the CCP's outlook on scientific development both in theory and practice. The international socialist movement and the development of foreign capitalism have provided both beneficial experience and lessons for us resulting in the party's idea of development in the 90s. Scientific development constitutes the essence and core of the idea. The 90's outlook answers the three elementary questions of why we should develop, where the power of development locates and the goal of development. During the prolong reform of China, Deng Xiaoping put forward a series of opinions about the problems of development. These opinions were passed on to the third-generation leader's group headed by Jiang Zemin. The success of the 90's economic development was rooted from their insisting and implementing such outlook of development.The 90's development strategy of our party was a detailed demonstration of the idea on scientific development. Den Xiaoping's strategic theory of development dealt with the goal of development, the path for development and the sustaining and comprehensiveness of development. The third-generation leaders' group centered by Jang Zemin further enhanced and implemented the outlook on scientific development primarily by way of reforming economy, implementing the strategy of sustaining development, pushing forward the country's administration under law enforcement and political civilization, enhancing the country's comprehensive strength by developing education and science. The national economy's health and steady growth was greatly propelled with these measures taken.The 90's idea on development is of great significance. First and foremost, it is the inheritance and innovation of the Marxism. Secondly, it provides theoretical guidance for the China-featured socialist construction. In addition, it endows the fourth-generation leaders' group with theoretical basis. Though the 90's idea on development has proved a great success in leading China's socialist practice, it caused several social problems signifying the limit of the party's idea on development. In the 90s, the party's adhering to the socialist direction of development is the fundamental source for the success of China's socialist",1868796848,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, Zhu QingChenQingZhuChen, Zhu Qing", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314548711 , 70613842 , 189128 , 10361547 , 10361547", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868796848?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10361547 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+scientific+development+ideas+of+the+chinese+communist+party+in+the+1990s+of+the+20st+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Zhu+Qing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rural community governance mechanism construction research based on the conservation steward program in z village,"Translation from original language as provided by author Under the general trend of global modernization, China's society enters into a fast transition period, the society presents some breaks and confusions in the tradition to the modern switching process. To guarantee the society having a benignity movement and coordinated development, the state proposed constructing a harmonious society. The community is the microscopic society, the community construction is the foundation engineer of the society constructing, and from our country's national condition, the rural community construction become a key part. Governance construction in rural community is the most important part in rural community, but now the construction in our rural community do not have complete policy system and pattern, it is necessary to do deep research of some rural development exploration practices, to extract useful experiences and common theories that can be promoted. Although the rural environment resources government is only a part of the community governs, but has become a hot spot in the new rural reconstruction, the modern rural community environment resources government can be used as a breakthrough point to research the entire modern rural community governance. In this paper, the basic theory is rural sociology, takes ""Conservation Steward Program"" as a case to do a exploratory action research, analyzes the program's influence and the enlightenment to the governance mechanism of the rural community, refines the authority, the organization, the system, the democracy, the culture are essential factors of the modern rural community governance construction. There are altogether six parts in the paper. The first part, makes a summary of the related research about ""the rural community governance mechanism construction in the transition period"" , then explains and defines two basic concepts of ""the rural community"" and ""the governance mechanism"". The second part, from marketization, modernization, communization three dimensions introduce modern rural community's reforming background. The third part, from the government main body, the government way, the government ability, the government function four dimensions analysis the difficult position that the rural community governance mechanism facing at the present. The fourth part, does a research of the ""Conservation Steward Program"" in Z village, discusses it's influence and enlightenment to the modern rural community governance mechanism construction. The fifth part, base on the preamble theory and practice research, refines the essential factor which the mechanism construction needs. The sixth part, makes a brief summary and the forecast to this research. The paper's innovation spot is the research perspective, noting the civil community-based environmental projects actually come down to the community governance, including government authority, government main body, government principle, government system and so on, that is the governance mechanisms in rural community. This paper also take a ""transition period"" research perspective, it is the social context of the rapid modernization of our country's transformation make the"" New Rural Community Construction"" turn into an urgent cause , and rural community governance is the key to the success of this undertaking, concerns the rural development and stability.

The ethical trade movements urging businesses to pay more attention to the sustainable development of economy, society and natural environment, have aroused wide concern in global community. Although ethical trade gains rapid growth in terms of people's interest in it and its practice development, there are still some problems impeding its future development. Information asymmetry is one of these major issues. In essence, ethical trade is an information-intensive activity based on the free market. It exerts self-regulation and intervenes in the market through the interaction of stakeholders' decision-making; hence information is a most important element in the critical areas of ethical trade. What's more, from the perspective of Management Information System Theory, ethical trade contains an information system which plays regulating, controlling and reference for decision-making functions. Having complete information is not only an essential condition for traders' adequate decision-making, but also premise for the smooth development of ethical trade. However, due to various reasons, including imperfect market mechanisms, high transaction costs, people's limited knowledge and specialty of ethical products, there does exist some degree of information asymmetry between different stakeholders. The problem also triggers a series of issues that are embodied in the production, purchasing and consumption processes. Since the problem of information asymmetry damages the efficiency and effectiveness of ethical trade, it is necessary to improve the information system to promote the transmission and exchange of information in the whole process of ethical trade. To simplify the research, this paper mainly focuses on two core stakeholders --- the enterprises in developing countries and consumers in developed countries and introduces the mathematical model and the game matrix to further analyze the factors that influence the enterprises' decision-making in ethical trade under the condition of asymmetric information. In the end, we try to propose some measures in order to alleviate the degree of information asymmetry",1869047998,,Dissertations & Theses," Yan, YingYanYingYan, Ying", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314856841 , 111097572 , 189128 , 10338694 , 10338694", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869047998?accountid=14496, 0505 Economics, 0505 Economics, 0505 Economics,, 0505 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAI10338694 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+the+information+asymmetry+issue+in+ethical+trade+and+countermeasures&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yan%2C+Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The idea of world revolution of china in mao era,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since 1840, China has gradually been incorporated into the Western capitalist world system. Chinese revolution is no longer an isolated domestic incident, but closely been linked to the development trend, the right pattern and the benefits distribution of the whole world. Rooted in traditional political ideology and culture soil of China, the idea of world revolution of China in Mao era is not only derived from ""At the Same Revolution Theory"" of Max an Engels but also deeply been impacted by the Soviet Union and the Comintern. It has undergone a process from the formation and development to radical evolution and gradual adjustment. Chinese Communist Party is a branch of the Comintern from its birth. After the founding of new China, Chinese communists clarified: Chinese revolution is the part of world revolution of the proletarian socialist. They accepted the analysis about imperialism and national question posed by Max and Engels. And they judged the world situation scientifically, that is ""the revolution and the war"" is the theme of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolutionary. In the two camps of capitalism and socialism, the America not only blockaded and sieged socialist countries but also interfered and suppressed other countries' revolution. So it is the key enemy of world people. On the contrary, the Soviet Union recognized the new China and assisted Chinese revolution enthusiastically. The Soviet Union is the staunch supporter and ally of China. After the successful revolution, China began to pay attention to and support revolutionary movements of neighboring countries. The most obvious manifestation of this is the Korean War and Vietnam War against France. In Mao' opinion ""that is our internationalist duty"". After the min-50', the world balance of power has changed a lot. The strength of Socialism accounted for the overwhelming superiority of the strength of imperialism. In such situation, Soviet Communist Party held the twentieth national congress, proposed the concept of peaceful evolution and détente with the United States vigorously. These practices led to differences between the two parties of Sino-Soviet. In the end revolutionism conquered over peaceful evolution. Chinese believes that the Soviet Union has become the de facto social imperialism and it can not continue to lead international communist movement. As a result, the center of world revolution had in fact transferred to China. In this period, China intensified the concept of world revolution. China believes that the war will occur, so it support for world revolution generously. The strategy that make other countries stop the war through revolution become China' leading foreign policy. As the international situation changes, China has begun to amend the idea of ""world revolution"" in the 70s.Chines leaders have adjusted the goal of world revolution, not stressed whether it is socialism or not, but stressed freedom from imperialist control and fighting for true national independence and liberation. Further more, they proposed the ""three worlds"" theory. China continued to implement world revolution, but they paid more attention to national interests. The most obvious manifestation is to improve relations with the United States. In Mao era, the ideal of world revolution and the national interest has in the confluence of contradictions. However, in most cases, both are equally important and uniformed. The idea of world revolution influences Chinese policy makes on the basic decision about national interest. But it serves the interests of the country ultimately. Although the idea of world revolution in Mao Era has undeniable limitations, it also produced some positive impact for Chinese diplomacy.

The development of abstract art in Shanghai is related to Shanghai's specific geographic location, urban culture, thinking mode and flavor of life: history of leased territory made it tolerating western culture rather than sticking to Chinese tradition; economic prosperity and metropolitan life formed fine and delicate life habits, sensitivity to details and comprehension to art have been reserved unconsciously; the open social form, psychology and the convenience in international communication are the premises for abstract art developing in Shanghai. Chinese abstract art can be born and being developed continuously in Shanghai, it is the results of rationality and possibility of culture. During the 1920s and 1930s, modern art movement emerged in Shanghai, abstract art was in the rudimentary stage, from the later period of the Cultural Revolution to the approaching of the 21st century, the biggest challenges for artists in Shanghai are the experiment for modern painting and the practice for abstract art language. These artists found resolutions and their own artistic language from complicated and chaotic state, they persisted in by conviction and the artists' insight, became the implied key points to connect art history, and formed an important component in Chinese art history. Shanghai has already established its position as Abstract Art's Capital, formed specific regional cultural landscape, abstract painting has already being a representative symbol for contemporary visual culture in Shanghai, and it attracted attention. The first chapter of the dissertation expounds the development of abstract art, and re-examines artistic languages; the second chapter retraces the origin of modern art development in Shanghai, the course of artistic language transformation, and organizes contemporary development courses of abstract art in Shanghai; the third chapter explores the reasons for abstract art in Shanghai, the specific regional cultural phenomenon to emerge and to develop endlessly; the fourth chapter analyses the characteristics of abstract art languages in Shanghai, and generalizes the modes for its oriental artistic thinking to convert modernly; the fifth chapter points out the problems to be faced in the course of abstract art's development in Shanghai, and prospects its future development trend; the last chapter further explains abstract art in Shanghai's position and significance in the course of contemporary art development in China.

Since schools are important places to learn, live and grow for students, students must be strong support for personal safety. Some schools in the face of unexpected events, such as earthquakes, fires, violence, etc., in need of emergency evacuation, led to the evacuation of students crowding each other in time, or even fall trampling each other, resulting in heavy casualties, such as earthquake evacuation of some schools, ineffective when , Hunan, such as the stampede of students on campus. How to reduce casualties in emergency evacuation is an important research topic of related scientific research institutions and administration. A large-scale evacuation simulation is a project that needs a lot of human and material resources. And due to the dependence of human actions and psychological on many external factors, evacuation test is difficult to execute, even for testing. It is also difficult for person to access to the unexpected events, such as a state of panic, test results, to some extent, can not reflect the true situation. Therefore, using a computer to simulate evacuation behavior has become an important technology tool in the international security research. Currently, some achievements have been obtained in the research of evacuation simulation at home and abroad. After analyzing the characteristics of the existing evacuation models, this paper uses the simulation technology of group behavior based on Multi-Agent, and makes improved design of the characteristics of the students groups in the simulation, establish a simulation program of students group in evacuation. It also does some experiments, and makes some data statistics and analyses. The main studies of this paper include: analyze of students group behaviors in the emergencies, build evacuation simulation model for the main behaviors of students groups; research the methods of modeling the flexible structures of a variety of terrain environment, which can easily make the program applied to the various structures of the environment; use and improve the Multi-Agent based simulation technology of group behaviors, and come up with more suitable modeling method for the simulation target of this paper; improve the simulation algorithm of the existing models, including individual and group behaviors movement algorithm, path finding algorithm; use the research results in this evacuation process simulation of this paper to do the simulation, then get statistical data and do the",1869951068,,Dissertations & Theses," Jiang, Tian TianJiangTianTianJiang, Tian Tian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315472531 , 111136292 , 189128 , 10427713 , 10427713", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869951068?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10427713 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emergency+evacuation+simulation+of+students+groups+based+on+vr+technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jiang%2C+Tian+Tian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Post-suharto civil-military relation--indonesia's democracy and transformation,"Translation from original language as provided by author Indonesia's civil-military relation is the most important topic in Indonesian politics. As early as the days of struggling for independence, Indonesian military always perform independently, free from civilian intervention. Beside the real responsibility of military to safeguard national security and unity, Indonesian military actively involved in political affairs. One of the reasons is that after Indonesia gained independence, the country experience a lot of political upheaval and instability, the civilian government appears to be inefficient because of struggles among differing political ideologies. Especially in the field of national security, civilian government appears to be indecisive; this caused the military to look down upon civilian government and like to strengthen their role in politics. This thesis will narrate and analyze the establisment of the Indonesian armed forces and on how the armed forces join effort in struggling for nation's independence, from the earlier days of Netherland's colonial days, inheriting the Japanese military doctrines and then join the fight against Netherland's colonial army. The process was full of contradiction and the building of ideology. But the Indonesian military also perform quite independent beginning from those days. This should the because of the influence of Japanese fascist thinking. Japanese army indoctrinated fascist thinking to Indonesian army and it encourages Indonesian army to get involve in politics. To get involve in political and societal affairs, the Indonesian army actively looked for legitimacy. After succeding in suppressing rebellion in many regions, the Indonesian military enjoyed high political reputation; it becomes an asset tobe actively involved in political and societal affairs. At the time, the international politics was within the ""cold war"" bipolar structure. Strictly speaking, legitimacy is a domestic political affair, but Indonesian military also has to consider on how the international politics may affect domestic political situation. Sides of cold war, the socialist camp and the capitalist camp have supporters in Indonesia; the Indonesian military also has to choose. After the ""9.30 movement"", the right-wing military led by Suharto chose to side with the west's capilatist camp. ""Anti-communist"" became the dominant source of legitimacy for the military to interfere in politics. The military regime led by Suharto exercise ""dual function"", military men enjoys enormous right in political, economic and social fields. Besides positionin military personnel in political position, Suharto also allowed military personnel to get into business and make money. This strengthens Indonesian military control upon the society. However, military regime raises doubts, because of its weak legitimacy. To consolidate its political standing, Indonesian military chose to exagerrate the menace the Indonesian society must face. When on the process ""exagerrating the latent danger"", the Indonesian military also spare no effort to instigate violence in the society, to let the society be in condition of tense and then increase the people's eagerness to be in secure environment, increasing their dependance on the military and police. Violence becomes one of the characteristic of Suharto-led military regime. One side, violence many strengthen Suharto's control toward the society, but on the other side it increases the people's antipathy. The accumulated corruption during the Suharto era exploded during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The military has to face enormous international and domestic pressure and forces to hand over power. Suharto stepped down. The military faced with pressure to reform. Reformer leaders like Abdurahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri understand well the corrupt nature of military intervention in politics and chose to start reform. However, the political assets accumulated by the military during long period let them have bargaining power and resisting civilian's effort to reorganize the military. Reformer politicians and the military started a political struggle and this spill over the society, creating turbulence in the society. But,the free competition environment during the era of democracy provide the Indonesian military an opportunity to get involved in politics again. Politicians with military background join the election; fully use the democratic institution to get back into political",1869972518,,Dissertations & Theses," Liang, Sun YiLiangYiSunLiang, Sun Yi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315585101 , 111108272 , 189128 , 10437433 , 10437433", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869972518?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10437433 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Post-suharto+civil-military+relation--indonesia%27s+democracy+and+transformation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liang%2C+Sun+Yi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The analysis and development studies of anqing track and field advantages project,"Translation from original language as provided by author As a track and field athletic sports main headings, there are many studies about track and field training, but most were directed at a high level of the campaign level.

According to statistics, the head and neck are the most vulnerable parts of human body in vehicle traffic accidents with long-term consequence, especially the neck muscle damage of pilot is still a difficulty in military while the carrier-based aircraft landing. Now medical treatment and compensation related to human head-neck injuries lead to significant social costs, therefore it is a challenge to safety community for research into the head-neck injury mechanisms. The human head and neck responses to impacts are simulated and analyzed using ADAMS in this paper. Firstly the complex anatomy structure of human head-neck is studied, and previous studies of head mechanical loads and injury mechanisms are reviewed. Then the work is developing a new 3D head-neck multi-body model based on the anatomical structure of a real human body using ADAMS. The model consists of rigid head, cervical vertebrae(C1~C7) and thoracic vertebra(T1,T2) connected through nonlinear viscoelastic intervertebral joints representing the lumped behavior and nonlinear stress-strain muscle elements based on biomechanics. Finally the human head-neck model is validated with the front and rear end impacts and the results are acceptable. The boundary and loading conditions were applied according to the condition of the volunteers' tests, also the neck muscle damage is presented. The global kinematics like head translational and angular,movements and accelerations as well as local kinematics such as muscle damage can be predicted with this head-neck multi-body model.

Though usually neglected, income mobility is significant for improving income distribution among rural households, enhancing poverty alleviation and decreasing income inequality. First of all, by international comparisons, this paper analyzes income mobility in some developed countries and developing countries, and concentrates on the differences in income mobility across countries. Secondly, it measures both rank mobility and quantity mobility, and the effect of income mobility on long-term income inequality in rural China from 1989 to 2006. Thirdly, it further assesses the determinants of household income mobility and their contributions to income mobility. And finally, it summarizes the conclusions, policy implications, and makes suggestions for future research. Based on the analysis of this paper number of conclusions can be drawn: Firstly, considerable income mobility equalizes long-term income inequality in developed countries and developing countries. In addition, with economy reform and transition, income of developing countries is more mobile. Moreover, many studies indicate household demographic characters (such as household size, age, gender, etc.), education and employment are important for income mobility. Secondly, there exists considerable mobility of income in rural China from 1989 to 2006. The high degree of rank and quantity mobility implies re-ranking and beta convergence in income distribution. Additionally, the paper also finds considerable transitorily poor and rich in positional mobility. On the one hand, transitorily movement of the poor and rich provides opportunities for both the poor and the rich households to change their income status, and decreases long-term income inequality. On the other hand, however, it also causes considerable income fluctuations and economic insecurity. Moreover, the equalizing effect of income mobility on income inequality is weakened over time with increasing income inequality. Thirdly, households with low initial income level, high share of wage income, high educational level of household members, high number of non-agricultural employed household members, and younger heads are more mobile. Change in the share of non-agricultural employed persons in household, change in the share of wage income and change in the average years of education of household members are the main contributors to the observed inequality in income mobility among all income categories of rural households. However, when analyze the initially poor and rich households, these results appear somehow different with average years of education of household members is more contributive to income mobility for rich households. Fourthly, with re-allocation of labor resources in the household, non-agricultural employment increases return to non-agricultural work and agricultural work by scale operation in agriculture production. Therefore, non-agricultural employment improves household income distribution in rural China. Education and economic return to education also influence income mobility. On the one hand, high average years of education and change in the average years of education of household members foster income mobility among rural households. On the other hand, economic return to education in rural China has been on the rise which increases income mobility. Moreover, economic return to education of non-agricultural employment is higher than that of agricultural work. So, the better educated and non-agriculturally employed have competitive advantages in improving household income. And education is more important for rich households than poor households because of the higher education level and non-agricultural employment among rich household members. So, with the transitory movement of rural households' incomes, the high degree of income mobility over the period provides more chances for farmers. Income mobility equalizes long-term income inequality even if the high annual income inequality. Therefore, it is important for government to adopt policies that creat a fair and competitive environment for boosting development of rural communities in the future. Finally, aiming to promote income mobility in rural China, this paper puts forward proposals for increasing industrialization and urbanization, improving social security and developing agricultural production,",1870386448,,Dissertations & Theses," Shi, Xue HuaShiHuaXueShi, Xue Hua", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316172601 , 111135082 , 189128 , 10430999 , 10430999", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870386448?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAI10430999 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+household+income+mobility+in+rural+china&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shi%2C+Xue+Hua&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Public interest environmental litigation in india and its implication,"Translation from original language as provided by author In recent years, enforcement of environmental law has become an obstacle in environmental protection in China.

The article will give an overview of Indian's PIEL by analyzing its background and implementation effect and point out its advantages and disadvantages and its relationship with environmental law enforcement, hoping to give suggestion to China's PIEL. This article consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 is the background of PIEL in India. The government structure in India provides a guarantee for judicial independence. Indian Emergency in 1974 gave rise to the judicial activism of the Supreme Court. In the following years, Supreme Court established judicial review which laid the foundation for PIEL. As the environmental legal system was undeveloped, the administrative organs were not actively engaged in law enforcement, and the influence of the international environmental protection movements was widespread in India, all these elements directly resulted in the establishment of PIEL. Aiming at achieving social justice, the Supreme Court actively promoted PIEL and opened the courts to citizens especially to the poor and disadvantaged. Chapter 2 is the contents of all the essential elements of PIEL in India. The elements include locus standi, scope of accepting cases and jurisdiction, procedure, remedy, litigation expenses, legal aid and judicial decision. Chapter 3 is the implementation effect of PIEL in India. PIEL improved Indian's environmental legal system, pushed the administrative organs to actively and properly enforced law and promoted public participation in India. However, Supreme Court's excessive judicial activism also brought bad effect to law enforcement. We can learn from Indian's experience that we must deal with the relationship with administrative organ, judiciary and citizen properly. It needs to draw the line of their right and power so as to make them coordinate properly. In addition, we should expand locus standi, simplify procedures, establish commission of inquiry and create flexible remedies to improve citizens' access to justice and protect citizens' environmental rights in",1870569680,,Dissertations & Theses," Kang, Si YingKangYingSiKang, Si Ying", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316331671 , 111111952 , 189128 , 10349593 , 10349593", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870569680?accountid=14496, 0439 Environmental Law, 0439 Environmental Law, 0439 Environmental Law,, 0439 Environmental Law, Environmental Law," (UMI)AAI10349593 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+interest+environmental+litigation+in+india+and+its+implication&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kang%2C+Si+Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Extended supraclavicular fasciocutaneous island flap based on the transverse cervical artery for head and neck reconstruction following cancer ablation,"Translation from original language as provided by author Purpose: After head and neck cancer defects not only lead to facial deformities, can cause severe dysfunction, physical, psychological and social aspects of patients will have adverse impact seriously affected the quality of life of patients. This study aim to explore a new surgical procedure for the head and neck reconstruction following cancer ablation with extended supraclavicular fasciocutaneous island flap based on the transverse cervical artery on the basis of suming up domestic and international research achievement and assess the reliability and usefulness. Methods and Materials: Form july 2008 to december 2009, fifty-three patients with head and neck cancer following ablation were reconstructed by extended supraclavicular fasciocutaneous island flap. Preoperative three- dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3D-CTA) was performed on all patients. Among them, the age of the 33 males patients ranged from 35 to 78 years(average age 57.09±9.6); the age of the 20 males patients ranged from 26 to 81 years(average age 55.35±15.7).

As the father of the American short story, Irving was such a professional in recreating the European derivative with American background. Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow are regarded as his best known tales for they were endowed with American identity and European identity. Meanwhile, Irving's trans-Atlantic literary contribution served as a bridge between the old and new. By analyzing the American identity, European identity and Irving's life experience from a historical perspective, the thesis tries to unveil the truth and effect of American identity and European identity of Washington Irving and his tales. The introduction will begin with a brief introduction on Irving's life experience and literary career. In Chapter One, through exploring the historical backgrounds of American identity and European identity, defines the American identity as a self-realization as an intellectually independent American citizen; the European identity as a derivative of the European cultural heritage. Chapter Two focuses on the traces of identities, particularly on the conflicts and mergence emerged between American identity and European identity. The first section attempts to analyze the conflicts happened between the newcomers and the country folks, in order to reveal the root of the conflicts. By analyzing the rural community life, education reform and migration movement, the second section tries to unveil the American social realities at the first half of 19th century through two symbolic buildings, tavern and the school house, in the Dutch village. Chapter Three focuses on the derivative of American identity and European identity. By analyzing Washington Irving's life experience and literary career, the author takes Irving himself and nostalgia as the fruit of American identity and European identity. The first section deals with some critical phases in Irving's life experience. By analyzing Irving's boyhood education and his visits to Europe at manhood, the author tries to reveal the American identity and European identity of Irving's through their respective presentation. The second section focuses on nostalgia, a specific psychological appreciation to the past. The author characterizes nostalgia as appreciation and orientation. By illustrating the patriotic Hudson River school and Henry James's 29-year-absense from the United States and, the author tries to prove nostalgia as a positive attitude in worshiping the American untamed beauty and in developing cultural sensitivity. The whole thesis concludes with a summary that American identity and European identity have instructed and are instructing the American people in molding and constructing a more diversified and open-mindedness society.

He was an important leader who participated in the formulation and fulfilled Communist Party of China's united front general and specific policies. He was engaged in the Chinese overseas affair for a long time, devoted in the Sino-Japanese friendship enterprise, and made the historical contribution in promoting the unification of the motherland. Through researching and analyzing Liao Chengzhi united front thought, we will excavate his thought's historical value and the practical significance. Besides the introductory remarks and the conclusion, the full text is composed of five parts: The first part mainly analyzes formation of the historic condition of Liao Chengzhi united front thought. First, it is necessary to analyze the rationale which the Liao Chengzhi united front thought forms. Liao Chengzhi was a firm Marxist, and his thought originated from the Marxism basic principle. At the same time, it also couldn't leave the revolution and the construction practice. Second, it is necessary to explore the practical basis which the Liao Chengzhi united front thought forms. In each historical period, the united front presented the different historical characteristics, because it was different in revolutionary and the construction duty. It is the historical frame which the united front thought forms. Finally, it is necessary to explain the subjective condition which Liao Chengzhi united front thought forms. Liao Chengzhi lofty party spirit and outstanding individual moral character casts his ""the individuation"" thought. It is systematically discussed in the second part that the Liao Chengzhi united front thought of the formation and the developing process. In germination period, Liao Chengzhi accepted the patriotic education and sought China revolution's true belief by practice. In forming time, he took the Marxism theory as the instruction and positively set up the anti-Japanese national united front, the overseas Chinese as emerging force. In development time, In view of the united front duty, it was locked in some questions, such as the general overseas Chinese, Sino-Japanese friendship relations, reunification of the motherland as well as world peace. Liao Chengzhi united front thought obtained the development and enrichment in the broad domain. According to Associate Professor Chen Guowen's viewpoint, who is from Guizhou University humanities institute, it integrates the Sino-Japanese friendship in the united front, namely ""Sino-Japanese friendship enterprise united front"". In the perfect time, after the baptism of reform and opening-up, his thought of the united front had a beneficial supplement, and formed a complete theoretical system. The important content of the united front is expounded in the third part. It mainly includes four aspects: the Overseas Chinese affair thought, the Sino-Japanese relations, the world peace thought and the reunification of the motherland thought. The Overseas Chinese affair thought includes four aspects, such as, the Overseas Chinese is mother of the revolutionary; the formulation of overseas relations doesn't conform to the Marxism; Chinese education must be specialized and we must lift up the patriotism flag high; The second part includes ""the folk advance"" and ""To promote official by the public"", developing the Sino-Japanese trade by the evolution type; The third part includes that Chinese people is very fond of peace and peace is the mass movement; The fourth part includes ""the long-term plan, the full use"", the regression of Hong Kong in 1997, ""not dividing the priority in patriotic"" as well as ""One country, two systems"". These four parts constitute the main body of united front thought It is summarized the essential feature of Liao Chengzhi united front thought. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we must insist principle and flexibility; it is necessary to insist the embarking from the national characteristic, breaking the deadlock, and seeking the international cooperation. The Chinese nation and the international trail connection will be realized; we must insist the Marxism Scientific instruction to united front and conform to people's practice activities. The fifth part mainly elaborates the significance of Liao Chengzhi united front thought. Historic importance includes two aspects: providing the strength support to complete the Party's task in various historical period and making the important contributions for enriching party's united front thought; The practical significance includes providing broad mentality for the socialist modernization, the efficient path of impelling the region to be stable, constructing harmonious world and the reality instruction of completing the unification of the",1873760485,,Dissertations & Theses," Yuan, Lu NingYuanNingLuYuan, Lu Ning", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318141311 , 111136292 , 189128 , 10441113 , 10441113", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873760485?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10441113 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+liao+chengzhi%27s+united+front+thought&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yuan%2C+Lu+Ning&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Strategy: A case study of a community college and the dynamic forces at work in its environment,"Past research on strategic planning has been confined largely to for-profit organizations; there is limited research on the strategic planning of nonprofit, public organizations such as institutions of higher education (IHEs), particularly nonprofit, public community colleges.

The study sought to identify the loci of the forces pushing the wearing of the veil. The study is based on the integration of historical analysis with qualitative methods and content analysis. Specifically this research is based on triangulated data from (a) detailed interviews conducted with 65 young Muslim Egyptian women during the summer of 2008, (b) content analysis of 70 sermons delivered by four of the most influential preachers today, and (c) a survey of the history of the veil in Egypt. Findings showed that the veil has become a unique instrument of power employed by several actors at three new and interrelated arenas of struggle. At the social level, women are using the veil to redefine their roles in society. At the political level, they are using various forms of the veil to declare full or partial alliance with counter-hegemonic forces challenging the state’s moral authority and the state’s political liberalization policies that have targeted women. At the global arena of power, women are engaged in a solidarity movement against the West and the forces of globalization. All these tension zones are influenced by new patterns of immigration in the Arab world and by new forms of intraregional globalization fostered by a newly emerging Arab satellite industry. This study was the beginning of research that should continue to investigate through the utilization of novel and more focused integrated methods this particular phenomenon. The struggle to remove the bonds of the West, in particular, invites future research to dissect the many aspects of interregional and intraregional globalization and their impact on religious identities across the world. This research also suggested that the attitudes towards the veil, women, the state, and the West are in a state of flux, requiring the use of novel identity barometers to assess the direction, magnitude, and implications of these changes on the relationships between the West and the Muslim world.",250946173,,Dissertations & Theses," Saleh, YustinaSalehYustinaSaleh, Yustina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2009101441 , 51682101 , 66569 , 9781109694413 , 3397514 , 3397514", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109694413, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250946173?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," Womens studies , Islamic Studies , Middle Eastern Studies , Political science , Social classes , Middle class , Clothing , Clergy , Egypt"," Social sciences , Amr Khaled , Arab satellite media , Digital media , Globalization , Hijab , Iqraa , Islam , Islam and globalization , Muslim fashion , Religious media , Veil , Women and Islam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Confinements+and+liberations%3A+The+many+faces+of+the+veil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Saleh%2C+Yustina&amp;isbn=9781109694413&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Home-range fidelity and the effect of supplemental feeding on contact rates between white-tailed deer (&lt;i&gt;Odocoileus virginianus&lt;/i&gt;) in southern Illinois,"White-tailed deer ( Odocoileous virginianus ) are an important game animal and provide intrinsic value to many people. However, disease has become of great concern within white-tailed deer populations. Frequency of contract drives the establishment and spread of infectious diseases among susceptible hosts. Supplemental feed provided to increase white-tailed deer survival or create hunting opportunities, as well as bait stations to aid in capture of deer, may increase contact opportunities and disease transfer. My objective was to quantify the effects of bait sites on indirect contact between deer. I examined data from global positioning system (GPS) collars placed on 27 deer near Carbondale, Illinois, USA, from 2002 to 2005. Location data from GPS collars were used to ensure that I quantified contacts between deer in separate social groups, based on the volume of intersection of their spatial utilization distributions and correlation of movements. I matched 35 bait site locations and control sites not containing bait based on local land cover composition. Pairwise indirect contacts (locations &lt;25 m and &lt;30 d apart) between deer were tabulated within a 10, 25, 50, 75, or 100-m buffer around each bait and control site. Indirect contact frequencies between bait and control sites were compared using mixed-model Poisson regression with deer pair as a random-effect variable and bait, joint utilization distribution (JUD), and year as fixed-effect variables. Contact frequencies did not differ significantly (P&lt;0.05) between bait sites and control sites at any buffer distance, implying that small bait piles used to capture deer have minimal effect on contact frequencies. However, the effect of more consistent and greater quantities of food distributed during supplemental feeding programs should be studied further to determine its impact on contact rates and spatial distribution of deer. Understanding the spatial distribution of white-tailed deer is important to implement effective disease and population management within localized areas. The objective of this study was to measure the home-range fidelity of female deer in an exurban deer herd in southern Illinois. I compared location data of 7 deer that had been collected in 2004-2005 and 2008. I used the volume of intersection (VI) and percent of home range overlap to statistically compare the two annual home ranges for each deer. Deer were located used ground-based radiotelemetry and home ranges were characterized using a fixed kernel utilization distribution. Comparing home ranges between years, the mean VI was 0.45 with little variation (range 0.35-0.55). I found the mean percent overlap of 50% isopleths to be 47.1% (range 31.3-71.7%) and the mean overlap of 95% isopleths to be 62.0% (range 44.3-68.6%). My results indicate that female white-tailed deer on our study area showed strong home-range fidelity, which could permit disease and population management by removing deer and reducing local deer densities.",578523455,,Dissertations & Theses," Rustand, MatthewRustandMatthewRustand, Matthew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2073739151 , 53190721 , 66569 , 9781124050553 , 1477444 , 1477444", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124050553, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/578523455?accountid=14496, 0286 Wildlife Management, 0286 Wildlife Management, 0286 Wildlife Management,, 0286 Wildlife Management, Wildlife Management," Biological sciences , Contact rates , Disease , Home range , Supplemental feeding , White-tailed deer",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Home-range+fidelity+and+the+effect+of+supplemental+feeding+on+contact+rates+between+white-tailed+deer+%28Odocoileus+virginianus%29+in+southern+Illinois&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rustand%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781124050553&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Essays on economic *growth, education, and the distribution of income: A structural analysis for the case of South Africa","Since the fall of the Apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, the democratically elected post-Apartheid governments have engaged in social and economic reforms aimed at improving the welfare of millions of the left outs during that regime, and at enhancing economic growth. Among these reforms, the most important have consisted of achieving structural transformation of the South African economy through technological advancements, improving skills by investing massively in human capital through education and training, reducing income inequality across racial groups through access to programs that facilitate the acquisition of skills by the left outs of the Apartheid regime rather than through massive income redistribution, liberalizing the labor markets and the formation of labor unions, privatizing statal and para-statal corporations and abolishing monopolies in public services, liberalizing trade and capital movements, promoting new investment through tax incentives, promoting private initiative, reducing or at least freezing government expenditures, reducing poverty, and so on. In this dissertation, I analyze the relationship between growth and some aspects of the economy targeted by the aforementioned reforms through two separate essays. In the first essay (Essay 1), I analyze the growth and welfare effects of public spending on education in post-Apartheid South Africa while in the second essay (Essay 2) I investigate the dynamics of income inequality, poverty, and growth in the post-Apartheid South Africa. Starting with Essay 1, since the abolition of its Apartheid regime in 1994, South Africa has launched a massive program of education and training, which has been financed through resources representing annually on average 21% of the national budget, or 7% of GDP. Today, the GDP share of public spending on education is 1.3 times the average of industrialized countries (5.4%) and almost twice that of developing countries (3.9%). In this essay, I simulate fiscal policy experiments to analyze the growth and welfare effects of a reduction in or an elimination of spending on education in a model of endogenous growth with human capital accumulation and policies for the Post Apartheid South African economy. The first and second experiments consist of reducing the GDP share of educational spending to the averages of industrialized and developing countries, respectively; while the third experiment consists of eliminating government spending on the educational sector (a 100% tax reduction). The results of the simulations demonstrate that a reduction in or an elimination of educational spending reduces the long run rates as well as the transition rates of growth, in per capita GDP, the wages of skilled workers, and overall welfare. The effects on the other variables in the economy (physical capital, human capital, labor, consumption, and the interest rate) vary across experiments. However, these growth and welfare effects are small. Turning to Essay 2, I construct a model of growth with heterogeneity in asset holdings and skills and calibrate it to the Post-Apartheid South African economy in order to analyze the dynamics of income distribution, income inequality, poverty, and growth. I find that growth is achieved at all levels of incomes and poverty is totally eliminated by the end of the process, which lasts 73 years (from 1993 to 2065). Furthermore, the economy achieves the overall convergence of incomes to the income of the average consumer in the distribution. Indeed, poor consumers improve their relative positions of in the distribution of wealth as well as in that of income while rich consumers worsen theirs. Next, I combine the results of the heterogeneous model with the microeconomic data (the South Africa’s 1996 October Household Survey) to estimate the distribution of income, and to analyze thoroughly the interaction between growth, income inequality, and poverty. I find that a one percent increase in the rate of growth of income causes on average poverty to drop by 3.7%, using the $2 per day poverty-line, and by 1.3% using the $1 per day poverty-line. Moreover, growth causes overall decline in income inequality but the effect is very small. A one percent-increase in the rate of growth of income results on average in a decline in income inequality of only 0.056% by the Gini coefficient and of 0.11% by the Global Theil Index.",580592979,,Dissertations & Theses," Badibanga, Thaddee MutumbaBadibangaMutumbaThaddeeBadibanga, Thaddee Mutumba", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2074456921 , 53212811 , 66569 , 9781124045252 , 3408365 , 3408365", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124045252, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/580592979?accountid=14496," 0511 Economic theory , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0511 Economic theory , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0511 Economic theory , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies",," 0511 Economic theory , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," Economic theory , Sub Saharan Africa Studies , Studies , Economic growth , South Africa"," Social sciences , Economic growth , Growth , Human capital , Income distribution , Income inequality , Poverty , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+economic++*growth%2C+education%2C+and+the+distribution+of+income%3A+A+structural+analysis+for+the+case+of+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Badibanga%2C+Thaddee+Mutumba&amp;isbn=9781124045252&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Arouse the conscience—The photography of Alexander Gardner,"Alexander Gardner is a Scottish photographer best known for his work during the Civil War era. In addition to producing hundreds of his own photographs over the course of his nearly twenty-year career, he oversaw the production of the war's most talented corps of photographers, and he produced the seminal photographically illustrated history of the war, Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War (1866). Although Gardner's photographic production is the most well known of this era, he and his work are also the least understood. Through an exploration of Sketch Book , this dissertation engages the key issues relating to Gardner's biography, his contribution to American photography, his photographic practice, and his treatment of three interrelated topics: the role of African Americans during the war and in its aftermath; the meaning of slavery to the war and its origins; and the war's meaning and its memorialization. Chapter one offers new details of Gardner's life in Scotland and his relationship to radical politics, his exposure to photography, and his life in Washington, D.C. In an outline of the kind of photography and discussions about photography Gardner was exposed to in Europe, this chapter establishes the foundation for his artistic vision. In addition, understanding his interest in reform movements provides key insight into the choices he made as a visual artist and the personal and artistic alliances he cultivated throughout his life. The second chapter argues that the form of Gardner's Sketch Book was inspired by contemporary discussions within the international reform community about travel as a critical practice and new media as a tool to effect social change, and sought to present a visual argument for photographs as visual histories. In chapter three, an extended discussion of an image in Sketch Book demonstrates that Gardner was more sensitive to the African American experience than scholars have previously acknowledged. Chapter four continues a discussion of African Americans in Sketch Book , and argues that the presence of African Americans in the book serves to question the theme of national reconciliation that many scholars have seen as central to the project.",608970935,,Dissertations & Theses," Best, Makeda DjataBestDjataMakedaBest, Makeda Djata", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2079393381 , 53320601 , 66569 , 9781124080840 , 3414633 , 3414633", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124080840, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/608970935?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Alexander Gardner , Civil War photography , Photography",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Arouse+the+conscience%E2%80%94The+photography+of+Alexander+Gardner&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Best%2C+Makeda+Djata&amp;isbn=9781124080840&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""&lt;i&gt;Más allá del fútbol&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;La Bomba,&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;afrochoteño&lt;/i&gt; subaltern, and cultural change in Ecuador's &lt;i&gt;Chota-Mira&lt;/i&gt; Valley","Based on a 2007 Fulbright funded documentary film project; this dissertation concerns the highland Afro-Ecuadorian communities of the Chota-Mira valley. The afrochoteños are the direct descendents of enslaved Africans brought to the region by Jesuits to labor the local sugar-cane plantations during the seventeenth century. Their particular history, cultural traditions, beliefs, customs, and ways of life distinguish them from Ecuador’s indigenous, mestizo, and coastal black population. Despite their contribution to the nation’s development and identity as a pluri-cultural state, the afrochoteños face extreme social, political, and economic marginalization as a result of their displacement and origins with the trans-Atlantic slave trade, subjugation and oppression as slaves, uneven integration, and continued exploitation and discrimination post emancipation. As such, the afrochoteños are made invisible in representations of the nation’s history and culture, save only for their presence on the national soccer team. While academic interest in topics concerning Afro-Hispanic and Afro-Andean communities is growing, much work remains in not only documenting, but critically exploring these subaltern histories and traditions in terms of the stories of oppression, struggle, resistance, and hope they tell. I thus examine the afrochoteño song and dance genre known as La Bomba in relation to the socio-historical development and struggles of the afrochoteño communities as a means of illuminating afrochoteño culture and their condition as subalterns. Though marginalized for much of the twentieth century, La Bomba is today recognized nationally as a symbol of afrochoteño identity thanks in part to a revival spurred by the cultural preservation efforts of the Afro-Ecuadorian sociopolitical project and movement known as etnoeducación. This initiative seeks to validate and strengthen afrochoteño identity in reclaiming local traditions and educating afrochoteño youth about Afro-Ecuadorian history and culture. Renewed interest in La Bomba is introducing stylistic changes, however, as afrochoteño youth incorporate foreign instruments, rhythms, and genres such as congas, salsa, and reggaeton. While some afrochoteños see such changes as a threat to the integrity of La Bomba and afrochoteño identity, others, in particular the youth who listen to and produce these newer Bomba fusions, see no such conflict and strongly identify with La Bomba as an expression of their distinct cultural identity. Though La Bomba ’s recent development raises questions concerning the impact of globalization on afrochoteño culture, it also provides a means of seeing how the afrochoteños ’ struggle as subalterns is implicated in the process of cultural change. Building on post-colonial and subaltern theories, I explore the ways in which La Bomba registers the afrochoteño experience of and response to racism, exploitation, and marginalization in Ecuador. In its revival and transformation, we can see how afrochoteños resource tradition and engage memory and global flows in their contestation of the epistemological hegemony that produces their subalternity. I argue that La Bomba ’s transformation is best approached in terms of agency rather than cultural loss or retention. Examined in this way, we can begin to understand change in this context not as an inevitable consequence of globalization, but as the means by which La Bomba and afrochoteño identity persist.",746490732,,Dissertations & Theses," Ruggiero, Diana MabelRuggieroMabelDianaRuggiero, Diana Mabel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2117501331 , 54015701 , 66569 , 9781124153056 , 3417594 , 3417594", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124153056, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/746490732?accountid=14496," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Black studies , Cultural anthropology , Dance , Music , Latin American Studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Afrochoteno , Bomba , Chota-Mira Valley , Cultural change , Ecuador",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=M%C3%A1s+all%C3%A1+del+f%C3%BAtbol%3A+La+Bomba%2C+the+afrochote%C3%B1o+subaltern%2C+and+cultural+change+in+Ecuador%27s+Chota-Mira+Valley&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ruggiero%2C+Diana+Mabel&amp;isbn=9781124153056&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The dialectics of identity and resistance among Dalits in Nepal,"Based on two broad constituent samples, this dissertation investigates the dialectics—content, modalities and processes—of identity across and between two sites of Dalit life in Kathmandu, Nepal: everyday community and organized political advocacy. These samples comprised, respectively, (1) householders from three occupationally segregated Dalit neighborhoods, encompassing discrete communities of sweepers, metalworkers and tailors/musicians; (2) individual Dalit activists in the political sphere. Through 43 interviews with community members and 41 interviews with activists, the research investigated the modalities of identity across everyday and civil-society space and across class, caste, gender and generation. Research questions specifically sought to uncover constraints and possibilities of everyday identities and organized/activist political identities and further differences of gender, class and generation. The study revealed strong evidence of the continuing embeddedness of caste in Kathmandu. Their everyday experiences of discrimination force both community and political actors to strategically reveal or conceal their Dalit status depending on the situation. Evidence of resistance ranged from everyday individual acts to collective organized forms. The community ethnography revealed important differences across the sweeper, metal-worker and tailor-musician communities. The gender neutrality of the sweeper occupation allows sweeper women relatively more autonomy than that found in the two other occupational caste groups. The tailor/musician group showed all indicators of social mobility into the middle class and had adopted a caste-denying discourse that allowed them to embrace their musical traditions as an ethnic asset that was parlayed into commercial success. The political site revealed two important contradictions. First, Dalit activists based in political parties tend to privilege the nation-state and its bounded sovereignty as the strategic and ultimate terrain upon which the struggle for full Dalit inclusion is fought, while Dalit advocates based in non-governmental organizations appeal primarily to international human rights and the claims to universal human dignity. Second, there is a tension between the private lives of Dalit activists in which they negotiate everyday oppression and their public lives as proactive and empowered political actors. Finally, the important political moment of the People’s Movement of April 2006 united Dali activists to fight locally for full citizenship rights.",746583852,,Dissertations & Theses," Kharel, SambriddhiKharelSambriddhiKharel, Sambriddhi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2118330581 , 54030241 , 66569 , 9781124149509 , 3417446 , 3417446", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124149509, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/746583852?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Womens studies , Social structure , Dialects , Social identity , Segregation , Neighborhoods , Politics , Nepal"," Social sciences , Dalit , Gender and space , Identity , Nepal , Resistance , South Asia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+dialectics+of+identity+and+resistance+among+Dalits+in+Nepal&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kharel%2C+Sambriddhi&amp;isbn=9781124149509&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Muslim women and &lt;i&gt;shari'ah&lt;/i&gt; tribunals: Examining liberal -secular hegemonies,"This dissertation examines the contentions in consolidating the supremacy of liberal-secular ideals and the reproduction of Orientalist discourses in the context of the Canadian state and its social relation formation by examining the debates about Ontario shari'ah tribunals. A major focus of the debates was that Islamic laws do not embody gender equality; hence, Muslims need to draw on secular laws when resolving family disputes to assure women's rights. There was also an insistence on maintaining the separation of church and state and to render religion to the private realm as Canada considers itself a liberal-secular state. However, I argue that the borders between secular and religious and public and private spheres are always in flux; also that such a suggestion assumes a priori boundary stability between these sites that is not present. Such a dominant idea also is informed and shaped by a presumed set of Western values (Christian Reform movements, Enlightenment thought etc.). These prevailing liberal-secular values are in a sharp contrast to a Qur'anic worldview as the latter orientation considers God as the centre of existence and the former regards humankind as the centre of existence. Although these differences are important, the critics opposed anything outside of the liberal-secular framework. Muslim and non-Muslim interlocutors, thus, ended up re-centralizing liberal practices that embodied colonialism. Further, the critics articulated approaches that converge with Orientalist discourses as they depict Islam as an inherently ""oppressive"" religion and Muslim women as its ""victims."" Such a convergence then makes possible colonial relations where Muslims are expected to comply with liberal-secular normative values even when they disagree with them. In this dissertation, I also argue that the standpoint of those who supported the Ontario shari'ah tribunals is a shortsighted one. The proponents do not seem to have enough resources to undertake the task of utilizing the shari'ah tribunals effectively. The supporters' views also do not assure the rights of women as they have overlooked the shifting circumstances in which many Canadian Muslims live. Because of these realizations, I argue that the proponents must engage with ijtihad (individual and/or critical intellectual reasoning) to tackle the question of Muslim women's rights and the Qur'an must be read holistically where its core moral values should exemplify gender relations. Such an engagement with the shari'ah laws also has a global relevance because concerns regarding women's rights are not limited to the Canadian context, rather Muslims around the world are grappling with them. In sum, Ontario shari'ah tribunals not only have emphasized that there is an urgent need that Muslims re-examine Islamic family laws, but they also have underscored how different aspects of liberal-secular ideals can become modes of racialization and can feed into racist ideologies as they reproduce Orientalist discourses.",748283419,,Dissertations & Theses," Ruby, Tabassum FahimRubyFahimTabassumRuby, Tabassum Fahim", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2124586391 , 54140861 , 66569 , 9780494649497 , NR64949 , NR64949", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494649497, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/748283419?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0318 Religion , 0453 Womens studies , 0700 Social structure"," Religion , Womens studies , Social structure , Muslims , Christians , Liberalism , Canadians , Secularism , Canada"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Islam , Liberal-secular , Muslim women , Women's rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Muslim+women+and+shari%27ah+tribunals%3A+Examining%0Aliberal+-secular+hegemonies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ruby%2C+Tabassum+Fahim&amp;isbn=9780494649497&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Topos, carnavales y vecinos. Derivas de lo rural en la literatura y el cine de la transición española (1973–1986)","The so-called “Spanish transition to democracy” was a time of uncertainty and political turmoil in which the Spanish people looked forward, but also a period in which they had to deal with the effects of the strong socio-economic changes experienced during the dictatorship. Questions about areas rapidly transformed by Franco’s “desarrollismo” emerged, particularly about the rural world, which had suffered a severe depopulation and a significant dislocation of its cultural identity. The artistic circles of the transition period began to take interest in the fate of this fragile world: Spanish artists collected testimonies of rural hardship and survival, satirized the maladjustment of migrant villagers to the cities, and wrote novels recreating oral legends told by old peasants. This dissertation studies such cultural interventions in a moment that was not only decisive for the creation of parliamentary democracy in Spain, but also for the country's full entry into an industrial, urban and global consumer society. In its three chapters, it tries to assess to what extent testimonial strategies were used to account for rural marginalization or to perpetuate it, what kind of cultural translation was needed for the avant-garde to connect with the remains of popular and carnivalesque traditions, and, finally how often “realist” authors were capable of going beyond a merely idealized and mimetic understanding of collective peasant traditions. To address these issues it is necessary to connect the stories and documentaries of artists like Ramiro Pinilla, Pilar Miró and Basilio Martín Patino with the pro-amnesty movement and the denunciation of the dictatorial legacy, the provocations of avant-garde artists such as Almodovar and Ocaña with the counter-cultural and underground cultural scene, and the realist proposals of authors like Mateo Díez, Delibes or Montxo Armendariz with emerging environmentalism and peripheral nationalisms. These dialogues draw the map of three artistic drifts of rural culture that provided tools for the construction of the post-dictatorial present and form part of the complicated debate about how Spanish society should treat its profoundly changed pre-industrial and pre-capitalist legacy. At the same time, this thesis exposes the trend towards a new paradigm: that of the rural world as a supposedly disappeared social area, relegated to a mythical, magical or legendary past, which can provide adequate entertainment in the new mass-media society, but that appears too distant to influence the present in any way.",816604936,,Dissertations & Theses," Moreno-Caballud, LuisMoreno-CaballudLuisMoreno-Caballud, Luis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2208243581 , 51439631 , 66569 , 9781124351032 , 3435973 , 3435973", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124351032, Spanish, Spanish,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/816604936?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies",," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies"," Romance literature , European history , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Contemporary Spanish film , Cultural studies , Film , Popular culture , Rural cultures , Spain , Transition to democracy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Topos%2C+carnavales+y+vecinos.+Derivas+de+lo+rural+en+la+literatura+y+el+cine+de+la+transici%C3%B3n+espa%C3%B1ola+%281973%E2%80%931986%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moreno-Caballud%2C+Luis&amp;isbn=9781124351032&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Sustainability Implications of Alternative Feedlot Management Practices and On-ranch Genetic Evaluations in Beef Cattle,"The demand on agriculture to produce healthy and wholesome products will increase along with the growing world population. The social movement towards sustainability has also applied pressure on agriculture to produce food in a manner that is more efficient, better for the environment, and satisfies societal needs. Sustainability in agriculture has broad goals (USDA, 2007), and encompasses three main aspects: environmental wellbeing, economic sufficiency, and human social needs. However, it is difficult to satisfy all three aspects of sustainability due to the conflicting nature of those aspects (Heitschmidt et al., 1996). Alternative production practices (e.g., natural and organic) have been proposed as a more sustainable option to conventional practices. Often these alternative practices rely less heavily on modern technological inputs and rely more on ""natural"" inputs (e.g., integrated pest management instead of chemical pesticides, manure application in place of synthetic fertilizer). Technologies such as metabolic modifiers offer efficiency enhancement in beef production (Preston, 1999) and DNA-based technology offers an opportunity to improve the accuracy of genetic evaluations and response to selection (Pollak, 2005). Increasing attention is being given to the environmental implications of animal agriculture, especially as they relate to greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are the GHG of great importance to global warming, with the latter two being most relevant in animal agriculture. Animal calorimetry and digestive modeling offer methods to measure and predict GHG emissions, respectively (Kebreab et al., 2006). Conventional feedlot management systems often utilize metabolic modifiers (growth promoting implants, beta-adrenergic agonists, and ionophores) to improve efficiency and profits. In contrast, Never Ever 3 is a feedlot management system where cattle never receive growth promotants, antibiotics, or animal fed by-products and as such is representative of a ""natural"" production system. System-based research is needed to determine the contributions of conventional and alternative systems to the goals of sustainability. Genetic evaluations have allowed for the genetic improvement of beef cattle through increased accuracy of selection and response to selection. Expected progeny differences ( EPD ) are the expected performance values of an offspring based on performance records and pedigree expressed as a deviation from the population mean (Bourdon, 2000). Goals of genetic evaluation and the use of EPDs include selection of high performance animals for economically-relevant traits with the objective of ultimately improving the profitability of beef operations (Enns and Garrick, 2003). Breed associations are responsible for the production of these EPDs. The American Angus Association ( AAA ) is the association that generates EPDs for the Angus breed. While breed association EPDs offer great benefits towards genetic improvement, they do not take into account the environmental effects associated with a specific ranch. According to Pollak (2005) breed association EPDs may not translate perfectly to use on the commercial ranch due to the fact that the data used for EPD generation is often collected at the purebred level and the fact that few carcass data are collected. Therefore commercial producers may benefit from the production of ranch-specific EPDs. Paternity determination based on DNA marker technology has enabled pedigree determination and thus generation of EPDs when multiple-sire breeding pastures are used, which is often the case in commercial operations. On-ranch EPDs offer benefits including sire evaluation based on performance specific to that ranch and evaluation of traits not included in breed association evaluations. Therefore comparison of the performance of AAA EPDs to on-ranch EPDs is needed to evaluate the benefits associated with the generation of the ranch specific evaluations.",817398856,,Dissertations & Theses," Cooprider, Krista LynnCoopriderLynnKristaCooprider, Krista Lynn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2211411401 , 54819591 , 66569 , 9781124348315 , 1487239 , 1487239", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124348315, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/817398856?accountid=14496, 0475 Animal sciences, 0475 Animal sciences, 0475 Animal sciences,, 0475 Animal sciences, Animal sciences, Biological sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustainability+Implications+of+Alternative+Feedlot+Management+Practices+and+On-ranch+Genetic+Evaluations+in+Beef+Cattle&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cooprider%2C+Krista+Lynn&amp;isbn=9781124348315&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Unguarded border: The movement of people and ideas between the United States and Canada during the Vietnam War era,"This study considers the confluence of several conditions that existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s: the Vietnam War, U.S. involvement in it, public opposition to the war, emigration from the United States, and Canada’s proximity to the United States. Young American men implicated in the military draft, sympathetic family members, and others discontent with social and political conditions in the United States, often could find opportunities and incentives to leave. Travel literature about Canada and draft advice manuals painted generally positive portrayals of Canada and of immigration there.

Canadian religious organizations had genuine interest in providing assistance to American émigrés, but also had political motivations for their charity, hoping to attract the attention of the Canadian public and government with their good deeds. Many men went to Canada, not only to avoid the draft, but also to pursue graduate or professional degrees. Their immigration coincided with a surge in nationalistic pride in Canada, brought on by celebration of the centennial of Canadian nationhood, and a movement by some in Canadian higher education to discourage admission of Americans to Canadian universities out of concern they would bring American sensibilities to Canadian classrooms. Finally this study considers the meaning of citizenship to Vietnam War–era American émigrés to Canada. That meaning changed frequently in the 1970s, owing to the lack of tolerance for them by the Richard Nixon administration, and Gerald Ford’s conditional clemency and Jimmy Carter’s near-unconditional amnesty for their violations of draft and military laws, and reform of Canadian immigration laws. This study places the Vietnam War–era immigration of Americans to Canada into the context of global migration. The more cosmopolitan worldview of young Americans who moved to Canada in the Vietnam War era, located in their connections to grass-roots movements, religious communities, and higher education, combined a profound sense of unboundedness with a willful ignorance of constraints, and demonstrated an original sense of the spaces through and to which they could move.",822233769,,Dissertations & Theses," Maxwell, Donald WilliamMaxwellWilliamDonaldMaxwell, Donald William", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2229241691 , 56865411 , 66569 , 9781124355436 , 3432124 , 3432124", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124355436, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822233769?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," Canadian history , American history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Canada , Citizenship , Draft evasion , Higher education , Immigration , Religion , United States-Canada , Vietnam War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unguarded+border%3A+The+movement+of+people+and+ideas+between+the+United+States+and+Canada+during+the+Vietnam+War+era&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maxwell%2C+Donald+William&amp;isbn=9781124355436&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Local justice organizing in post-Katrina New Orleans: A first world case of community opposition to globalization,"In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, two paths emerged in the rebuilding of New Orleans; one was from above and the other from below. This study focuses on the agency of the latter and its opposition to the former. Local justice organizing in post-Katrina New Orleans provides an opportunity to empirically examine opposition to processes of globalization in a First World setting. The analysis relies on local multi-site ethnographic field research done between fall 2007 and summer 2008. The three sites of investigation are the Lower Ninth Ward, the anti-demolition public housing campaign, and immigrant Latino labor organizing. The central sociological purpose of this study is to examine the role of race and culture in local justice organizing in an era of global integration. To address this I turn to theories and concepts drawn from the work of John Foran (political cultures of opposition), Michael Omi and Howard Winant (racial formations), and William I. Robinson (globalization) to introduce a new model that synthesizes and integrates their theories of globalization, race, and culture during social struggle. In the Lower Ninth Ward, organizing strategies were divided between white non-local volunteers and African American residents. In public housing, a very broad coalition that emerged in late fall 2007 undertook a vigorous campaign to stop demolitions under an internationalized human rights framework. Immigrant Latino labor organizing responded to anti-immigrant sentiments with non-violent strategies while advocates used service provision as an organizing tool to raise awareness and develop stronger labor justice campaigns. Overall, negative experiences with the rebuilding movement from above elicited strong emotions and ideas of justice that led individuals to become part of local justice organizations. The study traces the formation/origins of these diverse and fragile coalitions, documenting their internal difficulties and external hardships as well as their visions and occasional victories through a precise and evocative narrative analysis based on the interactions and conversations of their members and followers.",851547241,,Dissertations & Theses," Lopez, Edwin IgorLopezIgorEdwinLopez, Edwin Igor", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2265987261 , 58252461 , 66569 , 9781124446141 , 3439452 , 3439452", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124446141, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/851547241?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Sociology , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Culture , Globalization , Hurricane katrina , New orleans , Race , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Local+justice+organizing+in+post-Katrina+New+Orleans%3A+A+first+world+case+of+community+opposition+to+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lopez%2C+Edwin+Igor&amp;isbn=9781124446141&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A network of associations: Aesthetic painting and its patrons, 1870–1914","This study reframes transatlantic Aesthetic painting as a visual language of interconnection and systematic organization, with an emphasis on its development and dissemination through patronage networks in England and America. It foregrounds the paintings of James McNeill Whistler, Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, and Dwight Tryon, among others, as actively meaningful and mobile objects thoroughly engaged with the “networked” mentality of their historical moment. Although Aesthetic paintings are often regarded as having had a primarily negative value, serving an escapist function by isolating and insulating their owners from the pressures of the modern industrial world, they were often favored by the very politicians, financiers, and corporate leaders who shaped that world. Through a series of case studies, I offer a new account of the movement’s transatlantic evolution and significance, arguing that in form and in function, Aesthetic paintings articulated, rather than evaded, the essentially incorporated and networked character of the commercial and political arenas in which turn-of-the-century patrons were so intimately involved. I have chosen as my organizing theme the concept of the network, which experienced a remarkable transformation from mid-century, when it was primarily attached to concrete systems (railroad tracks, telegraph wires), to the 1890s, when it was extended to include invisible forces and sensations (such as a network of political machinations). This shift signals the emergence of a new type of integrative conceptual thinking that considered diverse individuals and things to be connected through overt and covert lines of influence and communication—an idea exemplified by the incorporated and vertically integrated business, the behind-the-scenes political maneuverings of the club world, and even the popular spiritualist séance. In the midst of this networked moment emerged the Aesthetic Movement in interior decoration, whose advocates insisted that all aspects of a decorated room must be brought into a harmonious relationship, and that even the curve of a table leg might exert a moral and psychological influence on that room’s inhabitants. The pictorial arts played an active role in such interiors, and my analysis of Aesthetic paintings is the first to situate them within this networked decorative, social, and psychological context. The overarching goal of “A Network of Associations” is to make British and American Aesthetic paintings legible to contemporary scholarship in new ways, primarily by recuperating the integrative priorities shared by many of their turn-of-the-century makers, owners, and viewers. Following an introductory essay that outlines the systematic aspects of Aestheticism through a reconsideration of Whistler’s Peacock Room, three case studies explore how Aesthetic networks operated in political, philanthropic, and corporate spheres—from the impact of Burne-Jones’s Perseus series upon the constitution of Tory politician Arthur James Balfour’s interpersonal relationships and public reputation, to the surprising points of intersection between Dewing’s garlanded women and the Detroit railroad car building combines managed by Charles Lang Freer. Poised between these transatlantic poles, a central chapter on the New York mansion and art collections of Henry Gurdon Marquand captures the changing meanings attached to Aesthetic pictures and furnishings as they were transported from England to America and installed within a decorative interior whose points of reference were at once local, national, and global.",854512860,,Dissertations & Theses," Deusner, Melody BarnettDeusnerBarnettMelodyDeusner, Melody Barnett", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2280787231 , 54954131 , 66569 , 9781124479477 , 3440466 , 3440466", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124479477, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/854512860?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0650 Aesthetics"," 0377 Art history , 0650 Aesthetics"," 0377 Art history , 0650 Aesthetics",," 0377 Art history , 0650 Aesthetics"," Art history , Aesthetics"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Aestheticism , Collecting , Patronage , Transatlanticism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+network+of+associations%3A+Aesthetic+painting+and+its+patrons%2C%0A1870%E2%80%931914&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deusner%2C+Melody+Barnett&amp;isbn=9781124479477&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Jokering as queer ministry: Queer theology meets Theatre of the Oppressed,"The convergence of queer theory with emergent queer theological thought has led to groundbreaking theologizing not just for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (hereafter ""queer"") thought, but for the broader range of academic theological thought as well. Queer theologies have moved from simple ""apologetics"" (for example, the movement towards affirmation/inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people within ecclesial systems,) to forging new theological ground through a uniquely queer lens (for example, in the theological exploration of the profound intersections between sexuality, gender transgression, and global economic systems). Despite this irruption of new thought, however, a noticeable gap has emerged between queer theological thought and lived praxis. The historical rootedness of queer theologies within the contextual knowledge of the body makes this gap all the more troubling and pronounced. Queer theologies, uniquely positioned to challenge the historical academic and ecclesial mind-body split, run the risk of disconnecting from the embodied realities of the communities for whom it aims to speak. I will explore, through academic and applied action research, the assertion that Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) offers a unique bridge between queer theological thought and queer theological praxis. Theatre of the Oppressed, created by Brazilian director, activist, and educator Augusto Boal, is a rich and varied set of theatrical methodologies designed not only to break down the separation between actor and audience, but also to bridge the gap between art and activism. This thesis aims to bring into conversation two key thinkers: Augusto Boal, the originator of the Theatre of the Oppressed school of thought and methodologies, and Marcella Althaus-Reid, a preeminent queer and global theologian. Each brings an important piece to this theological puzzle to complement the other: Boal, the critical engagement of oppressive realities through theatrical praxis, and Althaus-Reid, the critical analysis of religio-ecclesial oppressions through theological reflection. The thesis includes a theatre project utilizing action research through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a Theatre of the Oppressed workshop focusing on queer theological issues within two very different communities. The project will explore the question at the heart of this thesis: Can Theatre of the Oppressed be used to bridge the gap between queer theological thought and queer theological praxis? Through the use of TO methods, the project will aim to move from academic text to embodied theatre work, to test TO as a potential methodology that may be used in religious and secular settings committed to queer theological praxis, and to assess TO's effectiveness as an applied theological tool in the identification, articulation, and exploration of issues identified by community members committed to queer social justice. Through these academic and applied explorations, a new queer theological methodology is discovered that helps to bridge the gap between thought and praxis, and that will have practical applied potentialities for queer religious and secular communities. A prophetically challenging and theologically rooted queer ministerial praxis will begin to emerge as a result of this conversation.",854854586,,Dissertations & Theses," Mesner, KerriMesnerKerriMesner, Kerri", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2281914691 , 58802971 , 66569 , 9780494707302 , MR70730 , MR70730", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494707302, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/854854586?accountid=14496," 0469 Theology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0469 Theology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0469 Theology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0469 Theology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," Theology , GLBT Studies , Performing Arts"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jokering+as+queer+ministry%3A+Queer+theology+meets+Theatre+of+the+Oppressed&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mesner%2C+Kerri&amp;isbn=9780494707302&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Cesate Quarter and the Re-Invention of Modern Architecture in Milan, 1945–1955","During the middle decades of the twentieth century, modern architecture was significantly re-shaped as it expanded from a relatively small, local phenomenon centered in northern Europe to an international movement. Italy was among those places where modernism was most radically re-invented, reflecting the Italian experience of Fascism and the Second World War. The Cesate quarter, a large, working-class residential project on the northwest periphery of Milan, exemplifies this re-invention. Designed between 1950 and 1954 by a team of architects led by Franco Albini, Ignazio Gardella, and Ernesto Rogers, the quarter comprises approximately 500 single-family homes and a single, four-story apartment building with 98 units. The quarter was commissioned under a national plan to construct public housing that the newly-elected Christian Democrats initiated in 1949 in order to solidify the democratic ideals of the new country and to reinforce traditional Italian culture. Constrained in part by official policy, the architects of the Cesate quarter used elements of the abstract formal vocabulary of prewar modernism to craft a design that evoked the variegated landscapes of historic Italian settlements, with their winding streets and neighborhood piazzas. Because of the social aspirations of the architects, as well as their sensitivity to local conditions, both historical and environmental, the Cesate quarter and postwar Italian architecture in general have been characterized as Neorealist. First popularized to describe Italian cinema and literature in the years immediately following the war, this term was introduced into the architectural discourse in the mid-1950s. Despite the initial claims that Neorealist cinema and literature were the direct outgrowth of the revolutionary impulses of the reconstruction, recent scholarship has demonstrated that they were in fact deeply rooted in prewar practices. This dissertation shows that Neorealist architecture, too, was the culmination of lines of research initiated in the 1930s that gained new currency in the tumultuous political and cultural environment that followed the war.",858215657,,Dissertations & Theses," Mekinda, JonathanMekindaJonathanMekinda, Jonathan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2299868051 , 55027661 , 66569 , 9781124521367 , 3447514 , 3447514", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124521367, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858215657?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture",," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," Art history , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Cesate Quarter , Italy , Milan , Modern architecture , Modernism , Neorealism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Cesate+Quarter+and+the+Re-Invention+of+Modern+Architecture+in+Milan%2C+1945%E2%80%931955&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mekinda%2C+Jonathan&amp;isbn=9781124521367&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Freedom betrayed: ngos and the challenges of neoliberal development in the post-apartheid era,"This thesis explores transformations in South African NGOs in the Post-Apartheid era. It focuses on auditing and partnerships.Â  In applying a governmentality framework to the neoliberalisation of development in South Africa, this research investigates how development provides a context for governmental technologies and what forms of NGOs they produce. A research strategy was employed that included in-depth interviews, observation research and other ethnographic techniques. The democratic transition and successive funding crises gave birth to a new, more streamlined NGO model which can be characterised by flexibility fluency in auditing techniques and the ability to maintain multisectoral partnerships.Â  Partnerships affect the activities and values of NGOs and provide a cross-sectoral context for the circulation of particular auditing technologies and types of expertise.Â  Indeed it is argued that the entanglement of NGOs in intersectoral spaces is not only heightened by the prevalence of the partnership agenda in global development and in the new South Africaâ��s reconciliation project â��NGO activity very much produces these kinds of intermeshing spaces. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) is shown to be a key demand of partnerships, thus further reinforcing an audit culture. NGOs by acting as expert and translator of these apparently mundane techniques to other civil society organisations (CSOs), actively shape practices of development and may come to substitute for civil society.Â  There is continuity between the partnership practices by which â�� contrary to their emancipatory claims â�� NGOs become more strategically and structurally embedded in the neoliberal order, and their own governing of CSOs such as the countryâ��s strong social movements.Â  It is contended that this is particularly dangerous given the vast developmental challenges facing South Africa and the deeply felt betrayal of freedomâ��s promises by the majority population.",899749978,,Dissertations & Theses," Mueller-Hirth, NataschaMueller-HirthNataschaMueller-Hirth, Natascha", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491302811 , 65065361 , 101309 , U513228 , U513228", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899749978?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0630 Public policy, Public policy," (UMI)AAIU513228 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Freedom+betrayed%3A+ngos+and+the+challenges+of+neoliberal+development+in+the+post-apartheid+era&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mueller-Hirth%2C+Natascha&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Autopia: space, movement and identity in the french road film since 1968","This thesis argues that, in the years since 1968, the road film has played a significant part in French cinematic culture. Against much criticism which has tended to view the road film merely as an imported American genre, I argue for its specificity and pertinence to this modern French context. Central to this reading is a conception of the road film as expressing what I describe as autopia. Acknowledging Foucault’s concept of the heterotopia, the autopia of the road film represents the perfected but unrealisable no-place of the utopia, and at the same time, the often dystopian movement of individual rebellion and social fragmentation. The thesis situates the road film as a particular tendency within French cinematic production; and in turn, one through which broader cultural and political concerns may be read. 1968, and more particularly its contested historical legacy, forms the core for this thesis. I argue that the autopia of the French road film is in part determined by the perceived utopian ‘failure’ of May ’68, yet a failure that we see constantly revived and re-explored in these films. My introduction locates the road film in its immediate pre- and post-’68 context, with a focus on new forms of cinematic space and identity. Chapters one and two address the place of the individual within the community, and the attendant, problematic questions of liberty and identification as filmic properties. Chapter three considers a body of road films relating to men and work, focusing on the condition of masculinity within modern capitalism; while chapter four, in response, considers the viability of a ‘feminine’ road film, looking at a new kind of road film pertinent to contemporary concerns. Chapter five takes up the concerns of chapter four to think about the role of the modern travel film, considering the situation of modern France within a transnational world.",899750755,,Dissertations & Theses," Archer, N.ArcherN.Archer, N.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491303131 , 64941321 , 101309 , U516473 , U516473", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899750755?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," (UMI)AAIU516473 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Autopia%3A+space%2C+movement+and+identity+in+the+french+road+film+since+1968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Archer%2C+N.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Being and becoming mapuche: an historical and contemporary analysis of ethnic identity in the ix region of chile,"Since the early 1990s, Latin American indigenous movements have become increasingly active, calling for national and international recognition of political, territorial and cultural rights.Â  Chile has been no exception, and the Mapuche, the largest indigenous group in this country (indeed, largest indigenous group in the Southern Cone), have publicly campaigned for these issues to be resolved since the end of Pinochetâ��s government.Â  This thesis addresses contrasting representations of what it means to be Mapuche in the public and private spheres of contemporary Chilean society, and how current social conditions enable individuals to re-define their membership to this indigenous group in increasingly variable ways.

There are indications that todayâ��s cultural climate might be favourable for a revival of the genre.Â  Madrid, a city closely involved with zarzuela since its inception, has become the musical theatre hub in Spain.Â  Since 2000, several new permanent theatres have opened in Madrid, offering productions of international musicals.Â  The growth in the supply and in the demand has brought a fresh interest in Madridâ��s traditional musical genre, zarzuela.Â  Concurrently, there has been a widespread revalorisation of zarzuela in Spain and abroad, with a growing international awareness of the genre.Â  The academic research on zarzuela has been systematised and structured by the Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales, leading to several publications, recordings and score editions. There is no consensus in the academic world about the practical feasibility of a new zarzuela.Â  Nevertheless, there are a number of approaches that may facilitate its eventual viability, adapting the contemporary zarzuela to the new social and aesthetic needs, without relinquishing the tradition.Â  As a composer, I have personally embarked on an intensive exploration of the possibilities of a genre that combines like no other the expressive and communicative strength of popular prose, poetry, folklore, music and movement. For this exploration, three steps were taken; first, researching its context; second, deconstructing the genre, and updating its language; finally, reviving zarzuela in practice.",899757698,,Dissertations & Theses," Camacho Fernandez, SergioCamacho FernandezSergioCamacho Fernandez, Sergio", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491290801 , 65061711 , 101309 , U514071 , U514071", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899757698?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," 519453 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+the+milestone%3A+beating+paths+towards+a+contemporary+zarzuela&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Camacho+Fernandez%2C+Sergio&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Gender, Christianities, and neo/liberal hegemony: An ethnographic exploration of gender discourse in a United Church women's group","This thesis explores the potential for ethico-politically committed cultural critique in investigating lived experiences of gender in the hegemonic global north, where the neo/liberal rhetoric of sexual equality tends to portray issues of gender as already sufficiently addressed. It argues that the ideological roots of dominant gender discourses can be productively explored through the interrelated histories of Christianities and neo/liberalisms that have powerfully shaped mainstream Canadian society. Supported by an extensive body of literature bringing religious studies, feminist, and queer theory to bear on sociological and political questions, this rhetoric is investigated by applying critical discourse analysis to transcripts of interviews conducted over a year of participant observation with the members of a local United Church women's discussion group. Findings suggest a complex set of attachments, rejections, and ambivalent attitudes toward those elements of feminism that have entered into the social, cultural, political and economic discourses that have become dominant in Canada. The discussion of results considers the forces which produced respondents' general complacency with the status quo of gender equality along with their hesitancy to make judgments about the validity of competing claims regarding gender ethics. Analysis concludes by examining the implication of these attitudes for the prospects of gender justice movements, especially those conceived in terms of allyship and coalition-building at the intersection of different axes of identity and practice.",1008916065,,Dissertations & Theses," Mosurinjohn, Sharday CatherineMosurinjohnCatherineShardayMosurinjohn, Sharday Catherine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2641453031 , 68636432 , 66569 , 9780494770542 , MR77054 , MR77054", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494770542, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1008916065?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Womens studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Canada , Discourse analysis , Ethnography , Gender , Neoliberalism , Protestantism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gender%2C+Christianities%2C+and+neo%2Fliberal+hegemony%3A+An+ethnographic+exploration+of+gender+discourse+in+a+United+Church+women%27s+group&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mosurinjohn%2C+Sharday+Catherine&amp;isbn=9780494770542&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The media dependence model: An analysis of the performance and structure of U.S. and global news,"This dissertation is an attempt to make sense out of the many questions surrounding news media performance and its inadequacies. Are journalists and their related professional practices to blame for the failings of news content or is it more a function of the structure in which they operate? What is the structure of today’s news media? In the digital age, does the long documented domination of official sources over sourcing tendencies found in news coverage continue to persist in mainstream news media? Further, are the criticisms of the old, traditional media still applicable for new, global-oriented news media, including in foreign languages transmitted abroad? These questions are answered by the positing of an original model of news analysis called the media dependence model (MDM). The name was chosen to emphasize the chief failing of the U.S. news media system: its reliance on corporate funding and ownership and the unfortunate result of this structure leading to a lack of independence from Washington (the White House and key Congressional leaders) and Wall Street (Madison Avenue and the public relations industry) positioning. A main pillar of the MDM is the synthesis of two critical models of news analysis and the application of their respective strengths toward the other’s weaknesses. The synthesis is based on Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky’s propaganda model (1988, 2002, 2008) and W. Lance Bennett’s indexing model (Bennett, 1990; Bennett, Lawrence, &amp; Livingston, 2007). Indexing has particular methodological strengths, while the propaganda model has more theoretical robustness. Both complement the other. While the scope of the synthesis is broad and substantial, and contributes much in terms of understanding news content, it still leaves important questions that this dissertation endeavors to address. The MDM answers how and why social movements garner news media attention and sympathy, while others do not. In several chapters, the tendencies of the news media to cover social movements in opposition to U.S. policy in a derisive fashion was illustrated through case studies on opposition movements based in Puerto Rico (Chapter 6) and Ecuador (Chapter 7). The MDM theorizes ownership of the news media in a manner appropriate for the age of globalization, with findings based on a substantial and thorough content analysis of important events in Fallujah, where the most substantial military operation was conducted during the occupation of Iraq (Chapter 4). This work does not leave domestic matters unaddressed or under-theorized. It does so by distinguishing between foreign and domestic news reporting and modeling domestic coverage, including a detailed case study on immigration which revealed dichotomized tendencies for the press to highlight certain unaccompanied minors over others (Chapter 8). A number of political communication scholars have argued that the ending of the Cold War has brought about an era of press independence, which avoids the dichotomized coverage tendencies that were characteristic of the previous era. Findings from a case study (Chapter 5) on massacres occurring in similar time periods in Acteal, Mexico and Racak, Yugoslavia, purposefully selected for its occurrence before the “war on terror,” but after the ending of the Cold War, strongly suggest that we are still not in an era of press ambiguity. Structure, as opposed to the norms and routines of professionalized journalism, is shown to be the leading variable in so far as impact on news content is concerned. A chapter documenting instances of “spiking,” the cutting of stories found to be too critical or incisive, as well as an assortment of other punitive editorial measures taken against journalists, all point to the influence of ownership and advertising as being more important than the particular practices of journalists when it comes to impact on news content (Chapter 9). In spite of containing “bird’s eye” conclusions and critical analysis on news media performance and its respective tendencies, this dissertation also addresses the conditions and instances in which exceptions are most likely to arise, with references to scholarly literature I have grouped and termed as “press exceptionalism.” Exceptional content characteristics were found, and duly evaluated in relation to the MDM, in nearly every case study undertaken in this work. The dissertation closes with an eye toward the future. In the midst of a volatile time for the journalism industry and U.S. news media, implications and future trends are taken into consideration. The “Fox effect” and the paradigm shift toward the journalism of assertion; the crisis in journalism and the critical juncture that the industry is currently undergoing; needed policies and reforms to rectify the poor state of press affairs are all considered in relation to the MDM.",1009077441,,Dissertations & Theses," Kennis, Andrew CharlesKennisCharlesAndrewKennis, Andrew Charles", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2642482391 , 65294021 , 66569 , 9781267272416 , 3503573 , 3503573", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267272416, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1009077441?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications",," 0391 Journalism , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," Journalism , Political science , Mass communications"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Chomsky, Noam , Indexing , Journalism , Media , News , Political communication , Propaganda , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+media+dependence+model%3A+An+analysis+of+the+performance+and+structure+of+U.S.+and+global+news&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kennis%2C+Andrew+Charles&amp;isbn=9781267272416&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Faceless things: South Korean gay men, Internet, and sexual citizenship","This dissertation is an investigation of the two very different pathways that the Internet was offering Korean gay men, primarily in their 30s and 40s, in terms of exercising their sexual freedom and being gay at a moment of neoliberal reforms in South Korea when an increased emphasis on individual productivity and efficiency, especially through the use of information communication technologies such as the Internet, was competing with the renewed valorization of the ideology of ""family as nation"" or ""heteronormative familism."" While the former was seen as necessary for the country to transition from a state-directed, manufacturing-based, late-developmentalist economy to a global, finance-based one, the latter was seen as necessary to reproduce the nation, particularly after the IMF Crisis, when precipitously low birth rates, declining marriage rates, and rising divorce rates have stoked widespread fears about the social and biological reproduction of the nation. One pathway, offered by Ivancity, South Korea's most popular gay portal, seemed to be offering Korean gay men with unlimited individual freedom and consumer choice to fulfill their romantic and sexual desires. Without the broader constraints of either the family or gay community, however, such interactions deteriorate into the ""chaos"" of uncontrolled individual desire. The other pathway offered by gay groups on Daum, a mainstream portal, on the other hand, seemed to be providing gay men with more limited choice and constrained individual freedom in terms of pursuing their sexual and romantic desires but also with a greater sense of social and emotional stability. Yet, even as these two groups present two very different models of Internet-mediated gay sociality and sexual freedom, neither of them can provide gay men with the kind of economic security that Koreans often derive from their biological families. Indeed, with deepening neoliberal reforms, as the family becomes the primary and often the sole source of economic security for individuals cast adrift on the turbulent waves of capitalism, single gay men from both Ivancity and gay Daum clubs – without the perceived security of their wives and children in their old age – retreat and even retire from the gay community so that they can focus on their careers and secure their economic futures. In focusing on the so-called ""first generation"" of Korean gay men who are forestalling marriage to women and using the Internet to lead their gay lives, this dissertation contributes to two main bodies of literature: (queer) globalization and Internet Studies. In terms of the first, it argues that liberal individualism that underpins globalizing notions of Westernised gay identity, movement, and culture is a contradictory phenomenon in South Korea, competing with the valorization of family as nation. In terms of the second, it argues that the Internet, as a space of autonomous individualism, promises new forms of pleasure and erotics while filtering and governing them through disciplinary norms around family, nation, consumption, and body. Together, such contradictions create a hybridized gay culture in South Korea that challenges and reworks the tropes of the ""closet"" and ""coming out"" that have traditionally defined Westernised gay culture.",1009077934,,Dissertations & Theses," Cho, Song PaeChoPaeSongCho, Song Pae", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2642472411 , 67378142 , 66569 , 9781267267313 , 3503211 , 3503211", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267267313, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1009077934?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0646 Web Studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0646 Web Studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0646 Web Studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0646 Web Studies"," Asian Studies , GLBT Studies , Web Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Asia , Citizenship , Gay , Internet , Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Faceless+things%3A+South+Korean+gay+men%2C+Internet%2C+and+sexual+citizenship&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cho%2C+Song+Pae&amp;isbn=9781267267313&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Specters of Waste in India's “Silicon Valley”: The Underside of Bangalore's Hi-Tech Economy,"The southern Indian city of Bangalore is extolled as India's ""Silicon Valley,"" emerging over the past decade as a premier site for capital flows into India's Information Technology (IT) sector. In the dominant narrative of globalization Bangalore is lauded as an aspiring ""global city"" that attracts sizeable quantities of foreign capital. Yet such triumphalist narratives of Bangalore overlook how the city also serves as a conduit through which waste (tied to capital flows and production, changing demographics and lifestyle) flows and accumulates. For instance, 6,000–8,000 tons of toxic electronic waste, or e-waste, are generated annually (mostly from the IT sector) and over 2,300 tons of municipal solid waste is generated per day in the city. This unheralded economy of waste constitutes a grim underside of Bangalore's globalized IT-led ""knowledge economy,"" to be collected, sifted and processed, with few or no safety precautions, by workers drawn from the weakest sections of the urban population—Muslim men and Dalit (outcaste) women. This dissertation posits that Bangalore's circuits of waste offer a forceful line of inquiry into questions of urban sustainability, environmental (in)justice and environmental governance. Thus, in this dissertation I interrogate the city's circuits of waste, which I take to encompass both movements of material waste as well as the labor processes that surround them. Based upon this interrogation I call into question the cultivated image of knowledge industries as socially and environmentally benign engines of growth, and document the ecological footprint of the IT industry and their routine violation of basic tenets of environmental justice. I also show how the unrecognized and underpaid labors of waste workers subsidize the environmental costs of the city's IT boom. By drawing attention to the effaced labors of waste workers, this research provokes policymakers and environmental experts to engage waste workers in an ethical discourse that recognizes their rights and claims to the city. Beyond delineating the ecological footprint of the IT sector and documenting the social injustices experienced by waste workers this dissertation shows how the category of ""waste"" operates as the material and epistemological Other of capitalism's regime of ""value,"" whose interrogation enables a grounded critique of urban commodity cultures and the historicist narratives of development that undergird them. Specifically, this dissertation shows that accumulation in the IT city is predicated upon the subsidies offered by ""disposable waste workers"" and the enclosure of ""waste"" and ""wastelands"". In short, this research is concerned with the ""hidden"" (subaltern) history of Bangalore's urban present, particularly the role that the urban poor such as waste workers and wastelands play in enabling the reproduction of the city's (knowledge) economy. By paying attention to waste this dissertation not only offers a critique of capital-centric teleologies of Bangalore's emergence as India's IT capital but also spatializes subalternity, that is, it reveals how people and places that are on the margins of the IT sector enable the center that is the IT-led knowledge economy.",1024434302,,Dissertations & Theses," Narayanareddy, RajyashreeNarayanareddyRajyashreeNarayanareddy, Rajyashree", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2707857371 , 58807761 , 66569 , 9781267416773 , 3512572 , 3512572", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267416773, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024434302?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0489 Information Technology"," 0366 Geography , 0489 Information Technology"," 0366 Geography , 0489 Information Technology",," 0366 Geography , 0489 Information Technology"," Geography , Information Technology"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Bangalore , E-waste , India , Information technology , Labor , Politics , Waste and value",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Specters+of+Waste+in+India%27s+%E2%80%9CSilicon+Valley%E2%80%9D%3A+The+Underside+of+Bangalore%27s+Hi-Tech+Economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Narayanareddy%2C+Rajyashree&amp;isbn=9781267416773&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Solidarity versus Sisterhood: Women's Issues, Feminism and Potential in Poland","Exploring the history and trajectory of women’s issues and activism in Poland, this work begins discussing the early twentieth century, moving through to the time period of the Solidarity trade union movement, continuing through the political transitions during the 1990s and ending in the present day. By examining a multitude of issues which affect women’s lives (in the quotidian and overall senses), the existence, development and necessity of women’s organizations and feminist activism in Poland becomes apparent. Labor, social, legal, and economic issues are of primary concern in contextualizing Polish women’s place in society. The introductory chapter begins by examining Polish women’s early activity in political and economic issues to provide context for their later involvement in Solidarity’s operations. The aim of the second chapter is to discuss women’s involvement with the Solidarity movement and to recognize the consequences of their subsequent exclusion from political processes during the country’s transition from communism to democracy. Focusing first on the historical context of women in Polish society through the 1990s, this work then proceeds to examine the unique case of what it means to be a woman in Poland by introducing specific issues such as the controversial abortion laws, the influence of the Catholic Church, nationalism and Polish politics in the early transitional period and periodically comparing the Polish case to that of German women. The following chapter then proceeds to examine the vast spectrum of women’s activism in Poland and the cultural difficulties in embracing the concept of feminism. Finally, the last chapter of this work details current issues, problems and potential for Polish women and concludes with an analysis of the importance of women’s activism and feminist principles of equality in society as critical to national and international measures of progress and development. The purpose of this work is to note the existing inequality between men and women, which has developed in an interesting manner in Polish society. Given the unique aspects of gender inequality in Poland this work clearly establishes a need for further scholarship and support for women’s activism. In a world which some consider post-feminist, the importance of cultivating a sense of feminist curiosity in such research is of utmost importance. Continuing to address the inequality and discrimination propagated by gender stereotypes and cultural tradition is not only a choice, but a duty for historical scholars. In the case of Poland, unique ties between the Catholic Church and Polish nationalism have created a climate in which women’s activism and feminism has been closely linked with a negative socialist legacy and has also been labeled a detrimental by-product of cultural modernism. This work sheds light on such issues in Poland, contributing to previous historiography on women in Central and Eastern Europe while providing a fresh perspective.",1140200122,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, Abigail E.MillerE.AbigailMiller, Abigail E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2809417111 , 64536991 , 66569 , 9781267693532 , 1520774 , 1520774", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267693532, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1140200122?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0453 Womens studies",," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," European history , East European Studies , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Poland",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solidarity+versus+Sisterhood%3A++Women%27s+Issues%2C+Feminism+and+Potential+in+Poland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Abigail+E.&amp;isbn=9781267693532&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Works with No Margins: Francophone Book Art in the Postcolonial Era,"This study examines works ranging from illustrated books and lyres d'artiste(s) to book-objects in order to show how book art as a genre has contributed to contemporary Francophone literatures. Adopting an approach at the intersection of aesthetic philosophy, cultural sociology and postcolonial studies, it argues that book art undermines center-periphery models of Francophone cultural production. In particular, it identifies several purposes that book art has served in the postcolonial era, namely to nurture local aesthetics, consecrate writers, commemorate trauma, build national canons, develop experimental poetics, and promote transcultural exchange. The first section is dedicated to the self-legitimizing function of book art by three post-Surrealist avant-garde movements: Cobra in Northern Europe, the Automatists in Quebec, and Aouchem in Algeria. The second focuses on its relational functions in more recent works by a variety of artists (Rachid Koraïchi, Hassan Musa, Ismaïla Manga, Ali Silem, Julius Baltazar, Jacques Clauzel), writers (Michel Butor, Salah Stétié, Denise Desautels, Hélène Dorion, Hélène Cixous, Hamid Tibouchi), and editors (Collectif Génération, Editions Al Manar, Daniel Leuwers). Finally, the third section analyzes the consecrative functions that aim to give book art social relevance by addressing postmemory of the Holocaust, book-objects inspired by Léopold Sédar Senghor's legacy, and aesthetic innovations in ""written images"" by First Nations artists in Quebec.

Implementing the contribution of Latin American thought, intellectual disability has been analysed as a modern construct that responds to four categories, medical and pedagogical, administrative and bureaucratic, moral and cultural, and a category of intimacy and mutuality. With the purpose of giving voice to the disabled individuals and their families, life stories were collected from 24 Ecuadorian families of three different ethnic backgrounds: indio , negro, and mestizo.  The process was developed through in-depth interviews with a semi-structured format, as well as participant observation as a useful technique to understand meanings of life and experiences.  Alongside the aforementioned, being loyal to the incorporation of the category of intimacy, the methodology of the research included sharing time with the families (3 days with each family) in each area of fieldwork.  The results of the research intend to contribute to the improvement of the work of the disability social movement, international organisations and the government in Ecuador are introducing approaches of conscientization and community action.  In this way, the study hopes to play a significant part in giving a voice to disabled people and their families, which will hopefully bring about new means for policies and changes in attitude.",1327106188,,Dissertations & Theses," Beatriz Miranda Galarza, H.Beatriz Miranda GalarzaH.Beatriz Miranda Galarza, H.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2945282291 , 71868952 , 101309 , U583259 , U583259", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1327106188?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy,, 0630 Public policy, Public policy," 550854 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Family+and+disability+in+Ecuador%3A+a+critical+social+and+cultural+analysis+of+the+concept+of+intellectual+disability.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Beatriz+Miranda+Galarza%2C+H.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A theology of international relations: a buddhist approach to religion and politics in an interdependent world,"For many decades, Buddhism in the West has been conceived as an ‘other-worldly’ religion with very little or –at least—limited authority in the public arena. This partial view of the Buddhist path overlooks the potential of Buddhism to interpret reality and help establish new causes and conditions to improve it. This thesis is rooted in Buddhism and seeks to develop a Buddhist theology in order to understand how international relations, as part of the contingent reality, are subject to change. Thus there is the possibility of reconstructing reality through the sum of individual will expressed in social groups, institutions and states. This Theology of International Relations follows a methodology of causality rooted in the dependent origination found in Buddhist theology. Thus, relative reality is conceived as the result of the interaction of different causes and conditions; individuals, through their thoughts and actions, provide new conditions which will be crystallized in particular social arrangements through an inter-subjective consensus. This arrangement is highly influenced by the individual’s allegiance with the sacred, however this is conceived, and thus establishes an ethical guideline in the individual’s relationship with other sentient beings and the ultimate level of existence. This dependent construction of reality goes from the individual level of analysis to the social, state, interstate and global levels in a chain of contingent reality. Therefore I suggest that states, institutions and society are the reflection of shared ideas, beliefs, goals and perceptions of reality between individuals. The human capacity to shape reality is rooted in the premise that they face a relative reality, one that is contingent on several causes and conditions. In Buddhism, all sentient beings play a key role in shaping reality but human beings play a unique role because they can overcome suffering when they recognize the interdependent relation of causes and conditions in a relative reality. If this is achieved, then absolute reality can be experienced, wherein the individual goes beyond all conceptions and senses in a state of emptiness of the self. These core ideas of a contingent reality, its construction through an inter-subjective consensus and the need to experience an absolute reality are premises which Buddhist theology developed and which this thesis explores. In chapter one this thesis considers the basis of Buddhist theology and how it explains the experience of the sacred, the role of religion and the potential for the construction of a relative reality. This thesis argues that religion is at the core of human existence as a vessel of faith which follows a particular theological path toward a communion with the divine. The Buddhist path, aware of the interaction of different levels of reality—relative and absolute—also conceives inner development and social change as key elements of an interdependent transformation. The idea of ‘world peace through inner peace’ is one advocated by ‘engaged Buddhists’ and found in the ethical code of Buddha’s message. Chapter two examines how international relations became the arena where individuals, institutions and states converge and reflect the basic premises of their world-views, whether rooted in anger, hatred and ignorance of the interdependent nature of all phenomena, or based in compassion and awareness of a shared common good. In addition, it addresses the issue of the resurgence of religion in international relations and how it is present or absent from political science theories and policy making. Through this analysis, several established elements such as the concept of the state, secularism and religion as a source of war, are challenged in a new era of multi-agency and mutual influence through religious ideas, groups and communities. Following this inter-subjective construction of the world, the thesis presents two case studies which argue that religious leaders exercise political influence through their actions, ideas and beliefs. The first is the life and works of Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama in chapter three and the second is the life of Archbishop Desmond Tutu in chapter four. The former having suffered the violent occupation of Tibet and the continuous attacks on Tibetan culture that led him into exile, and the latter having faced the policies of hatred under apartheid, the Dalai Lama and Tutu managed to suggest a world where forgiveness is rooted in compassion and were human beings share the responsibility of creating a compassionate reality. The final chapter develops a new approach to the study of religion and politics providing new variables of study and new categories to understand how international relations are influenced by religious ideas and movements. This thesis argues that there is a need to study and understand this interdependent relation between religious and secular actors through theoretical approaches in international relations and opens the discipline to new paradigms such as the Buddhist theological approach. The outcome of this partnership depends on the individual’s decision to engage, whether in negative causation that leads to violence, fear, terror and the perpetuation of suffering or in a positive one which opens the possibility of peace and liberation from suffering through compassion, forgiveness and reconciliation, recognizing our common humanity and shared universal responsibility.",1415312688,,Dissertations & Theses," Chavez-Segura, AlejandroChavez-SeguraAlejandroChavez-Segura, Alejandro", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031710341 , 74047902 , 101309 , U588591 , U588591 , http://hdl.handle.net/10023/2091", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415312688?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0318 Religion, Religion," http://hdl.handle.net/10023/2091 , (UMI)AAIU588591 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+theology+of+international+relations%3A+a+buddhist+approach+to+religion+and+politics+in+an+interdependent+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chavez-Segura%2C+Alejandro&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Apparel exportism in kenya: international regimes, chain governance and upgrading","An important question in development is how far can the contemporary global context create industrial development opportunities for the South, particularly for Low Income Countries? In an important sense, this can only be answered in non-abstract terms, since the institutional conditions facing particular industries at particular times are highly specific. In this research, a configuration of four regimes- the structural regime on production and trade in apparel, the labour regime, the neo-statist European Union regime on production and trade in apparel and the neo-statist United States regime on production and trade in apparel- creates a window of opportunity for a Kenyan export oriented apparel industry. However, we must ask whether this industry is autonomous from these regimes to the extent that its gains can be sustainably embedded within Kenya, notably in terms of product and labour upgrading, or is it, rather, subservient to them? My theoretical discussion shows that the Global Value Chain (GVC) approach presents lead firms as the primary governors in GVCs, while International Relations theory presents regimes as the primary governors in issue areas. The discussion gives a Dependency interpretation of regimes, subsuming the GVC approach in that interpretation, and arguing that, as far as issue areas are concerned, 'external' control-emergent regime governance of the GVC overrides 'internal' control lead firm governance. My empirical discussion shows that the upgrading of the Kenyan apparel industry has been insignificant, and that the governance of regimes on production and trade in apparel, while not a necessary condition, was a sufficient condition to undermine it. Nonetheless, the Kenyan Government and social movements can exploit systemic weaknesses, the former by negotiating for a single transformation of fabric and promoting export of folklore/ hand loomed/handmade products, the latter by demanding for the full implementation of minimum labour conditions.",1442485784,,Dissertations & Theses," Kindiki, M.

This thesis places the progression of the Association in Kerry into the wider national history of the GAA.  It will also chart the evolution of the local GAA there in the international context of the Victorian Sports Revolution. The grassroots membership of the Kerry GAA and their social and political backgrounds will be investigated.  likewise, the local Association’s links with the cultural and revolutionary movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Ireland will be examined.  The influence of movements and organisations such as the Gaelic Revival, the Gaelic League and Sinn Féin on the county’s GAA and its members will be assessed.  The rise to power of Kerry, as the most dominant county in Gaelic football and the effect this had on the sport nationally will be discussed.  How this success in turn shaped Kerry’s society and its sense of community will be highlighted.  The role of the county’s GAA in events such as the 1916 Rising, the Anglo-Irish War and Civil War will be considered.  This thesis will shed light on how such political splits in society at large manifested themselves on the field of play and in the local club or county board meetings within the Association in Kerry.  The effects of such political violence on the Kerry GAA and its ability to function as a sporting body in a time of war will also be measured.",1442488803,,Dissertations & Theses," McElligott, R.McElligottR.McElligott, R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101156441 , 74048222 , 101309 , U594769 , U594769", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442488803?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," (UMI)AAIU594769 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Forging+a+kingdom%3A+the+establishment+and+development+of+the+Gaelic+Athletic+Association+in+Kerry%2C+1884-1924.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McElligott%2C+R.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Becoming goth: geographies of an (un)popular culture,"Within this thesis I explore what can be achieved when culture is critically assessed through a series of theories that mobilise a spatial imaginary. I place the concepts of atmosphere, connection, site and encounter, and theories of emergence via terms such as movement, practice and embodiment, into tension with a single case study: Goth. Goth is a music based grouping, emerging from Punk, New Romantic, Indie and Glam Rock style and music cultures in the late 1970s, with a significant near-global presence in the popular culture industries and links to several salient media controversies; including the Columbine High School massacre, the murder of Sophie Lancaster, and fears over self-harm and suicide. I specifically draw on the vocabularies from within non-representational geographies of performance, relational materiality, affect and social anxiety to re-work understandings of this collectivity. I question what is involved in the material practices of Goth, explore how the practice and experience of Goth is articulated through specific sites, examine how Goth participates in the production and circulation of cultures of anxiety or (un)popularity; and reconsider the concept of ‘subculture’. To do so, I employ a range of methodologies, from guided walks to photo-diaries, within multi-site field research throughout the UK, Tokyo and New York City. I conclude that Goth and culture more generally can be theorised in a number of ways: it emerges as a performed series of embodied acts; it is co-produced in complex relations with non-humans; it can be thought of as a series of modulating affective atmospheres; it coalesces as a collectivity and circulates through events; and it is co-produced through sites and media events. None of these dominates over or diminishes the other; rather they are co-constitutive and interdependent.",1442492117,,Dissertations & Theses," Enstone, Zoe O.EnstoneO.ZoeEnstone, Zoe O.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101190541 , 73437162 , 101309 , U599601 , U599601 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:13715ee9-d01d-4671-a8d1-0dd08bd616e5", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442492117?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:13715ee9-d01d-4671-a8d1-0dd08bd616e5 , (UMI)AAIU599601 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Becoming+goth%3A+geographies+of+an+%28un%29popular+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Enstone%2C+Zoe+O.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The impact of globalisation on workers' rights in export processing zones (epzs): the case of the trade union movement in bangladesh,"The research aimed to investigate the impact of globalisation on workers' rights in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) with reference to the trade union movement in Bangladesh. Trade unions were banned in Bangladesh's EPZs until 2004. Caught by international pressures such as the United States, the ILO and local grassroots mobilisation, the government of Bangladesh passed the 'EPZ Workers' Association and Industrial Relations Act 2004' in July. The Act permitted workers to form trade unions termed locally as ""Sramik Sangha"" in Bangladesh's EPZs. This research asks what role does ""Sramik Sangha"", as a trade union representing Bangladesh's EPZ workers; play in overcoming precarious employment conditions? Different types of participants, such as officials of the relevant state agencies, employers' associations, trade union federations, EPZ plant level union representatives, senior EPZ enterprise officials and workers, were involved in this research. These trade unions have helped to achieve some positive results in a number of key areas of workers' rights. For example the trade unions have been able to implement new minimum wage rates, sometimes as a result of labour disputes. However the disputes are in no way always successful and the trade unions are associated with various adversities, fears, risks, harassment and repression during the conflict stage. The research revealed that tight bureaucratic control of the state agents over the EPZ unions imposes some limitations on the independent democratic functions of the unions and presents particular challenges to their traditional organising model. The state agent Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority ( BEPZA) has the power to affect trade unions through cancellation of registration of a trade union on account of severe contravention of any of the provisions of the Act of 2004. Thus there is a call from workers and union leaders for complete waiving of bureaucratic control clauses from the ""EPZ Workers' Association and Industrial relations Act 2004"" and for recognition of full democratic power for the EPZ trade unions by the government. However, it seems a far reaching goal since employers do not normally want to see strong unions in their enterprise. The research reveals grounds for some optimism. Despite the enormous difficulties that still lie ahead, EPZ trade unions can transform into full democratic trade unions. The process of restructuring trade unions is by no means an easy job. The research concludes by arguing that advocacy from global economic, political, social and other supranational forces such as the International Labour Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, the Organisation of European Community Development, local NGOs and Trade Union Federations could be of vital importance. Future research work focusing upon global solidarity could also make a significant contribution to the field.",1442497412,,Dissertations & Theses," Ali, Md AkbarAliAkbarMdAli, Md Akbar", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101232621 , 82333142 , 101309 , U597156 , U597156", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442497412?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," 569200 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+globalisation+on+workers%27+rights+in+export+processing+zones+%28epzs%29%3A+the+case+of+the+trade+union+movement+in+bangladesh&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ali%2C+Md+Akbar&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Selling what people need: how the modern broadway musical capitalized on economic, social and political change","This project investigates how the American musical reflected and engaged with key economic, social and political events and trends in order to sustain itself as a profitable, commercial form, from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s. Beginning with an examination of West Side Story (1957) as a reaction to a changing post-war American society and an entertainment industry in transition, this project positions the musical as an enduring form of popular culture which found continual success by embedding itself in the conditions of its production. The Civil Rights movement, Vietnam War, feminism and globalization are just some of the issues and events which the Broadway musical engaged with to create emotional moments for audiences to experience. This project explores the complexities of these relationships between the musical and its social and political context, to suggest it was by pursuing and navigating the events and issues dominating the United States in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that the musical was able to maintain its commerciality, continuing to be manufactured for consumption today. Drawing on analysis of songs, libretti, media coverage and advertising, each chapter in this thesis contextualizes a set of landmark musicals within a particular social or political issue to ask how authors, producers and audiences sustained this commercial form. It will conclude with a discussion of the British invasion of Broadway, in particular of the last major musical of the invasion period, Miss Saigon (1991). With its opening and immediate success, the making and marketing of the Broadway musical had clearly shifted into being a global rather than exclusively American commercial venture.",1564430226,,Dissertations & Theses," MacDonald, Laura EmilyMacDonaldEmilyLauraMacDonald, Laura Emily", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3441117221 , 90565062 , 101309 , U579541 , U579541 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1222", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564430226?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1222 , 554329 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Selling+what+people+need%3A+how+the+modern+broadway+musical+capitalized+on+economic%2C+social+and+political+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MacDonald%2C+Laura+Emily&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Labour relations in cyprus: employment, trade unionism and class composition","This thesis is a study of contemporary labour relations in Cyprus and is based on seven case studies: three from the hotel, two from the banking and two from the construction industries. The case studies involved particular medium and large size firms and focused on specific workplaces but some generalisations and projections are also made concerning broader tendencies in the corresponding sectors. Labour relations are approached holistically, examining both the context and the content of labour power utilisation as well as its broader impact and significance on society as a whole. The thesis focuses on employment practices and work organisation but also includes within its analytic frame, the institutional and political factors involved, management and trade unionism. The workplace is approached as a site of power relations whereby social identities and divisions occur and authority is both established and contested. Thus labour and trade union organisation is examined at the workplace level and analysed from the workers' perspective, taking into account the experience of hierarchies and resistance, and the experience of cooperation and conflict. The study is located in a nationally specific context, situating the contemporary state of labour relations in Cyprus in the historical course of development and local particular conditions of the island. The colonial legacy, the ethnic conflict and the division of the country and the rapidity of modernisation have impacted substantially on both the industrial relations and the class structure of the society. On the other hand, international forces, trends and phenomena in the era of globalisation such as flexibility in and the deregulation of the labour market, increased capital and labour flows, neo-liberal discourses and trade union decline constitute the broader coordinates of the labour process. These facts and schemata are both examined in the light of empirical data from Cyprus and used to explore and explain issues of contemporary labour organisation and class composition. Theoretically and politically the thesis is situated within a general Marxian framework that is informed both by the conflict school of industrial relations and the tradition of class composition studies. Workers' resistance and class conflict, the means through which class is being composed, is seen not only as a political by-product of the labour process but ontologically at its centre and conceptually at its heart. Thus the thesis also includes references to and can be used in broader discussions in and of the Left and concludes with a characterisation of the challenges and the prospects of the labour and trade union movement in Cyprus.",1564431712,,Dissertations & Theses," Ioannou, GregorisIoannouGregorisIoannou, Gregoris", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3441128311 , 90565862 , 101309 , U582505 , U582505 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/47187/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564431712?accountid=14496, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0624 Occupational psychology, Occupational psychology," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/47187/ , (UMI)AAIU582505 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Labour+relations+in+cyprus%3A+employment%2C+trade+unionism+and+class+composition&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ioannou%2C+Gregoris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The strange dance: ""9 Evenings: Theatre &amp;amp; Engineering"" as creative collaboration","This dissertation examines the historical case study of 9 Evenings: Theatre &amp; Engineering , a 1966 series of technology-based performances created collaboratively by avant-garde artists and Bell Labs engineers in New York City. The 9 Evenings project, part of the 1960s Art &amp; Technology movement, was a well-documented attempt to bridge C.P. Snow’s iconic “Two Cultures” of science and art. It inspired the formation of an international networked organization of artists collaborating with engineers called Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.). Both the 9 Evenings artists and engineers were influenced by Cybernetics and other new ideas emerging from 20 th century science, and they saw the value of experimenting with new communications technologies as part of their respective collaborative practices. I argue that the 9 Evenings project helped pioneer creative collaboration as a key aspect of today’s digital culture that to date has not been sufficiently examined. I also argue that technology had, and increasingly has significant roles to play in the creative collaboration process, including as translator, or “boundary object” in an emerging “collaboration aesthetic” that foregrounds dialogic processes and new knowledge rather than creating art objects. There is a review of a large body of historical and contemporary literature about mid-twentieth century art that includes original documents written by the 9 Evenings artists and engineers. There is an examination of recent writings about creative collaboration by business experts, social scientists, and arts scholars. Through case study methodology and research design, the artists’ and engineers’ first-hand accounts are applied to a matrix of successful creative collaboration elements and to technology’s identified roles in collaboration. I conclude that as creative collaboration, the 9 Evenings project was both revolutionary and transformational. It was revolutionary for its intentional focus on dialogic processes utilizing technology as both tools and boundary objects to generate new knowledge, and it was transformational emotionally, intellectually and professionally for many, if not all of the artists and engineers.

The focus of the study was on probing the views and the discursive practices of first year students, their EFL teachers, and disciplinary teachers in relation to academic writing. The aim of the study was to gain an insight into students' experience with the demands of academic writing in the college and the contextual factors that shaped this experience. Recent research has taken a social view to academic writing. Within this movement and theorising writing as a social practice, the present study adopts the academic literacies approach as the general framework for exploring students' experience with writing. The data for the study comes from three main sources: (a) semi-structured interviews with teachers, (b) student focus group interviews, and (c) document analysis. Seven focus group interviews were conducted with first year students. Fifteen interviews were conducted with teachers in the English Language Department, the Communication Department, and the International Business Department. In addition, the Head of the English Language Department in the college and the Director of the English Language Programme at the Ministry of Higher Education were also interviewed. The results suggested that first year students' writing in the context of the study is influenced by several factors that interact together to make students' writing experience a unique and contextually situated phenomenon. These factors are: a) the task requirements, b) the students' learning histories, c) the disciplinary context, and d) the institutional context. Within each of these broad categories, there are also sub-categories that further demonstrate the complexity of students' writing and the multitude of elements that shape students' writing in the college. The thesis concludes by presenting practical and theoretical implications for first year officials, teachers, and course designers based on the findings of the study.",1685877828,,Dissertations & Theses," Al-Badwawi, Halima Saleh QasimAl-BadwawiSaleh QasimHalimaAl-Badwawi, Halima Saleh Qasim", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3704702741 , 96554742 , 101309 , U637700 , U637700 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2390/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685877828?accountid=14496," 0279 Language arts , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0279 Language arts , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0279 Language arts , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0279 Language arts , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," Language arts , English as a Second Language , Rhetoric"," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2390/ , (UMI)AAIU637700 , Language, literature and linguistics , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+perceptions+and+practices+of+first+year+students%27+academic+writing+at+the+Colleges+of+Applied+Sciences+in+Oman&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al-Badwawi%2C+Halima+Saleh+Qasim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Museums without walls: the museology of georges henri riviere,"This thesis explores important aspects of the debates and practices that since the First World War have both extended the meaning of museums and museology, and renovated what was seen by many as a stagnated 19th century model of museum policy and communication. For the purpose of illustrating the manifold nature of these debates this thesis examines the life and work of French museologist and innovator of modern French ethnographical practice, Georges Henri Rivière (1897 – 1985). It draws on the conceptual distinction made in some international museum literature between museology and museums. This distinction stems from the different assumptions introduced by two long term projects of cultural development: the 18th century projects of enlightenment and the 20th century promotion of an anthropological conception of culture. The former is closely related to the European system of fine art understood as a system of promotion and popularization of the arts. The latter is part of the efforts of the human and social sciences to insert museums in the society they serve and/or to give a democratic representation to the variety of cultures existing in a society at large. The consequence was the development, in the course of the 20th Century, of two often opposing managerial policies and cultures, one inwards looking, aiming at modernization and professionalization of internal museum functions, the other focusing on closing the relationship of museology and its natural and social environment. The first was essentially administrative and scholar-based, and has thrived with the adoption of a culture of mass consumption and multiplied its functions according to an ever-dominant division of labour. The second is proactive and externally driven, a policy and managerial culture aiming at the management of processes and resources, and at the identifications and development of the living cultures existing in a society. In this line of thought this research explores the museology of Rivet-Rivière’s Musée-Laboratoire as part of a national project of cultural development aiming at changing the relationship of French citizens to their material culture and heritage. As the museological embodiment of the myth of primitivism, Rivet-Rivière’s ‘structural museology’ was shaped by the convergence of avant-garde movements in contemporary arts with the object-based ethnology of Marcel Mauss. It eventually led not only to Rivière’s most famous concept, the Ecomusée, but also to a ‘museology without walls’ and to the diversification and multiplication of local museological practices by which every activity existing in a territory could be given museographical expression. As cultural activist, Rivière was at the crossroads of major events and personalities of his time, and his museological talent was placed at the service of their concerns and expectations, particularly through his long involvement with the UNESCO-linked International Council of Museums (ICOM). Furthermore, his privileged positions in the culture of its time made him a significant witness, not just of the debate about museums, but of 20th century French cultural life.",1687700774,,Dissertations & Theses," de la Rocha Mille, Raymondde la Rocha MilleRaymondde la Rocha Mille, Raymond", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713028771 , 96791102 , 101309 , U638326 , U638326 , http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/2154/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687700774?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/2154/ , (UMI)AAIU638326 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Museums+without+walls%3A+the+museology+of+georges+henri+riviere&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=de+la+Rocha+Mille%2C+Raymond&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Between cold war and colonial wars: the making of west german policy towards the portuguese dictatorship, 1968-1974","This thesis analyses the making of West German policy towards the Portuguese dictatorship during the governments led by Willy Brandt and Marcelo Caetano, from 1968 until the dictatorship’s downfall on 25 April 1974. This case study sheds new light on the interaction between the Cold War and colonial politics, particularly on the multilateral dimension of the process of Portuguese resistance to decolonisation. Although the starting point is the bilateral relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and Portugal, this thesis takes a multifaceted approach to the topic. It examines the role of various external and internal forces pushing for change and continuity in Bonn’s policy towards Lisbon. Research demonstrates that not only did that policy become a contentious issue internationally, it also polarised West Germany’s society, parliament and different sections of Bonn’s social-liberal coalition government. Taking this into account, my work covers the diplomatic, economic and military areas of the relations between the two states. It also addresses the parallel ties between the German Social-Democratic Party and the opposition to the dictatorship, including the Portuguese socialists and the African liberation movements. The thesis argues that, despite many impulses and pressures to assertively confront the Portuguese dictatorship’s refusal to decolonise and democratise, West German policy towards the Caetano regime remained essentially cooperative, even if becoming increasingly ambiguous over time. That option reflected the geopolitical and conceptual contradictions between adopting a more aggressive policy towards Portugal and defending Bonn’s contemporary policy of rapprochement with Eastern Europe (neue Ostpolitik). Thus this thesis illustrates the interconnectedness between the global Cold War framework and the perpetuation of colonialism in Africa.",1687702739,,Dissertations & Theses," Lopes, Rui Miguel Ponte VieiraLopesMiguel Ponte VieiraRuiLopes, Rui Miguel Ponte Vieira", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713027011 , 90007532 , 101309 , U638092 , U638092 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/359/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687702739?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0601 International Relations"," 0335 European history , 0601 International Relations"," 0335 European history , 0601 International Relations", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0335 European history , 0601 International Relations"," European history , International Relations"," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/359/ , (UMI)AAIU638092 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+cold+war+and+colonial+wars%3A+the+making+of+west+german+policy+towards+the+portuguese+dictatorship%2C+1968-1974&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lopes%2C+Rui+Miguel+Ponte+Vieira&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Harda mandi: experiencing change in an agricultural market in central india (1980-2010),"Mandis or primary agricultural markets are old and ubiquitous institutions across many parts of the Indian economic landscape. Wherever they have formed, they tend to be dense sites of economic and political activity, connecting town and countryside, and local agricultural markets with larger circuits of commerce and consumption. Mandis are the most important site for the regulation of the critical ""first transaction"" between farmers and the buyers of their produce, vital points of interaction in complex and intricately intermediated markets for a range of agricultural commodities. Widely portrayed and perceived as entrenched, inefficient and unchanging, the last decade has seen growing calls for the dismantling of the mandi system as the key to the liberalisation and growth of Indian agriculture. Drawing on eighteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, this thesis centres on the everyday life, life histories, and relationships of Harda mandi, an agricultural market in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It discovers a dynamic marketplace, constantly interacting with the changing contexts of agricultural production, regional political dynamics, technological developments, processes of reform, and the penetration and contraction of different forms of agro-commercial capital. Part One follows the mandi as a shifting site of regulation over the three decades from 1980 to 2010, as major state-led interventions in agricultural production and marketing interact with local agrarian contexts and political dynamics, producing a range of effects on the mandi, its spatial dimensions, material composition, forms of intermediation, and social relations. Part Two immerses itself in the seasonal dynamics of two contrasting commodity markets – soybean and wheat – analysing the diverse and differential effects on mandi actors, processes, and market management, as global movements and domestic policies are experienced in the market yard. Stepping back, it then traces critical transitions in mandi trade over the last twenty years, describing the dominance and decline of different transactional forms, their economic consequences, and the ethical questions that they raise for local actors and more distant policymakers.",1774234806,,Dissertations & Theses," Krishnamurthy, M.KrishnamurthyM.Krishnamurthy, M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989258781 , 102697882 , 101309 , 10021826 , 10021826 , http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1333230/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774234806?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1333230/ , (UMI)AAI10021826 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Harda+mandi%3A+experiencing+change+in+an+agricultural+market+in+central+india+%281980-2010%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Krishnamurthy%2C+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Seeking the enlightened self: a sociological study of popular teachings about spiritual enlightenment,"This is a study of self and authority in the popular spiritual field. Since Heelas's The New Age Movement (1996), the notion of a common Self-spirituality in which seekers trust the authority of the Self has been familiar within academe. Yet, contrary to the direction of Heelas's earlier work on indigenous psychologies and self-religions, the different ways participants conceive terms like seeker and self has largely escaped analysis. This omission allows scholars to homogenise diverse activities and portray broad cultural trends. But, it also black boxes the self, side-lines how authority actually works, and obscures conflicts between participants. I address such gaps by examining four international enlightenment cultures, each with a guru (Andrew Cohen; Gangaji; Tony Parsons; and Steven Saunders of Holigral ). Research materials include field experiences, recorded events, and participants printed and online publications. Combining multi-site ethnography with sociological conversation and discourse analysis, and drawing upon science and technology studies throughout, my argument addresses three themes: seekers; gurus; and truths. Developing Heelas's earlier work, I show seekers are not pre-constituted but configured in interactional practices which draw upon various cultural idealisations of the self. An enlightened self is likewise configured differently in each culture. I show such mundane local practices constitute gurus as experiential experts through associating their personas with participants configured experiences of self. Different configurations of self are consequential, implying differing modes of engagement with wider society and figuring in credibility contests between different cultures. I provide a way of understanding enlightenment cultures which avoids homogenising them, considers their respective potentials to promote social change, and accounts for antagonisms between them. As tangential themes, through a literary Seeker Self voice, I address issues of distance and engagement in studying spirituality and the often transparent penetration of academic discourse by the discourse of spirituality, or its spiritual repertoire.",1779233871,,Dissertations & Theses," Abbott, KeithAbbottKeithAbbott, Keith", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013184171 , 102697862 , 101309 , 10047583 , 10047583 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/9070", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779233871?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/9070 , (UMI)AAI10047583 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Seeking+the+enlightened+self%3A+a+sociological+study+of+popular+teachings+about+spiritual+enlightenment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Abbott%2C+Keith&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Training tastes: a relationship approach to food, taste and the senses through the lens of the slow food movement","This thesis explores the ways in which taste is mobilized as a sensory, cultural, and political force in contemporary Western societies. My explorations derive from a context in which there is a growing dissatisfaction with the quality of food and this is seen as severely impacting upon social and cultural structures and institutions and as altering people’s health, habits and ways of life. This thesis investigates in what way taste and people’s sensuous engagement with food offers insight into the nature of relations between people, food, and environs. It further examines how such relations tackle the transmogrification of food and the systems supporting it, how these surpass dichotomous views of fast and slow food, and how these redefine essential dimensions of what it is that constitutes food and eating. I show that taste, rather than being a static attribute which determines people’s choices and status, is an active process of exploring, learning, and knowing. The analysis of relations between people, food and the senses is grounded in ethnographic research pursued with the Slow Food Movement in Britain. This international organization, originating in Italy, advocates that the education of taste is imperative and people need to develop and deepen their knowledge about food by eating produce which is produced, sourced, sold and prepared in sustainable and equitable ways. The thesis discusses discursive and embodied ways of engaging with food and proposes approaching the formation and training of taste in terms of patterns of perceptual experience. In highlighting food tasting as a sensory practice, I introduce the notion of sensory pageantry and evaluate several tensions and contestations around speedier and slower modalities of experiencing taste. Thus, I demonstrate that training techniques of remembering, repeating, rebalancing and fine-tuning hone taste into a skill and mode of knowing. This thesis argues that taste is relational and multi-sensuous. Methodologically, this thesis takes an interdisciplinary perspective and draws on arguments, concepts and theories from anthropology and sociology, cultural geography and ecological psychology. Furthermore, this thesis introduces storytelling as a way of ‘capturing’ the evanescent and fleeting character of taste.",1783040820,,Dissertations & Theses," Bentia, DanaBentiaDanaBentia, Dana", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4012945241 , 103020342 , 101309 , 10077136 , 10077136 , http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/74682/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1783040820?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/74682/ , (UMI)AAI10077136 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Training+tastes%3A+a+relationship+approach+to+food%2C+taste+and+the+senses+through+the+lens+of+the+slow+food+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bentia%2C+Dana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Spaces of capital/spaces of resistance: mexico and the global political economy,"Since 1994, Mexico has seen a proliferation of largely indigenous social movements asserting their right to land and territory, most notably within the southern part of the country. This thesis seeks to analyse why this has been the case by placing these movements within a theory of the production of space, and examining its role within the global political economy. It is submitted that events in southern Mexico can be explained as a clash between two distinct spatial projects; the spaces of capital on the one hand, and the spaces of resistance on the other. In order to make this argument, the inherent expansionary logic of capitalism as a mode of production is rendered, and it is detailed how the search for profit leads to constant alteration in socio-spatial relations. Using this framework, changes within the realm of production since the 1970s are investigated to reveal new socio-economic geographies, and the central role of class struggle in this process is asserted. The insertion of Latin America into global circuits of accumulation is then examined in relation to these arguments before the specific example of Mexico is turned to. Gramsci's concepts of passive revolution and hegemony are then deployed in order to analyse how spatial developments have been accomplished in Mexico though processes of state and class formation. Lastly, two regional case studies of the southern Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas are explored in light of these theoretical contentions. These states serve to highlight not only the means by which capital is currently seeking to expand accumulation, but also underline the conflicts that arise from this process as new spaces of resistance have emerged that seeks to contest and remake space in radically new ways.",1797949206,,Dissertations & Theses," Hesketh, ChrisHeskethChrisHesketh, Chris", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4094480091 , 73440282 , 101309 , U576251 , U576251 , http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/12971/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1797949206?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/12971/ , 546475 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spaces+of+capital%2Fspaces+of+resistance%3A+mexico+and+the+global+political+economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hesketh%2C+Chris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Gini coefficient of china's regional and non-parametric,"Translation from original language as provided by author With China's rapid economic growth, people's lives has undergone enormous changes, China's per capita GDP exceeded 4,000 U.S. dollars. Increase the overall level, the corresponding problems are occurring, the residents of the area of income distribution in the conflict is particularly conspicuous, China's income distribution gap has been in a ""high degree of inequality"" state, highly unequal income distribution will result in poor social the growing gap between rich, if the gap between rich and poor continues to expand, there will be a polarization, which leads to economic growth, stagnation, social unrest, political instability and other issues. Used to describe and analyze the international income distribution gap has been a lot of ways, but the Gini coefficient to quantify the direct objective of the gap between rich and poor people are widely used. For the calculation of the Gini coefficient since 1978, China's Gini coefficient domestic scholars have conducted fruitful research, made a number of valuable suggestions and ideas of measurement paradigm. However, scholars tend to be confined to rural or urban Gini coefficient of internal measurement, the overall Gini coefficient of the country relatively little research, and the method of calculation of complex and diverse, there is no uniform standard, in the calculations due to various conditions, many delay in implementation. Thus this paper, the regional economy and income distribution theory, methods of measurement of the gap between rich and poor - the Gini coefficient calculated in-depth study. Paper begins by describing the gap between rich and poor at home and abroad for Research, presented the regional division of China's economy and related advanced Western theory of income distribution, and a brief overview of China's regional and urban-rural income gap between the status quo, shows that China's wealth gap too much reality.

With the deepening of research on the resistance methods of financial crises, an informal institution based on communities in social life - the practice of alternative credit is on the rise unwittingly. A lot of cases proved that alternative credit could help communities reduce the destruction and to some extend, protect the communities from the crises. Since there is no systematic theoretical research on the relieving effects of alternative credit, this thesis tried to discuss the relieving mechanism of alternative credit, out of creative thinking, hoping to draw conclusions with practical and guiding significance. A framework consisted of ""self-governance"", ""multi-center"", ""double movement"" theories is established. Under this framework, alternative credit, regarded as an informal institution to governance community credit, which is a kind of public pond resources, was analyzed, thus two hypothesis with additive relationship were drawn and the conception of ""pedestrian refuge"" in financial crises was defined. To verify the hypothesis, this thesis adopts case analysis method. Through the analysis of alternative credit in the cases and the conclusion of its relieving effects, it is verified that the two hypothesis are right, and concluded that strong and effective alternative credit could lead to self-governance of community credit, and could realize the formation of the community center, which turn the country system into multi-center system. All the things mentioned above help communities relieve the destruction resulted from the financial crises. This process explains the trajectories of the alternative credit relieving mechanism. In order to further study alternative credit, some cases of non-strong alternative credit are also analyzed in this thesis, aiming to summarize the factors lead to its failure. After proving that alternative credit does have positive effects on the communities, the author then discuss its practical application. Beforehand we need to have two correct cognitions: (1) the effect of alternative credit is a kind of alternative mechanism instead of dominant mechanism; (2) the effect of alternative credit is a kind of constantly effect, not timely effect. To adjust measures to local condition, when talking about the concrete practical guidance, we mainly suggest three practical application patterns: to extend community currency in the poor urban communities; to establish community financial system in the not impoverished communities; finally to start using the alternative credit in the vast rural communities in order to return to its",1870242820,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, LiWangLiWang, Li", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315917931 , 111163892 , 189128 , 10545969 , 10545969", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870242820?accountid=14496, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics,, 0503 Agricultural economics, Agricultural economics," (UMI)AAI10545969 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+research+on+the+function+and+relieving+mechanism+of+alternative+credit+in+financial+crises&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Li&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Comparative study of english writing class between native english teachers and chinese teachers,"Translation from original language as provided by author Writing as a significant way to satisfy people's need of communication, can not be ""picked up"" like other language skills like listening and speaking. Writing needs constantly professional training. But in Chinese middle school, English writing has been ignored since the very beginning. Since 1970s when native English speaking teachers (NESTs) began to be introduced into China, many new teaching approaches have been brought to ESL teaching in China. This thesis compared the English writing classes respectively taught by a Chinese teacher and a Canadian teacher. This study is aimed to examine the two teachers' application of task-based language teaching, process-oriented writing approach, cooperative learning, non-verbal communication and corrective feedback. The subjects of the study were 47 students(G 9) from Maple Leaf International School. Student questionnaire has been used to investigate the quality of writing class in the eyes of students. And class observation has been carried out as a direct method to examine the difference between the two teachers. At the end of the study, final examination has been conducted to examine whether there is a significant discrepancy between the two classes. The data collected from the student questionnaire and level test was analyzed with SPSS 13.0. The result suggests that both the Chinese teacher and the Canadian teacher successfully put English learning into real life situation by applying task-based language teaching in writing class. But the Canadian teacher attached great importance to the writing process through instructing repeated revision process, while the Chinese teacher spent most of the time in explaining the useful expressions and models. The Canadian teacher also used cooperative learning in pre-writing stage and peer-editing stage, but Chinese teacher didn't. What's more, the Canadian teacher has rich face movements and body language which make the class rather relaxing and attracting. In addition, the Canadian teacher prefers to use explicit corrections, while the Chinese teacher prefers to use metal linguistic explanation. However, the result of the level test indicated that significant discrepancy could only be found in the aspects of language. The students of both classes achieved the similar score in aspects of idea, structure and grammar. Based on the result of this study, some recommendations have been made for the teaching of ESL writing in Chinese middle school. English learning should be put into real life situation, and the students are supposed to use English in and after English class. Apart from that, Cooperative learning could be widely used in writing class not only to improve the communicative function of writing but also to enhance the social skills of students. In addition, writing process should be emphasized as well as the product. Although many researches have been done to study the teaching situation of English writing in Chinese middle school, this thesis is the first comparative study of the writing classes taught respectively by a native English-speaking teacher and a non-native English-speaking",1870243023,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhao, MengZhaoMengZhao, Meng", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315955831 , 111171732 , 189128 , 10491086 , 10491086", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870243023?accountid=14496, 0290 Linguistics, 0290 Linguistics, 0290 Linguistics,, 0290 Linguistics, Linguistics," (UMI)AAI10491086 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Comparative+study+of+english+writing+class+between+native+english+teachers+and+chinese+teachers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhao%2C+Meng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The animal model of spinal cord injury,"Translation from original language as provided by author Background With the development of transportation and construction, the trend of The global incidence of spinal cord injury increasing year by year. According to recent statistics, the occurence rate of SCI in the world is 15-40 cases/million each year. Because of the ability of nerve tissue's self-repairing is limited, Disorders of nervous functions is difficult to restore after spinal cord injury nerve. Most of SCI patients left over completeness or incomplete ""four paralyzed"" or ""conservative"", who's life cannot provide by oneself,which bring huge economic burden to the family and social. Research of spinal cord injury mechanism, pathological physiology and evaluate each treatment is the only road to improve the clinical curative effect for spinal cord injury that used to animal models. The ideal of spinal cord injury animal model shall meet the following conditions: 1, Close to clinical; 2, regulation sex; 3, repeatability; 4, economic and practicalThere has reported that six kinds of model are in common usage currently such as Spinal cord contusion model/ Spinal cord compression injury model/ Spinal cord cut injury model/ Spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury model/ Spinal cord over tension injury model/Spinal cord photochemical injury model et al. Most human spinal cord injuries result from fracture and dislocation of the spinal column,they caused by transient compression or contusion of the spinal cord, the main of current research is spinal cord contusion model. But the largest problem to made these models is hard to control Accuracy, poorer repeatability. We found more than 100 kinds of spinal cord contusion impactor improved by Allen's sport in recent half a century which can made different types of spinal cord injury, but they do not adjust the Hit impulse/secondery injury made by impactor and lack of an exact record for the impact parameter which made the model low repeatability. In 1993, NIH funded the multicenter animal spinal cord injury study (MASCIS), made it overcome the old equipment. the device used digital optical potentiometers to measure the trajectory of the falling rod with a precision of ±20μm and±20μms, providing accurate (+1%) measurements of the delivered trauma.the impactor measured movement of the spinal column at the impact site, subtracting this movement from the cord movement. the device was designed to deliver three levels of injury to rat spinal cord by dropping a 10-g rod 12.5, 25.0, or 50.0 mm onto T13 spinal cord (T9-T10 bony level), respectively producing mild, moderate,and severe injury with distinct biochemical, histological, and behavioral changes. This device can be accurate measurement of the multiple biomechanics parameter, including rocking bar impact velocity, spinal cord is compressed distance, compression ratio and discarded by stress, and it could subtract animals that beyond the scope of Scheduled stressAIM : To respectively producing mild, moderate,and severe injury stability, which used with MASCIS impactor, affirmed by ASLA. METHODS: In female adult Sprague Dawley rats, after the T10 spinous process and the corresponding vertebral lamina were removed , exposed spinal cord endorhachis with the length is about 0.5 cm , 0.3 cm in diameter. deliverd three levels of injury to rat spinal cord by dropping a 10-g rod 12.5, 25.0, or 50.0 mm onto T13 spinal cord (T9-T10 bony level), In control group, rats received only T9-10 laminectomies . The behavioral scores and the pathological alterations were recorded at different time points. RESULTS: In control group, the rats could walk after reviving, and the micro-structure of spinal cord was normal; group A(12.5mm),one month after the operation, movement function is almost restored, the score of BBB is 17.34±1.00, the micro-structure of spinal cord was distinct, Glial cell hyperplasia; group B(25mm), one month after the operation, the score of BBB is 7.32±1.12,in the micro-structure of spinal cord we can see Lacunar formation, Glial cell hyperplasia, several Variation neurons; group C(50mm), one month after the operation, the score of BBB is 4.87±0.31,the residue spinal cord tissues are less than the group B. The spinal cord structure is disorder and Serious deformation,The necrosis cavity accounted for about 80% of the spinal cord. the differences between the groupA ,B,C and the normal control group was statistically significant (the P value is respectively 0.041,0.029,0.009).CONCLUSION: the models of three levers of mild, moderate,and severe injury made by MASCIS Impactor,which are Stable ,reliable and better repeatability, they can used to the Research of spinal cord injury mechanism,Pathophysiological changes and different kinds of clinical treatment selection, so as the transplantion of stem",1870245207,,Dissertations & Theses," Yang, QiYangQiYang, Qi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315923801 , 111165482 , 189128 , 10479743 , 10479743", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870245207?accountid=14496, 0564 Medicine, 0564 Medicine, 0564 Medicine,, 0564 Medicine, Medicine," (UMI)AAI10479743 , Health and environmental sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+animal+model+of+spinal+cord+injury&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yang%2C+Qi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study of environmental management on epc mode for construction project,"Translation from original language as provided by author Construction project in the provision of infrastructure and industrial facilities, increasing employment, promoting social development at the same time, also consume large amounts of natural resources and energy in the construction process, affecting natural hydrology, to the sustainable development of society have a major negative impact.

Whether this leap and can lead to discovery of deep universal law? Whether the foundation of new theory improves our ability to control the nature? The core issues of complex system: how the emergence appears in a new non-equilibrium open-structure system self-organized by the large number of subsystems? The objectives of complex system science : to generate new technologies (including new software) and the deeper understanding about the basic problems of complex system. Statistical mechanics is a theory bridge micro and macro many-body system. It can play a important role in organizing all kinds of measurement data systematically, establishing appropriate kinetic model to obtain its properties and finding the law of movement and other aspects of the system. The studies of complex networks have shown that the organizational structure in different areas can have surprisingly similarity in recent years, which suggests the common underlying in complex system. Statistical mechanics is an important way to reveal the universal law. In this paper, we study a number of critical phenomena and collective behaviors in complex systems by various means of statistical mechanics and find some interesting results. We propose a effective routing strategy on the basis of the so-called nearest neighbor search strategy by introducing a preferential delivering exponent and a waiting time exponent . We assume that the handling capacity of one vertex is proportional to its degree when the degree is smaller than a cut-off value K, and is infinite otherwise. Traffic dynamics both near and far away from the critical generating rate Rc are discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal , and . Our strategy may be useful and reasonable for the protocol designing of modern communication networks. We study the traffic dynamics in two-dimensional Biham-Middleton-Levine(BML) traffic flow model based on the irregular lattice. It is found that a phase separation phenomenon, in which the system separates into coexistence of free flow and jam, could be observed in intermediate vehicle density range. We investigate the prisoner's dilemma game based on a new rule: players will change their current strategies to opposite strategies with some probability if their neighbors' average payoffs are higher than theirs. Compared with the cases on regular lattices (RL) and Newman Watts small world network (NW), cooperation can be best enhanced on the scale-free Barabasi Albert network (BA). It is found that cooperators are dispersive on RL network, which is different from previously reported results that cooperators will form large clusters to resist the invasion of defectors. Cooperative behaviors on the BA network are discussed in detail. We generalize a majority-rule model on the opinion dynamics, where all mobile agents update their status based on Vicsek model. We find the existence of an optimal preferential rule for which the convergence to global consensus can be achieved much more rapidly than under other rules. Qualitative insights are obtained by examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the opinion clusters. The three-dimensional Vicsek model is introduced to investigate the collective motion of self-propelled particles. In this model each particle has a limited view angle. We find that there exists an optimal value of view angle, leading to the quickest direction consensus. Our work shows that the optimal view angle is just a function of the absolute velocity and the particles density in the limit of large boundary size. We present a series of special results demonstrating more fundamental and practical rules in the daily-life pragmatic collective phenomena, which is of significance to the low-cost communication. We generalize the Eden model to take into account of the screening effect, i.e., the end point grows much faster than the interior points do. Highly anisotropic clusters are obtained in our generalized Eden model. It is found that the length in the long direction scales differently than that in the short direction does as the number of site",1870455531,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Yu JianLiJianYuLi, Yu Jian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316362341 , 111140082 , 189128 , 10471433 , 10471433", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870455531?accountid=14496, 0488 Inorganic chemistry, 0488 Inorganic chemistry, 0488 Inorganic chemistry,, 0488 Inorganic chemistry, Inorganic chemistry," (UMI)AAI10471433 , Pure sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+the+dynamic+properties+of+the+collective+behaviour+and+critical+phenomenon+in+complex+system&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Yu+Jian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Multiculturalism and social instabilities in urban area: causes,consequences and issues. comparative study between united state of america and niger north area","Translation from original language as provided by author In its appearances and its contemporary manifestation, the challenges provoked by the thrust of cultural identities have up to half a century of history. Since the 60s, it unveiled the broad social fragility and the problem of coexistence between cultures in democratic countries. This challenge has shacked the dictatorial, the authoritarian regimes, in particular when it alludes to the religious organizations, or national liberation groups. And it taps well our countries, under the shape of religious, nationalist movements, either still fights which recover from what we call indigenize. Faced with this challenge, we cannot formulate summary hypotheses. We are not any more at the beginning phase made by unknowns: we are engaged deeply in conflicts, tensions and transformations which we know already are not ephemeral .It does not obviously mean that their expressions are stabilized, or that their senses are fixed to the long term. To bring knowledge and more clarity on the nature of the problems in cause and on the way they are envisage in the public debate. We suggest analyzing in what the multiculturalism is a solution of the identical crises. Produce knowledge on the cultural differences, their production, their transformation and their reproduction; examine the problems which they generate in the social life, the meanings which they dress for the interested and for others; report their difficulties and their internal tensions: all is within the competence of the sociological analysis and requires as such specific theoretical and methodological tools. To return our coherent and practical work we are going to support our reflection with a case study, at least comparative between several multiculturalists' models in particular French, American, Canadian and British. This exercise will allow us to kick away hypotheses which will be used as runway to the scientific community and to all society in the grip of the identical crises. However, the elaboration of a theoretical frame of the multiculturalists question stays a preliminary tool. As mentioned theoretical frame elaboration will serve as support of reflection .It will allow us to seize better the notion of the multiculturalism .it will include three main trunk dimensions which are: the Definition of the multiculturalism, the management of the multiculturalism and the identical tensions connected to the vertical and horizontal inheritances. According to Amnesty International multiculturalism is defined as a policy to maintain and to value the various cultures and the communities living within a society. It also implies fighting against the discriminations and promoting the whole and fair individuals participation and the communities of any origins to the social life. This definition brings to light the objectives of an ideal policy of the multiculturalism. We shall also retain of this definition which the multiculturalism can be understood under three approaches: sociological, institutional and ideological. The sociological approach is interested in the ethnic and cultural composition and interactions in the public area. It reports the facts state and the problem aroused by the intercultural relations. The institutional approach is more pragmatic, because it refers to the means of multiculturalism management: in the laws, in the policies, in the regulations, etc. The ideological approach recovers from the philosophic domain. It is the reflection which joins in reaction to the governmental policies about the multiculturalism management.Our societies receive and reproduce differences, but they invent it, including under the seal of the tradition. Each of us, in the most immediate circle of acquaintances, is confronted with the raid of new identities, even with conversions; each of us observes the development of cultural movements. Some leave indifferent, the others arouse the most diverse feelings, of understanding and sympathy or, on the contrary, fear, aversion and discharge. Some day, each of us can also notice that his own experience of a cultural sense of identity, including the most stable seemingly, is not inevitably definitive, that personal changes are always possible, susceptible to lead us up to the pure and simple renunciation of an identity, to adopt if necessary a piece of news.

Since the principles of pursuing crimes moves from private-oriented to public-oriented, the system of criminal justice has paid more attention to the protection of the suspect and the defendant and the criminal reform and education than that of victims, which turns victims gradually to be the means of controlling crimes and the rim of criminal policy concern and not until World War II has this trend reversed. With the rapid development of the movements aimed at rights for victims, the research of victimology and the strong initiation of restorative justice by the international society, the subject of the reform of criminal justice system in all countries has showed growingly a tendency to give victims more care, which provides an opportunity for us to choose this topic. In detail, what are the factors of victims in prosecutorial discretion? How to consider these factors during prosecutorial discretion?

Besides, their legislation of protecting personal information have big impact to other counties.Compared with foreign countries, because of the social ideas, information industry, science and technology and legislation programs and other reasons, our country didn't realize the importance of protecting personal information for a long time. Now, our contry have yet to formulate special personal information protection law. In this paper, it clarifies the definition of personal information in EU and US, exploring the definition of personal information. Subsequently, on this basis, it explores the personal information protection system in EU and US legislative history and the basis of law. Eu law is based largely on OECD "" Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans-border Flows of Personal Data"" and "" Personal Data Protection Directive""; American law is based largely on APEC "" Privacy Framework "", Constitution and ""Privacy Act"". In addition, using comparative analysis method, the paper deep analyzes EU and US cross-border transfer of personal information protection and executive agency to find their advantages and disadvantages so that China can learn useful experience from them. The existing protection of personal information in our country has a lot of problems, and mainly includes: Firstly, the protection of personal information is in the small scope and lack of special legislation. Secondly, related system is vacant. Finally, the civil liability is blank. In order to achieve protection of human rights, enhance information sharing and freedom of movement, promote international trade and cooperation, integrate and coordinate Regional Laws, China need to legislate ""Personal Information Protection Law"". In 2005, our country has made ""Personal Information Protection Law (expert proposal draft)"" , but it haven't yet official promulgated. Through the analysis of the expert proposal draft, its success is to pay attention to balance between the benefit relations of personal information protection and information flow, choose the EU comprehensive legislation approach and self-discipline mechanism, focus on the question when personal information cross-border transport, and establish independent executing agency, etc. However, it has also some shortage. First, It is thick with administrative color, having inperfect civil liability system. Second, the legal base of cross-border personal information transmission is single. Thirdly, The duty of executing agency is unclear. Ultimately, learned the advanced EU and US legislation and practical experience, combining with the shortage of ""Personal Information Protection Law (expert proposal draft)"" , the paper make the following recommendations in order to perfect the legislation to protect personal information. First, perfect the civil liability system to protect personal information. Second, further define the duty of executing agency.

Our legal system of labor union emphasized the political value, the economic value and the social value. Because of national and international labor union movement in practice and the spread of the foreign theory, our nation has to take action on legislation on labor union. The legislation towards labor union in the Republic of China can be traced back to three different stages. From 1912 to 1924 is the primitive stage where certain laws governing this aspect have been made from non-existing to reality; the labor union Ordinance of 1912 firstly sets the organizing qualifications and approving procedure systematically, as well as the role of the union, its members, staff, fees and protection measures of the assets of it, forming the regulation of union for the first time; the amended version of the Labor Union ordinance expanded the scale of its membership, enlarged its rights and obligations, it also fortified the protection of the union's assets by improving the fees. From 1925 to 1942 China saws the developmental stage of this aspect of legislation. In this period, China achieved regulation through the formal state legislation with effort. Law of the Labor Union of 1929 was a milestone marking a historical period of the legislation which raised the standard of the establishment of Labor Union. It posed restriction of the signing right and the right of going on a strike. It also covered the terms of prohibition toward it staffs, members as well as the union itself. It also expanded the powers of the respective administrative organs. It can be clearly seen from this a shift of the legislation from empowerment of the union to restriction of it. From 1943 to 1949, the law had entered a fluctuating period, with 3 versions in just three short years, reflecting the urgent demand of the Nanking government to facilitate the development of the labor union. At this time, the legislation tended to be more sophisticated and detailed, increasing the regulations on General union and federations. In the Republic of China, the Legal System of Labor Union's most important content is the right of association, the right of collective agreement and the right of strike. This article will pay more attention on those three rights. The right of association is the basis for all labor union's activities. The right of collective agreement is an important way to protect the rights of workers. The right of strike is also important means to make the rights of workers respected. In the Republic of China, the legal purpose of Labor Union is diversity. Legislative and judicial practice showed differences.

In recent years, the flourishing of environmental and animal protection movement, make more and more people begin to focus on the relationship between people and animals. Now, use legal force to protect animals, have reached a consensus. In nature, the ecological status of wildlife and ecological function is extremely important, even indispensable. The protection of their career development is used to measure the world's scientific and cultural and spiritual development of an important indication of the degree, and is an international cultural exchange and mutual concern people is an important content of man and animals, and maintain harmony, it is an important part of society construction. Legal protection of human values and determine the human wildlife conservation efforts. However, human hunting of wild animals, indiscriminate poaching, wanton destruction of the ecological environment, so the loss of wildlife habitat on their survival of the enormous pressure, more seriously, some of them have been endangered or even extinct species. China's vast, natural environment is complicated, variety of wild animals. According to statistics, in our country there are about 6266 kinds of vertebrates, at least roughly 10% of the world. Since the founding of new China, although we put on the protection of wildlife resources and ecological environment improvement as a basic state policy of population quantity, but because of the soaring number of our population, the rapid development of economy, the demand for wild animals and the pressure also will continue to increase. Among the many factors, in the wild animal species, many endangered, survival situation seriously unsettling. In our country, worrying not only the wildlife protection, people are also worried about the animal husbandry. At present, our country's predators is the world's average level of the super speed rapid development. China will become the meat production. But behind the sacrifice is immeasurable, high-volume production of breeding animals, animal welfare and living conditions, and enter the animal health problems have become more and more obvious. Abroad, animal protection legislation has to traverse more than two hundred years passing by, and China is like a newborn baby in this field. The legislative system is not perfect, operability is very low, with great limitations, especially on injury and abandonment of abuse and bad behavior does not make penalties.

More and more countries and regions are now joining in for the absolute abolition of death penalty. In China, the abolition movement for death penalty is gaining great progress. The history of abolishing death penalty abroad and the measures to substitute death penalty have brought us to know that: in the process of establishing and implementing the measures to substitute death penalty, the respective historical culture and tradition have also played important roles in exception to the particular political, economical and social development. Thus, it is increasingly important to further boost the death penalty reform in China and strictly limit the number of immediate execution of death penalty. It is also extremely urgent and essential to learn from the practices abroad based on China's particular situation and construct a reasonable death penalty alternative measure system in China.This paper systematically deals with the measures to substitute death penalty. It has gone through the different opinions held by China theoretical world towards death penalty alternative measures and studied the successful practice applied abroad. With the current development of the capital sentence reform in China, this paper makes a research on the nature, concept and classification of death penalty alternative measures and puts forward proposals two measures to substitute capital sentence: suspension of death penalty execution and life sentence. The aim is to find a solution to restrict the number of immediate execution of death penalty and move further to abolish death penalty. The main body of the paper can be divided into the following parts:The first part elaborates on the nature, concept, classification and meaning of death penalty alternative measures. It analyzes at depth the death penalty alternative measures. After comparing the various opinions, this paper holds that the death penalty alternative measures are in essence legislative as well as judicial. Death penalty alternative measure refers to the punishment that is used in jurisdiction for the crime which should have been immediately executed by death penalty when all the judicial conditions are met. Death penalty alternative measures are based on crime policies and principal of suiting punishment to crime in the aim of restricting immediate execution of death penalty. While introducing the traditional classification of the death penalty alternative measures, this paper also makes probes into the classification of the execution of death penalty alternative measures and gives a thorough elaboration of the significance of the death penalty alternative measures.The second part, According to different stages in the process of death penalty repeal in different countries, all countries and regions in the world are divided into four categories based on the experience of foreign death penalty alternative measures: first, countries and regions completely abolished the death penalty, represented by Britain and Germany. Second, countries and regions practically abolished the death penalty, represented in South Korea. Third, countries and regions keep but strictly restrict on the death penalty, represented by Japan, the United States. Fourth, countries and regions need to restrict the death penalty. This paper focuses on introduction and analysis of death penalty alternative measures in the first three relatively typical countries, in order to achieve the death penalty alternative measures suitable for China's national conditions.The third part, key of the paper, established the death penalty alternative measure based primarily on our specific national conditions and the will of the people. All the expedition, analysis and research to the alternative measures about the death penalty, will ultimately be implemented on our practice in China to provide reasonable scheme for further restrictions and abolition of the death penalty. In this paper, one death penalty alternative measure, lifelong confinement without sentence reduction or parole provisional release are constructed, so as to further promote death penalty reform and provide useful references for restrictions and even abolition of the death penalty",1874538979,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, ChaoWuChaoWu, Chao", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318956161 , 70614212 , 189128 , 10500879 , 10500879", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874538979?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10500879 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+alternative+measures+to+the+death+penalty+in+our+country&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Chao&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on evaluation of industrial competitiveness and upgrading measures of wuhan city,"Translation from original language as provided by author Advanced industry makes a strong city! As the cradle of our country's modern industry, Wuhan City gave birth to the well-known ""mauserm1888 rifle"" during westernization movement of China; in the early Reform and Open up, the industrial net output value of Wuhan City stably ranked the 4th place in China. Brilliant achievements of Wuhan before depends on the powerful and prosperous industry. Currently, our country is still in the process of industrialization and urbanization at full speed. A city's industrial position of strength affect, to some extent determine its economic position and development prospects. Wuhan must carry out the strategy of Industrial Powerful City and Double Industrial Output Plan firmly. Taking Wuhan industrial competitiveness as the research object, the Wuhan industry in economic society macro perspective of qualitative analysis research, and through the historical investigation of longitudinal and transverse industry comparison investigation of longitudinal and transverse industry comparison, we can draw a conclusion that Wuhan industrial economy is the basis of economy. At the same time, in order to assess Wuhan industrial competitiveness scientifically and reasonably, this paper referring domestic and international competitiveness evaluation model based on, has set up a new evaluation of industrial competitiveness model.

Students respond to commands that require physical movement. TPR has the feature of teaching through lively activities, and can arouse students' interests and motivation of learning a new language. It accords with children's mental characteristics, so it has been wildly used in kindergartens and elementary schools in China and the result is quite satisfying. Thus, as for the international elementary school students who study Chinese as a second language, and who are beginners in learning Chinese characters, can we apply some of the ideas of TPR to the teaching process, therefore improve the teaching results? In order to answer this question, we have studied international elementary school students who are from Europe and U.S, and who have never learned any Chinese characters, and we will discuss the topic of using some of the ideas of TPR to improve their Chinese characters learning. We first overview the situation of study in Chinese characters teaching as a foreign language and as a native language. We discuss some of the problems and flaws in those studies. Then considering the cognition characteristic of international elementary school students who are from Europe and U.S, we designed a psychological experiment in oder to measure the effects of applying some of the ideas of TPR to Chinese characters learning in the initial stage. The subjects are 40 elementary school students in China, who are from Europe and U.S. Their native languages are all English and their average ages are about 7. The subjects are divided into 2 groups: one experimental group and one control group. During the experiment, the experimenter teaches the subjects in the experimental group ten Chinese characters using TPR, while the control group without the help of TPR. After the teaching process, with the help of the psychological test software, we give both group a test, and record the subjets' reaction time (RT) and accuracy. After the test, we carry out a statistical analysis of the records we get from the test, with the help of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), and discuss the results of statistical analysis. Based on the experimental research results, there are two conclusions: By applying the ideas of TPR to Chinese characters teaching as a foreign language in the initial stage in elementary schools, the results of teaching and learning can be improved obviously. Sex difference does not have a distinct influence on the effects of using the ideas of TPR in Chinese characters teaching as a foreign language in the initial stage. That is to say, both boy students' and girl students' learning results have improved distinctly while using the ideas of TPR. Based on the experimental study conclusions, we further discuss the appliance of the ideas of TPR in teaching Chinese characters as a foreign language in the initial stage. First teachers should follow students' basic cognitive disciplines; firmly establish the perception of Chinese character component in their minds; and control the number of characters they teach during each class. As for the basic rules, teachers should follow the rule of physical response, happy learning, creating environment, whole instruction, progressive resistance, and encouragement. As for the teaching steps, teachers can follow such steps as: showing---explaining---consolidation---feedback---using. There are several basic ways of TPR teaching, and students can learn new Chinese characters with the help of action and expression, of pictures and cards, and of real objects. There are also several activities such as jumping game, dice game, knocking game, singing songs and role play that will be useful ways of teaching. To sum up, this research study proves that the ideas of TPR can improve the effects of Chinese characters teaching as a foreign language in the initial stage in elementary schools. We also hope this research study will provide new ideas and perspectives to teachers who teach Chinese as a foreign",1874564584,,Dissertations & Theses," Feng, You MingFengMingYouFeng, You Ming", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319001041 , 111167892 , 189128 , 10550114 , 10550114", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874564584?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10550114 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+the+total+physical+response+in+children%27s+chinese+character+acquisition+in+the+initial+stage+based+on+experiments&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feng%2C+You+Ming&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The choices of denmark and ireland for european integration: the view of liberal- intergovernmentalism and post-functionlism,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since the end of WW II, regional integrations have begun to spring up all around the world, which rises a question that where nation-states going in the trend of integration. Opinions are widely divided in academic world. Some scholars see the issue from a functionalist view and believe that international regional organization could replace nation-states by functioning better governance, whereas other scholars point out nation-state is still full of vigor because of national identity works, which based on a post-materialism theory. Moreover, this kind of debate is also existed in theories of integration. One can find the dispute borderline between 'Economic Cost-benefit' analyze and 'post-material identity' interpretation when studying the Choices of nation-states in an integration. As the most highly integrated regional organization, European Union is an important integration research object. It is well know that there are gapping differences among EU member states, so here need specific case study rather than discuss theory generally. This article is based on experience research, specifically, the case study of Denmark and Ireland in European Union, conducting a historical comparative analysis, as well as using integration theories as the norms of research agenda. On one hand, the article can further discuss European study and integration theories through this experience research. On the other hand, it is also valuable to study the history of Denmark and Ireland participating in European integration. The research takes the treaty of Maastricht as a midpoint, dividing the model of Denmark and Ireland participating in European Integration into two stages. By the historical analyze to the domestic debates and referendums about treaties of European integration in Denmark and Ireland, the article finds some discoveries as follows: In the 1970s and 1980s, the choices of case countries were mainly based on economic benefits, the identity and geopolitics only had marginal effect, the political elites and interest groups could made the choices solely. In this stage, the influence of Euroscepticism was already existed in Denmark and Ireland, but failed to stop the two countries joining in European Community in 1972 and ratify the Single European Act in 1986. Because EC was basically an intergovernmental economic organization at that time, and the motivations of governments to participate in integration is mainly based on economic benefits. Interest groups, especially agricultural interest groups of Denmark and Ireland played the crucial role in the process of domestic negotiating and debate. At the same time, the normal people did not have sufficient professional economic knowledge or deep concern about the integration, so there were 'Permissive Consensus' between elites and masses. Since 1990s, although economic preference still exists, its weight has declined significantly comparing to last stage. Alternatively, People's identity has risen to affect choices of nation-states' choices greatly, accompanying with the domestic politization of European issues. In Denmark, the deepening European integration, like introducing the European Citizenship, has made the Danish concern about the Danish identity come true. The article find the typical evidence in the process from Danish deny of Treaty of Maastricht and ratify of Edinburg Agreement. While Ireland, a country once was labeled as 'Pro-European', also become more nationalistic against EU in the issue of neutrality and anti-abortion. The author point out that the Irish deny of the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon could contribute to the propaganda on Irish Identity. Furthermore, the mode of domestic negotiating is changed, from sole secret negotiating among interest groups and branches of government, to public political debates and social movements. In the conclusion, the article claims that the rise of Post-Functionalism has challenged Liberal-Intergovernmentalism, but it is still possible for a mutual complements between the two theories. Liberal-Intergovernmentalism should combine with Post-Functionalism to analyze the preference of nation-states in regional Integration, by introducing the concept of identity and politization. In the end, the author also suggests that researches on integration even international relations should understand the two different dimensions of Nation-State: 'Nation' as an identity political community of identity and 'State' as a economic function",1874889716,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhong, ZhunZhongZhunZhong, Zhun", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319235341 , 111165892 , 189128 , 10545948 , 10545948", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874889716?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10545948 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+choices+of+denmark+and+ireland+for+european+integration%3A+the+view+of+liberal-+intergovernmentalism+and+post-functionlism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhong%2C+Zhun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study on bernstein's rethink on the direction and path of socialism development,"Translation from original language as provided by author Edward Bernstein(1850-1932) is one of the most famous theorists and doers of German Social Democratic Party, world socialist and communist movements. His exploration of the direction and path of socialism development attracted huge disputes in the development of world socialism and received mixed judgments. Even today, Bernstein and his thoughts still exert important influence in the development of socialism for western countries and China as well. On the basis of various political and economic changes of capitalism world, through maintaining the scientific and present nature of Marxist and a fully revision, Bernstein made another definition for struggling methods of proletarian, pointed out the direction and path of socialism development, and tried hard to find a route suited to the reality in order to realize socialism under new circumstances. And his theories seemed to have proved themselves in many aspects in practice, reflected in several ways of reality. Therefore, an objective and correct understanding of Bernstein's theory of the direction and path of socialism is of significant reference meanings for us to see clear of current social development, adhere to Marxist and uphold the direction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. As scholars have made thorough studies on Bernstein and his revisionism in many respects and at all levels, this article should only put forward some ideas and understandings of Bernstein's theory of the direction and path of socialism development on the basis of the researches of seniors. This article based itself on Bernstein's socialism theories. Backgrounds and meaning of this study can be seen through an introduction of the important influence his theories exert on western countries and even China. The main body of this article is put forward through a conclusion of studies on Bernstein and his theories. This article mainly includes the following parts: Part 1 Research backgrounds, meaning and domestic and international studies on Bernstein nowadays Part 2 Motivation analysis of the formation of Bernstein's socialism thoughts This part discusses reasons of the formation of Bernstein's thoughts mainly through three respects: First, political and economic changes of capitalism; Second, complexity of working class structure; Third, thoughts and strategies of Engels in his late years. On this basis, this paper points out that the social situation, working class situation and relations with SPD are the objective backgrounds of Bernstein's rethinking on socialism route, and subjectively he had not intention to abandon socialism. Part 3 Discussing fundamental meanings of Bernstein's socialism thoughts In this part, this paper analyzes Bernstein's remarks and works, concludes that his thoughts are mainly showed in the following two aspects: One is the recognition of socialism. He denied the scientific nature of Marxism socialism, put forward the concept of critical socialism, and pointed out that the final understanding of socialism should be ""enhancing political democracy, establishing economic democracy, being inclusive to different outlooks on the world inside working class movement, keeping the rights of SPD in towns, states and at federal levels and participating in the government in the due time."" This illustrates that Bernstein is not only different from soviet socialist, but also different from Marxism theories. The other aspect is the recognition of route leading to the realization of socialism. Out of the reality of booming capitalist economy, he denied the judgment that capitalism is facing economic crisis every minute. Through an analysis that the working class can not became holders of socialism, he pointed out the path of achieving socialist through revolution was impossible. He suggested a peaceful and democratic socialist route that through enhancing political democracy, strengthening relations with capitalist party, fully using rights of elections given by capitalist parties to actively participating in administration, so as to gradually realizing socialism. He suggested positively evolution to socialism through establishing economic democracy, fully exerting workers' influence in consumer collective, national intervene in private enterprise and municipal socialism's role in socialism budding. Part 4 General judgments on Bernstein's rethink on the direction and path of socialism development. Firstly, Bernstein's socialism thoughts fall into the category of reformism of socialism theories. Secondly, Bernstein did see situation differ from what Marxism prospected on the issue of the development of capitalism and his made analysis on the differences. Nevertheless, much of his analyses on developed capitalism have proved to be true by history. Thirdly, Bernstein's socialism thoughts are circled with the core of fighting for democratic rights and aims at ""growing into socialism peacefully"".

Herbert Marcuse, as an important representative of the Frankfurt School, grabbed the conflict of the capitalist society, ""material wealth, spiritual poverty"", and took it as a starting point. He explored the causes of the ecological ethics's crisis and the way to resolve it, and described his socialist ideals for us. This paper argues that the global ecological crisis and the ecological movement are the social and historical background of Marcuse's ecological ethics; Marx's view of nature and the development of ecological ethics are the ideological and cultural background of Marcuse's ecological ethics.This paper discusses Marcuse's explore of the ecological ethics's crisis of the causes, the way to resolve it and the target of it through the backgrounds of Marcuse's ecological ethics's generation. On the basis of evaluation and analysis of Marcuse's cological ethics, this paper was concerned about Marcuse's ecological ethics in today's theoretical and practical significance. The article thought that Marcuse argues that people under the rule of the capitalist society is in depression, and from this point of view, he took the idea that consumption alienation, technical slavery are the causes of the crisis of ecological ethics. But the deeper reason of the ecological ethics's crisis is the distorted relationship between man and nature which is created by consumption alienation and technical slavery. At the same time, Marcuse explored the way to resolve the crisis through the analysis of the causes, that is, with the ""real needs"" instead of the ""false needs""; developing a new technology to make the work rationalize; the liberation of nature is a means of human liberaion and to shape the reality accord to arts. Finally, Marcuse also shows us his goal of ecological ethics, and which is his socialist ideals. In his socialist society, people get liberated from repression of the rich and be the real freedom without consunption alienation and technology slavery. They are in organic unity with nature. Marcuse's ecological ethics has both rationality and limitations and it brings us a profound theoretical inspiration. Today, Marcuse's ecological ethics still has vital significance, especially in building an ecological civilization society for",1874946882,,Dissertations & Theses," Wan, Yuan YuanWanYuanYuanWan, Yuan Yuan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319178881 , 111173242 , 189128 , 10542495 , 10542495", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874946882?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10542495 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+ecological+ethics+of+herbert+marcuse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wan%2C+Yuan+Yuan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Narrative ethics in hong ying's novels,"Translation from original language as provided by author In contemporary Chinese language context, in his book Heavy Flesh, Liu Xiaofeng proposed the term ""narrative ethics"", believing that narrative ethics does not explore the general principles of life and the basic moral values that human life should follow, nor create logics for life feeling, but about the life stories of personal experience, through personal experienced narratives to present life feeling issues, construct the specific moral sense and ethical aspirations. Since then, many literary critics have begun to study the narrative ethics, through crossover study of narrative and ethics in Eastern and Western intellectual history to investigate narrative ethics as a new development road of ethical criticism, believing that the narrative ethics concerns individual ethical feelings, is a return to literary-based criticism. Hong Ying is a highly controversial writer in contemporary literary world, bold and alternative erotic writing style goes against the ethics in traditional novels. The exaggerated narrative technique and distorted ethics space, deep exploration of human nature in her novels are excellent cases for narrative ethics study. This paper takes Hong Ying's novel as the research objects, starts with the four key words of sex, family, history, people in Hong Ying's novel, uses research method of narrative ethics to explore a variety of possibilities of ethics in Hong Ying's novel, makes analysis of reasons for the ethical formation space in Hong Ying's novel. The full text is divided into four chapters: Chapter Ⅰ discusses the diversity and openness of sexual ethics in Hong Ying's novel, describes three common modes of love in Hong Ying's novel: lesbian, May-December Romance, international love, through the analysis of these three love modes to explore the trauma of female gender, gender relations confrontation and the East-West culture examination; Chapter Ⅱdiscusses the narrative family ethics in Hong Ying's novel, takes the autobiographical novels Hungary Daughter, Good Children of the flowers as the analysis texts, explores from parent-child, sisters, husband-wife the three most important ethical dimensions, from rebelling to grateful in parent-child love, from conflict to reconciliation in sisters love, from free to stable in husband-wife love, obtained that family ethics in Hong Ying's novel regress from the initial sharp, extreme gradually to the traditional family ethics. Chapter Ⅲdiscusses the historical narrative of digestion collective ethics in Hong Ying's novel, the historical narratives of The Field That Year and A Nan are questions and digestion of collective Ethical, highlights the distinctive individual narrative perspective, The Cry of the Peacock is through two space-time cues of the modern Three Gorges Project and the suppression of counter-revolutionary events in history to make a profound ethical reflection of modern civilization and historical movements. Chapter Ⅳdiscusses the Individualism Ethics and Folk Narrative in Hong Ying's novel, explores ""Up"" and ""Down"" miserable narratives in Hong Ying's novel and narrative pattern of small potato escape and redemption. Marginal figures are often protagonists in Hong Ying's novel. She is fond of description of marginal figures, concerning people, not only concerned about the real life situation of the underlying population, but also concerned about the emotional needs of marginalized groups. Novel is an art of fiction. Ethics in novel is not the same as ethics in the real world. In her novels, Hong Ying often concerned about the marginalized ethical space, not a rejection of traditional ethics, but by building something special, abnormal ethical space, to more deeply explore the contradiction and run-in between both sexes, position occupied by the maintenance of family feeling, collective ethics, ethical individualism in the social historical process, as well as its impact on contemporary human values.

But challenges on the sustainability of urban development are introduced by the opposite of benefits. Herein, the ecologilization movement with the goal of harmony between human being and nature is launched worldwide and spread to many areas. City has been constructed following the direction of comprehensive sustainable development of ecosystem. Eco-city with health, efficiency and civilization as features is becoming an ideal model for urban sustainable development all over the world and represents the future development of city. Whereby, sustainable development of eco-city has become human's common demand. As an important part of the eco-city, ecological district has specific function during the construction of eco-city, and reflects the substantial role of ecological civilization toward the city, which is the strategic idea for implementing the urban sustainable development. Based on the theories of international sustainable development, eco-city and ecological district, the index system of sustainable development is summarized and analyzed. The evaluated index system of sustainable development in ecological district is set up through following strictly the principle of index system and taking economic development, social progress and environmental protection as starting points and selecting the representative index by frequency statistics and theoretical analysis. The indicator system is divided into four index layers, including general level, system level which contains three indexes, state level which contains thirteen indexes and variable level which contains forty-six indexes. Meanwhile, using the index system, the situation of sustainable development in the ecological district is comprehensively assessed with hierarchical analysis as the model through the horizontal index, development index and coordinated index. Finally, the feasibility of this evaluated index system is verified considering Futian district of Shenzhen as an example.

Her political thoughts are famous for the originally and specially.When concern on her most important work, The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt starts from the Jewish Problem, discusses the origin factors of totalitarianism, and elaborates the disastrous consequence of totalitarianism. In which, Arendt focuses on the sources, characteristics, processes, conflicts, as well as consequences of capitalism imperialism. She does not hesitate words to discuss the imperialism period, which not only provide s a variety of factors for totalitarian, but also forms a complete imperialistic prospect in its own sense. In Arendt's opinion, Hobbes is the first capitalism philosopher who predicts the appetence of imperialism. She describes Hobbes ""Leviathan"" in an unique aspect, in order to make it being the prototype theory of her imperialism theory. In actual conditions, Arendt believes that the depression swept down capitalist countries in 60s, 70s of 19th century is the outset of imperialism. In this process, accompanied by the output of capital and power, while the combination of capital and the mob, Euro-capitalism states begin to expand towards the expansion. Thus, imperialism shows the outline step by step and imperialist domination has become one of the objects concerned by Arendt. She points out that British and French are expanding for overseas colony with two main political devices of imperialist rule, race and bureaucracy. On the contrary, the states belong to continental imperialism are ruled by Pan-movements, including the Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism. Arendt focues on the relationship between imperialism and the nation-state. She believes that there is an unavoidable tension and contradiction between imperialism and nation-state. Nation-states do not adapt to imperialism expansion rules; nation-states resist imperialism while imperialism disintegrate nation-states. At the same time, imperialism makes use of nationalism, patriotism and replaces nation to race, which are all leading to the collapse of nation-states and the end of human-rights. The imperialism ""Empire factors"" are the really origins of totalitarianism. Arendt's theory of imperialism is benefited from Hobson, Lenin, Luxembourg, however, she also critics about the shortages of their thoughts. When talks about the special style, Arendt describes imperialism by phenomenological way, goes into the situation, uses stories to show the real things. What's more, she adheres to take Europe as her main object with full feelings of European civilization. The credibility of Hannah Arendt's imperialism theory has been called into question. Some conceptions are confused in the text, which weaken the clarity and strength of argument. However, Arendt's imperialism theory makes an important contribution to the study of imperialism. She focuses on the social and psychological root causes, emphasizes the disintegration of European nation-states under imperialism situation, opens up the phenomenological method to study international relations,and enriches history lessons of imperialism",1874973855,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Min JingWangJingMinWang, Min Jing", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319489431 , 111165892 , 189128 , 10545501 , 10545501", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874973855?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10545501 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+imperialism+theory+of+hannah+arendt&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Min+Jing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"College harbin winter ski area to open a feasibility,"Translation from original language as provided by author Colleges and universities in Harbin City, the full implementation of ski elective course imperative.

Receiving the support from China and Vietnam, the CPT is developed in the process of fighting against military government. The decline of the CPT is caused by a series of factors. The CPT has insurmountable shortcomings, including undemocratic regime, outdated strategy that is based on the analysis of the national conditions. The uprising of the democratic forces during the period from October 14th, 1973 and October 6th, 1976 when elected government was in power foreshows the success of the revolution relies on adjusting to the tide of the democracy. However, the Thai military government insisted on the autocratic principles and suppressed the civilians. A large number of left-leaning students and intellectual activists were driven to the forests where they participated in the CPT. When the government realized the growing threat of the CPT, it actively adopted new strategies to establish a more democratic government. On the contrary, the CPT didn't take the opportunity to get its regime reformed. Within Thanin Keaivichian, Kriangsak Chomanan and Prem Tinsulanonda administrations, Thai government took a series of measures to combat the CPT's revolutionary movement and impressive gains have been scoring. The government basically solved the problem of the CPT by the year 1983. Another element that leads to the decline of the CPT is the tremendous change in international relation especially in Southeast Asia in the late 1970s and in the early 1980s, which is a big challenge for the CPT's foreign policy. Owing to lack of flexibility and independence, the CPT failed to grasp its own destiny and fell to the victim of isolation. The conclusion that can be drawn is that the CPT's development in the late 1970s is not the result of the adaptation to the social change but the outcome of its negative adjustment to the participation of the intellectuals. There is lack of momentum to reform the regime and to make a more suitable strategy and in the end the CPT disappeared in the history.

However, few of these scholars and managers have focused on the historical context of environmental management and the ways that history shapes people‘s interactions with natural resource issues. In this dissertation, I utilize a historical approach to examine the experiences of community members from the Alaska Native fishing village of Old Harbor as they interact with the regulatory and knowledge processes of the international Pacific halibut ( Hippoglossus stenolepis ) fishery. I argue that the colonial history of the United States is perpetuated into the present in the processes that guide the management of fish resources in Alaska. Specifically, I argue that this colonial legacy is exhibited in the politics surrounding Pacific halibut management where Western ways of knowing halibut come to dominate decisions made about the resource while Alaska Native ideas and interests in the fishery are pushed to the periphery. This has required Alaska Native halibut fishermen from communities such as Old Harbor to engage with new forms of natural resource science and management in order to participate in processes governing the use of their local resources. I show that in Old Harbor, the marginalization of local ideas about halibut resources has contributed to significant emotional and material impacts for community members including alienation from regulatory processes that impact their fishing activities and loss of access to fish resources that are essential to their livelihoods. To explore these issues, I employed an interdisciplinary methodology that included ethnographic experience in the community of Old Harbor and the regulatory agencies that manage the fishery, examination of historical and current halibut policy documents, participation in a fisheries science investigation into the growth dynamics of halibut in the waters surrounding Old Harbor, and over 40 interviews and oral histories with Old Harbor community members, halibut managers, and halibut biologists. I examined the interaction between Old Harbor and regulatory agency approaches to three aspects of the halibut resource: (1) Biology - ideas about the biological status of fish stocks and surrounding climate. Fisheries science research conducted with the International Pacific Halibut Commission to examine the changing growth patterns in the annual ring structure of halibut otoliths provides important details about halibut growth patterns and life history characteristics. Discussions with and observations of Old Harbor fishermen show that over the course of a long history of seeking these elusive organisms, community members have developed a number of important ideas about the biology, movements, and change of Kodiak area Pacific halibut. When these two as well as a number of other approaches to halibut biology were brought together in negotiations to develop catch limits for the fishery, Western science approaches to halibut biology tended to dominate the discussions. This domination presented challenges for both indigenous and non-indigenous fishermen who understand the resource in different terms. (2) Place - conceptions and meanings tied to fish in space. Old Harbor fishermen and halibut managers exhibit different approaches to the halibut fishing geography. Top-down spatial decisions made by managers and biologists – about issues ranging from where to place regulatory areas, at what scales to assess halibut, and where to hold policy meetings – have significant impact on the lives and geographies of Old Harbor fishermen. (3) Property rights – understandings of fish ownership. Old Harbor ideas about fish property rights differed in many ways from those inherent in the 1995 Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program that privatized the halibut fishery. The import of a private-property system under the IFQ program worked to erode Old Harbor ideas and systems of property rights within their local fisheries. As a result, the IFQ program contributed to a dispossession of Old Harbor‘s fish resources and to devastating impacts on the livelihoods of community members. Ultimately, this dissertation advocates that historical and geographical perspectives are essential for understanding natural resource issues. A historical orientation reveals a significant colonial legacy and social justice implications inherent in Pacific halibut management. While Western-oriented management of the halibut fishery has often marginalized Old Harbor approaches to fish, Old Harbor fishermen have responded to subvert, resist, and change halibut management processes in efforts to legitimize and institutionalize their own visions for the resource. They have continually brought their history and places to the management forum and never accepted domination by Western agency ideas about fish. Their efforts combined with the perspectives of managers and biologists who are concerned with protecting the resource provide a path towards imagining a form of fishery management that is both ecologically sustainable and socially just.",861323529,,Dissertations & Theses," Richmond, Laurie ShannonRichmondShannonLaurieRichmond, Laurie Shannon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2316806891 , 60157651 , 66569 , 9781124549927 , 3445424 , 3445424", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124549927, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/861323529?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," Geography , Environmental Studies , Native American studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Alaska native fishing , Halibut , Indigenous knowledge , Natural resources , Pacific halibut commons , Political ecology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Regulating+a+Mystery%3A%0AScience%2C+colonialism%2C+and+the+politics+of+knowing+in+the+Pacific+halibut+commons&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Richmond%2C+Laurie+Shannon&amp;isbn=9781124549927&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Staging nationalism: Performance, power, and representation in Ghana's state dance ensembles","Through an application of a phenomenological lens, this dissertation explores the lived experiences of participants in Ghana's state dance ensembles as they negotiate the matrix of local and global power dynamics that inform the process of staging their nation. The author argues that performance, power, and representation are inextricably linked, forming a fundamental part of individuals' experience of nationalism. Supplementing studies of nationalism that focus on its function as a broad, or mass, social movement, this work concentrates on the subjectivities and experiences of individuals, foregrounding the voices of consultants to highlight the multiple perspectives of Ghanaian nationalism that coexist and compete with one another. With this focus, the author illustrates that while artists work to engender and propagate unity, or unitary identity, participants embody national ideology subjectively as uniquely situated individuals. As such, while many may believe in the nation and the ideals of nationalism, individuals do not lose sight of their own personal goals. Thus, this work shows how individual performers break through disciplinary mechanisms of control to ""instrumentally"" harness state/national institutions, such as the dance ensembles, to effectively empower themselves through their ingenuity, creative talents, and entrepreneurial efforts. Additionally, throughout the dissertation, the author shows how power is ""glocalized,"" or, how global and local practices and markers of authority co-mingle to create idiomatic power structures within Ghana. Building on the notion of cosmopolitanism put forth by Thomas Turino, the author proposes the concept of ""cosmopolitan modes of power"" to describe this phenomenon. Furthering the author's exploration of glocal power, this study investigates the ways in which performers overtly, and covertly, express their views and criticisms of state power, showing that artists come to understand the state and their relationship to it through artistic performance. Finally, unlike many studies of African nationalism, this work primarily focuses on the post-independence period, exploring how nationalism remains relevant when it is not in direct opposition to colonial rule. The author argues that nationalism requires a relentless re-formation to meet the demands of contemporary circumstances, resulting in a profound renewal and re-shaping of the nation as well as the individual self.",862736306,,Dissertations & Theses," Schauert, Paul W.SchauertW.PaulSchauert, Paul W.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2325058801 , 60479771 , 66569 , 9781124570235 , 3449575 , 3449575", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124570235, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/862736306?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Dance , Music , Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Dance , Ghana , Music , Nationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Staging+nationalism%3A+Performance%2C+power%2C+and+representation+in+Ghana%27s+state+dance+ensembles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schauert%2C+Paul+W.&amp;isbn=9781124570235&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Predictive Factors to Explain the Export of Hazardous Waste by Parties to the Basel Convention,"The number of legal and illegal transboundary shipments of hazardous waste has been increasing in the past decade. The mismanagement of some of these shipments has resulted in illness and death, along with widespread environmental contamination. Despite efforts of the Basel Convention, a treaty that limits the transboundary shipment of waste, to reduce these shipments through mandating the treatment and disposal of any wastes as close as possible to the point of generation, recent national export data indicates that over 80% of all reporting parties to the Basel Convention export part or all of their hazardous waste. The amount of hazardous waste involved in a transboundary movement increased 22% between 2004 and 2006. This study examines select social (level of human development), economic (trade extent, structure, and openness), political (level of democracy and tolerance to civil society), and technological (technology development support) factors that may drive a country to export its waste rather than manage it within its national borders. This issue is examined at the national level because it is the responsibility of the national government to grant permission for these shipments to proceed. Self-reported national data is often incomplete, so missing values analysis was conducted and multiple imputation was performed on the research dataset. Multivariate linear regression was then conducted on each of the five imputed datasets, and the results were pooled. The results of this analysis indicate that technology development support, as determined by a proxy variable consisting of a country’s gross expenditure on research and development in relation to its gross domestic product is a significant predictor of hazardous waste export and that, as technology development increases, hazardous waste exports decrease. The development of in-country waste minimization and waste treatment/disposal technologies may be one explanation for this result. Additional exploratory analyses indicate that the broadness of the trade structure, related to trade diversity, and the level of democracy are predictors of a country’s propensity to export waste, when the technology development support variable is removed from the regression analysis. National-level policy options to address these results may include the encouragement of increased support of research and development, especially in the area of environmentally sound waste management technologies. Also examined are the more immediate needs of the government officials who are responsible for these transboundary shipments. Collective action theory provides the framework through which interactions relating to these shipments will be examined at the national, regional, and international levels.",866328555,,Dissertations & Theses," Kopsick, Deborah A.KopsickA.DeborahKopsick, Deborah A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2346029221 , 61299171 , 66569 , 9781124617060 , 3455060 , 3455060", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124617060, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/866328555?accountid=14496," 0474 Environmental management , 0601 International Relations , 0617 Public administration"," 0474 Environmental management , 0601 International Relations , 0617 Public administration"," 0474 Environmental management , 0601 International Relations , 0617 Public administration",," 0474 Environmental management , 0601 International Relations , 0617 Public administration"," Environmental management , International Relations , Public administration"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Electronic waste , Hazardous waste , Transboundary shipments , Waste exporting",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Predictive+Factors+to+Explain+the+Export+of+Hazardous+Waste+by+Parties+to+the+Basel+Convention&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kopsick%2C+Deborah+A.&amp;isbn=9781124617060&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Navigating multiple worlds in the twenty-first century: Authoring and editing the story of one Japanese kid,"Since the middle of the twentieth century waves of immigration have increased heterogeneity in American classrooms and contributed to new challenges and problems for both teachers and learners. These trends in the United States are, in fact, part of a global phenomenon of large-scale movement of people (García Coll &amp; Marks, 2009; Suarez-Orozco, 2004). In the twenty-first century, children and their families cross borders for various reasons and under widely different circumstances, but all of them must learn to adjust to new expectations and find new ways to belong. This “ethnography of the particular” (Lughod, 1991) uses Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological model to map one boy’s experiences living and going to school in both the United States and Japan. I broadly use sociocultural theory and Lave and Wenger’s (1991) concept of communities of practice to examine those experiences. Although I consider the home, the neighborhood, and the school as important social and cultural settings, my primary focus is on school settings. The three-phase study centers the perspectives of a 10-, 11-, 12-year-old over a 15-month period. The focal participant discussed his views of friendship, his experiences in school, and his expectations of teachers. He also offers a comparative perspective as a participant in the final year of elementary school in both the United States and Japan. Interviews with his parents—primarily his mother—and his teachers as well as whole day observations at Lakeview Elementary School, the Japanese School of Michigan, and Kaichi Shogakko supplement the child’s standpoint. School documents were also analyzed in order to assess written expectations across settings. Two story lines run through the dissertation. The first allows us to learn something about a boy as he goes to school and makes friends during a time of ecological transition; the other invites us to reflect on the systems of which he is a part in both the United States and Japan. I consider daily life in three particular schools, the ways that schools structure childhood, and the challenges border-crossing children face as they navigate implicit and explicit expectations. The study examines how friendships are conceptualized and experienced in different ways in different contexts. The research also allows us to consider how the child at the center of the study experiences and interacts with educational processes across settings while offering a student’s comparative analysis of American and Japanese elementary schooling. Navigating multiple different worlds fosters the development of valuable skills and flexible ways of thinking, but it also presents challenges and includes “costs.” The study provides a fine-grained analysis of one kid’s experience navigating multiple educational, social, and cultural transitions and allows us to see how a child exercises agency, develops competence and builds connections and relationships. Through identifying the processes of adjustment and authoring within contextual complexities, adults can learn to recognize and appreciate children’s emerging identities within the ecological complexity of their lives. The study contributes to an understanding of how communities of educators, teacher educators, and researchers can better serve students as whole human beings by developing capacities to listen to children and discover their stories—from the inside-out. This study suggests that these stories are critical jumping off points for adults who influence the lives of children in classrooms and schools through their teaching, their research and their policies.",867677968,,Dissertations & Theses," Damrow, Amy L.DamrowL.AmyDamrow, Amy L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2352255131 , 61525931 , 66569 , 9781124614649 , 3453454 , 3453454", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124614649, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/867677968?accountid=14496," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0530 Teacher education"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0530 Teacher education"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0530 Teacher education",," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0530 Teacher education"," Multicultural Education , Teacher education"," Education , Child-centered , Childhood , Comparative education , Ecological model , Friendship , Japan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Navigating+multiple+worlds+in+the+twenty-first+century%3A+Authoring+and+editing+the+story+of+one+Japanese+kid&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Damrow%2C+Amy+L.&amp;isbn=9781124614649&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Unmasking the Boston Brahmin: Race and liberalism in the long struggle for reform at Harvard and Radcliffe, 1945–1990","This study explores the role of race and liberalism in the construction of the struggle to reform Harvard and Radcliffe from 1945-1990. Black students and academics organized along the basis of race in order to push through a reform agenda. The program for reform began in the postwar period to protest individual instances of racial injustice and to broadly inform the campus population of black contributions to civilization. This group rallied against the slow progress of racial integration into the social and academic life of a university that professed to have a liberal ideology that supported reform. Student protest in the late 1960s brought about definitive agreements that included an increase in black admissions, more black faculty and administrative hires, and the creation of a black studies department and institute. There was a long struggle because Harvard and Radcliffe lacked the institutional will to implement the racial program of reform in a robust and complete manner during each historical period. The Boston Brahmin construct describes the white administrators who were in the position of power to make the bureaucratic changes but proceeded incrementally in the cause of racial integration. When the Brahmins expanded to include black and white administrators by the 1970s, Harvard's institutional position changed slightly in order to accommodate the new affirmative action policy. The lack of willingness to implement reform, while exhibiting change over time, was tied to a liberal ideology that was avowedly centrist. The cause of black integration into the northern university was given its power and momentum through the organizing efforts of black students and intellectuals and their allies. The periods of conflict and consensus between students and adults helped to steer the course during the long struggle. Without the collective action on the part of these groups and the intervention of great domestic and international movements of the postwar era, racial reform would not have occurred. Although the Afro-America Studies department rested on secure institutional ground in 1990, black faculty hires and black admissions numbers were below what reformers wanted. The cause of racial reform, therefore, remained an ongoing struggle.",870402700,,Dissertations & Theses," Richmond, Afrah DaaimahRichmondDaaimahAfrahRichmond, Afrah Daaimah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2367514791 , 62023941 , 66569 , 9781124640389 , 3454486 , 3454486", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124640389, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/870402700?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0520 Education history , 0745 Higher education"," African American Studies , Black history , Education history , Higher education"," Education , Social sciences , African American Student Movements , Black Power , College integration , Discrimination in higher education , Harvard University , Liberalism , Massachusetts , Radcliffe College",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unmasking+the+Boston+Brahmin%3A+Race+and+liberalism+in+the+long+struggle+for+reform+at+Harvard+and+Radcliffe%2C+1945%E2%80%931990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Richmond%2C+Afrah+Daaimah&amp;isbn=9781124640389&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Counteractions: Resisting and embracing globalization in contemporary public art,"New forms of identity have emerged in the twenty-first century in response to globalization, and community formation has transformed alongside of this phenomenon. New technologies paired with voluntary and involuntary mass migrations have created the opportunity for people to define themselves in new, multi-dimensional, and dynamic ways, no longer solely based on the confines of the nation-state. While continuing to battle the global political, social, and economic structure set in place by the colonial past, post-colonial thinkers have added a new dimension to their scholarship by theorizing how the increased movement of people and information has created a shift in both identity politics and in the area of center and periphery studies. While many scholars have focused their attention on how this shift in identity politics has impacted topics in contemporary art, few art historians have addressed how this shift has transformed the meaning, purpose, content, and effects of public art. This thesis will address this void in scholarship by examining the diverse impact of the changing meaning of identity on contemporary public art using multiple case studies of community-building public art projects commissioned internationally. Looking specifically to public projects that instigate dialogue via technology, the land, and the confrontation of public space, I contend that public artists working today are able to counteract the detrimental forces of globalization by embracing the potential benefits of this phenomenon.",873459411,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldstein, LoriGoldsteinLoriGoldstein, Lori", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2382654701 , 62609141 , 66569 , 9781124672045 , 1493870 , 1493870", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124672045, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/873459411?accountid=14496," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history"," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history"," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history",," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history"," Art Criticism , Art history"," Communication and the arts , Community , Ecology , Globalization , Identity , Public art , Technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Counteractions%3A+Resisting+and+embracing+globalization+in+contemporary+public+art&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldstein%2C+Lori&amp;isbn=9781124672045&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Health in Black and White: Debates on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in Brazil,"In 2006, the Brazilian Health Council approved a National Health Policy for the Black Population. The Policy is striking because it promotes the image of a biologically and culturally discrete black population in a nation where racial classification has historically been relatively fluid and ambiguous. It transforms established patterns of racialization by collapsing ""brown"" ( pardo ) and ""black"" ( preto ) Brazilian Census categories into a single ""black population"" ( população negra ) to be considered a special-needs group by the public health apparatus. This construction resembles the United States' dominant mode of racialization based on hypodescent and represents a significant departure from hegemonic portrayals of Brazil as a racially mixed nation. Furthermore, the Policy challenges national ideologies of racial and cultural unity by affirming the existence of an essential black body with specific health concerns, as well as an essential Afro-Brazilian culture that materializes in recommendations for culturally competent health care. As such, the Policy constitutes an important site for new negotiations of racial and cultural identity in Brazil. In this dissertation, I explore the political and social implications of treating racial and ethnic groups differently within Brazilian health care. I examine how the re-definition and medicalization of racial and cultural identities unfolds in public clinics, temples of Afro-Brazilian religion, and social movements based in São Luís and São Paulo, Brazil. Through an analysis of ethnographic data that I collected over twenty-four months, I assess the impact of recent developments in race-conscious health policy on Brazilians' lived experiences of race, ethnicity, and health disparities. I argue that the new Policy, and its associated health programs, signals the emergence of a new biopolitical paradigm in which the Brazilian state formalizes citizens' racial and ethnic differences in order to address inequalities among them. I also show that many aspects of these programs, which incorporate global discourses and concepts related to health equity, fail to resonate with Brazilian citizens' notions about race and health. Consequently, patients and healthcare providers often resist the new measures. The result is a disjuncture between policy and practice that ultimately hinders Brazil's efforts to reduce health inequalities among its citizens.",875560709,,Dissertations & Theses," Pagano, AnnaPaganoAnnaPagano, Anna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2393990441 , 62852321 , 66569 , 9781124703657 , 3458492 , 3458492", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124703657, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/875560709?accountid=14496," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0769 Health care management"," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0769 Health care management"," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0769 Health care management",," 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0769 Health care management"," Black studies , Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies , Political science , Public policy , Ethnic studies , Health care management , Whites , Brazil"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Biopolitics , Brazil , Ethnicity , Health , Medicine , Race",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Health+in+Black+and+White%3A+Debates+on+Racial+and+Ethnic+Health+Disparities+in+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pagano%2C+Anna&amp;isbn=9781124703657&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Equality on trial: Women and work in the age of Title VII,"In 1964, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act outlawed sex discrimination in employment. Title VII replaced the bedrock of working women's rights discourse, difference, with a new imperative, equality, but did not define sex discrimination or identify its remedies. Yet, just a few decades later, Title VII had transformed women's status in the American workplace. This dissertation analyzes struggles to define and implement the sex discrimination provision of Title VII from 1964 to the early 1990s. In those years, the meaning of sex equality was hotly contested. Aggrieved women mobilized around Title VII within their workplaces and before government agencies. For such women, equality was personal in an era when the personal was newly politicized. Legal and interest group advocates harnessed and organized women's complaints. Administrators streamlined government processes, categorized claims and mediated disputes. Courts weighed competing interests in light of the new legal imperative for sex equality. A political history from both the bottom-up and top-down, this dissertation expands existing conceptions of political actors and processes; probes the inherent challenges of implementing progressive ideology; and demonstrates both the power and the shortcomings of the law as a tool of social change. Women's workplace activism outside of feminist and labor organizations demonstrates the breadth and ideological diversity of the second wave even as members of flagship feminist groups disputed the meaning of Title VII. Yet, the scope of sex equality law also was shaped by the government agencies and legal mechanisms that fielded and rendered women's claims legally legible. As a result, the same processes that yielded some of the second wave's most symbolic victories also narrowed the terms of sex equality. This study argues that contemporary definitions of workplace sex equality as facility of access to jobs and the downplaying of sex and gender at work represent the triumph of elite interests and administrative efficiency. This outcome silenced those who had argued that Title VII promised substantive and redistributive equality that could coexist with rather than ignore or penalize difference. As a result, systemic class and race inequalities among women were pushed outside the purview of the law just as the triumph of the service economy and growing disparities of wealth compounded those same inequalities. This study contributes to scholarly literature on women, gender and sexuality; labor, political economy, race, and class; claims-making and social movements; and law, citizenship and statecraft in postwar American society. It draws upon a range of legal, organizational, and personal records. Key collections include the records of federal agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor; interest groups such as the National Organization for Women and the American Civil Liberties Union; the records of labor unions such as the Service Employees International Union; attorneys' and activists' personal papers and oral history interviews; briefs, depositions, and other records of court proceedings; and more. Considered together, workers' correspondence and complaints, activist and government records, and documents produced by legal confrontations reveal how struggles over Title VII gave way to broad consensus by the 1990s.",876606691,,Dissertations & Theses," Turk, Katherine LeeTurkLeeKatherineTurk, Katherine Lee", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2398682231 , 62930281 , 66569 , 9781124718293 , 3460246 , 3460246", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124718293, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/876606691?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," American history , Law , Womens studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Class action , Feminism , Gender equality , Labor , Lawsuit , Sex discrimination , Sex equality , Title VII , Women workers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Equality+on+trial%3A+Women+and+work+in+the+age+of+Title+VII&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turk%2C+Katherine+Lee&amp;isbn=9781124718293&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“The dynamic side of life”—The emergence of Mary Coffin Ware Dennett as a radical sex educator,"In 1915, Mary Ware Dennett wrote a significant yet little known sex education manual for her two sons entitled The Sex Side of Life, an Explanation for Young People . In it, she defied convention by expressing her radical views about sexuality, first to her own two sons and later to the public. Dennett offered forthright and specific information about the physiological, scientific, moral and emotional aspects of sexuality at a time when sex education and sex educators, if they existed at all, typically attempted to repress or control sexuality, and education about it, rather than to inform. 1 Many people considered Dennett’s book radical because she challenged prevailing Victorian attitudes about sexuality, women and the transfer of culture. Additionally, she dared to express the view that sex was not just for procreation but was pleasurable. Dennett’s manual for her sons was copied and passed along to her son’s friends and to the children of her friends and colleagues. It was published in The Medical Review of Reviews in 1918 and thousands of copies were distributed to institutions and individuals worldwide before she was arrested for sending obscenity through the mail in 1929. Fourteen years after publication, her arrest became a cause célèbre. Through narrative inquiry, the study researched Dennett’s transition from the private to the public side of life by looking at her cultural and intellectual heritage, personal life and the historical context of industrial capitalism. Dennett’s unequivocal conviction that all members of a truly democratic society have the right to know was quite radical in its time. It is still radical today because implicit in that outlook is the belief that with knowledge, ordinary people have the ability and the responsibility to chart their own course in life without control from those on top of the social hierarchy. Freire said, “A real humanist can be identified more by his trust in people, which engages him in their struggle, than by a thousand actions in their favor without that trust.” Dennett was a true humanist, trusting in the ability of ordinary people. 2 Nearly a century after publication, the lessons that surfaced from Dennett’s transition from the private to the public side of life are still valid. The ability to actively engage with the world is critical for empowerment and active engagement can only occur with complete access to knowledge and information.

For most of its history, Danbury, Connecticut was unusually receptive to immigrant populations, especially in contrast to a legacy of nativism in the state. Commercial developers and City Hall alike have long capitalized on a proud heritage of diversity and tolerance, framing Danbury as a multicultural Mecca. Historically, residents made it clear that racist or nativist organizations are not welcome, whether the Know-Nothings in the 1850s or the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and 1970s. But today, Danbury's civil sphere is a hotbed of debate concerning “illegal immigration.” As my very first field notes reveal, I thought I knew this city, and I was baffled by the polarization that has escalated since 2005: I knew there had been some changes since I had last visited Danbury in the 1980s, but nothing could have prepared me for this—it was as if I had teleported out of New England and into a small Latin American city—it was a whole new world. Indeed, Danbury represents a new type of immigrant “world.” The latest migrants arrive from non-European, non-“white” nations, and moreover, many are unauthorized. It is one of dozens of small cities and rural towns where large numbers of migrants have radically transformed the ethnic and racial makeup of the population and have challenged what it means to be an “American,” or an “immigrant,” for that matter. With somewhere between 12–15 thousand unauthorized residents, Danbury officials estimate that the foreign-born represent nearly 40 percent of the city's population of nearly 90,000. Main Street, with a majority of its signs in Spanish or Portuguese, embodies a material representation of the demographic changes that have polarized small, but very vocal parts of the community into factions known in the local vernacular as “anti-immigrant” and “pro-illegal.” With this project, I sought to understand what changed in Danbury to make such a formerly tolerant city into a hotbed of public debate. To do this I had to unravel the workings of how ongoing debates concerning the city's foreign-born population are played out within the civil sphere—through local media, public opinion, “City Hall,” local faith communities, non-profit groups and other voluntary organizations. Three central lines of inquiry underpinned and focused my fieldwork and analysis: 1) How do residents, community leaders and municipal officials engage in the debates and controversies concerning Danbury's immigrant population? Do the debates look/sound different “on the ground” versus across the Internet, in print, or as “official” texts? 2) What is the nature of the so-called “anti-immigrant” movement in the city, and the ostensibly “pro-illegal” activism? Is there a middle ground? 3) What do the structures of meaning behind the categories of “Immigrant,” “Alien,” and “American” reveal about social and symbolic boundary work—put more bluntly, who “belongs” to Danbury (or to the United States, for that matter), who doesn't, and why? But in the larger scheme of things, why does what goes on in Danbury's civil sphere matter? In many respects, Danbury is a microcosm of the national scenario, and the ways in which so-called “illegal” immigrants are being classified today in the United States is far more than a mere theoretical exercise about who “belongs” in the country and who doesn't. The debates about “illegal immigration” grow uglier by the day, especially as Congress continues to drag its heels on comprehensive reform legislation, an Obama campaign promise that has withered rapidly. And unfortunately, human insecurity remains the everyday reality in immigrant communities across the country. The diversity of a place is not something a community necessarily gets to pick and choose. Global flows of finance, capital and knowledge have the overwhelming say in where and how the flows of migrants are directed. Why wait until the (melting) pot is nearly boiling over to have large-scale, meaningful dialogue about living in an increasingly diverse society? Legacies both distant in space and time (the Persians, Adolf Hitler, the Khmer Rouge) and those still fresh in our social memory or ongoing (Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Darfur) remind us that who is “in” and who is “out” still matters very much, to a great many people and that universalistic or humanistic conceptions of citizenship are not the empirical reality throughout most of the globe.",884252876,,Dissertations & Theses," Jaworsky, Bernadette NadyaJaworskyNadyaBernadetteJaworsky, Bernadette Nadya", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2429041041 , 63648701 , 66569 , 9781124804545 , 3467429 , 3467429", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124804545, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884252876?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," American studies , Ethnic studies , Social structure"," Social sciences , Connecticut , Danbury , Immigrants , Immigration , Symbolic boundaries , Undocumented migrants",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CIt%27s+just+not+Main+Street+anymore%21%E2%80%9D%3A+Mapping+Out+the+Boundaries+of+Belonging+in+a+New+Immigrant+Gateway&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jaworsky%2C+Bernadette+Nadya&amp;isbn=9781124804545&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Prescribed Fictions: Literary and Medical Representations of Hermaphrodism in Nineteenth-Century France,"My dissertation asks why nineteenth-century fiction brims with sexually ambiguous characters. Departing from traditional accounts of fictional androgyny as timeless reflections of myth, I investigate epistemological and formal links between literature and contemporary medicine, where the figure of the hermaphrodite was simultaneously making a marked resurgence. The first half of my project offers a cultural history of nineteenth-century hermaphrodism that provides a new framework in which to understand literary representations of androgyny, which I analyze in the second half. Divided into two chapters, the first part is based on original archival research, and argues that ""true sex""—the idea that each body has one and only one sex—was not an already accepted and easily identifiable truism as conventional historiography contends, but rather was highly contested throughout the entire century. In the first chapter, ""The Fiction of True Sex: Defining Hermaphrodism in Medicine and Literature,"" I show that the nineteenth-century medical record undermines the idea that each person has one and only one sex. Throughout the century, some doctors made a stand for true hermaphrodism, many more could not identify the sex of their living patients, and ""experts"" constantly disagreed not only about findings, but also about how best to establish sex in doubtful cases. In the second chapter, ""Hermaphrodite Outlaws,"" I demonstrate that the inflexibility of the Napoleonic Code, which required that all infants be sexed dimorphically as either male or female at birth, was challenged by doctors and medico-legal experts who believed either that the Code was out of step with scientific progress, or that it did not do enough to protect citizens from beings who were neither wholly female nor wholly male In sensational court cases that riveted domestic and international audiences both scientific and lay—doctors and jurists struggled to reconcile cases of doubtful sex with scientific evidence, social welfare, and with the Code itself. Precisely because no one method for determining sex proved entirely foolproof, I argue that doctors and medico-legal experts began to rely on a kind of narrative to support their claims—a narrative that closely minors the one being developed simultaneously in contemporary fiction, and especially, but not exclusively, by Realism. The Realist text shares a common origin with the burgeoning social sciences in the early part of the nineteenth century, which, in turn, led to the advent of teratology, or study of monstrosity. It is this shared narrative and common origin that justifies my examination of literary androgyny in the second half of my dissertation, which is also comprised of two chapters. In the third chapter, ""Is She or Isn't He? Plotting Ambiguous Sex,"" I show how long-forgotten popular novels become important intertexts for canonical fiction on hermaphrodism. Whether the influence is intentional and acknowledged as Balzac admits of Latouche's Fragoletta, or perhaps unintentional or repressed as may have been the case with Cuisin's Clémentine, these popular novels help bridge the gap between medical discourse and fictional representations of androgyny. By examining canonical fiction by Balzac, Gautier, and Zola through the lens of these forgotten popular novels, we can see how works that have been described by literary critics as rehearsing a timeless version of the androgyne myth actually interrogate the very same social anxiety as is present in contemporary debates surrounding hermaphrodism in medicine and the law. Just like their medical brethren, novelists experiment on hermaphrodites in their own fictions by harnessing the power of doubtful sex as a motor to keep the reader reading. Despite apparently heteronormative endings, novelists also subvert ""true sex"" in ways which closely mirror the medical record. In the final chapter, ""Inheriting Hermaphrodism: How Degeneration Theory Changed Literature and Medicine,"" I trace the convergence of hermaphrodism and homosexuality in the etiology of inversion in sexology, and show how the theory of degenerate heredity transforms narratives of hermaphrodism in both medical case studies and fin-de-siècle fiction. In the epilogue, I show how the nineteenth-century resistance to ""true sex"" in medicine and fiction anticipates the grassroots Intersex Movement of the 1990s, when patients rebelled against medical protocols that endeavored to shape their ambiguous bodies during childhood through the use of surgery and hormone treatment so that they would conform to binary sex.",884623512,,Dissertations & Theses," Linton, Anne ElizabethLintonElizabethAnneLinton, Anne Elizabeth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2431694571 , 63733211 , 66569 , 9781124807164 , 3467513 , 3467513", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124807164, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884623512?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0585 Science history"," 0313 Romance literature , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0585 Science history"," 0313 Romance literature , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0585 Science history",," 0313 Romance literature , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0585 Science history"," Romance literature , GLBT Studies , Science history"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Androgyny , France , Hermaphrodism , History of medicine , Nineteenth century , Queer",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Prescribed+Fictions%3A+Literary+and+Medical+Representations+of+Hermaphrodism+in+Nineteenth-Century+France&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Linton%2C+Anne+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781124807164&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The prison of democracy: US legal culture and the idea of Leavenworth Penitentiary,"This dissertation uses Leavenworth Penitentiary, built as a replica of the US capitol building, as a prism for examining the relationship between prisons and democracy. It analyzes four historical moments that illustrate the prison's revivification as a democratic institution. The first chapter reconstructs the legal culture that preceded Leavenworth and the competing ideas of democratic justice that emerged from the context of Bleeding Kansas, and produced four federal prisons and one state institution. The second chapter argues that the congenital formation of Leavenworth and Fort Leavenworth military prison as sites for the punishment of Native Americans continued the US Indian Wars in a new form. The chapter examines Leavenworth's role in the relocation of Indian Territory from Kansas to Oklahoma, and in the production of Native criminality. The third chapter argues that Leavenworth was part of a state pedagogical project that crossed the interconnected social landscapes of the prison's inside and outside. The chapter examines the relationship between prisons, citizens, and race through three interconnected social movements imprisoned for espionage during WWI as federal prisons became segregated institutions. The removal and reattachment of citizenship to the body is explored through resistances to civil death among the 99 members of the Industrial Workers of the World, 62 members of the Black 24 th Infantry, and 3 central figures in the Mexican Revolution. The next chapter focuses on the history of prison litigation at Leavenworth and the success of ""jailhouse lawyers"" in drawing national attention to Leavenworth's position as ""the next Attica,"" and in forcing the federal Bureau of Prisons to agree to close Leavenworth in 1974—a decision that was reversed within one year, as Leavenworth assumed a new role within the federal system as the home of federal habeas law. The chapter examines Leavenworth's place in a new legal framework of preemptive prosecution, total solitary confinement, and behavior modification. The epilogue considers Leavenworth's place in the global war on tenor, as the proposed ""home"" for GITMO detainees. It suggests that practices of torture reflect practices within US prisons and that a more complicated theory of prisons and democracy is necessary.",898367657,,Dissertations & Theses," Benson, Sara M.BensonM.SaraBenson, Sara M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2485218941 , 63954051 , 66569 , 9781124967790 , 3480348 , 3480348", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124967790, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/898367657?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology",," 0323 American studies , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0627 Criminology"," American studies , Law , Political science , Criminology"," Social sciences , Bleeding Kansas , Critical race and legal studies , Kansas , Law and society - prison law , Leavenworth Penitentiary , Legal culture , Prisons , Punishment , Slavery , United States , War on Terror",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+prison+of+democracy%3A++US+legal+culture+and+the+idea+of+Leavenworth+Penitentiary&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Benson%2C+Sara+M.&amp;isbn=9781124967790&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Utopian (Post)Colonies: Rewriting Race and Gender after the Haitian Revolution,"""Utopian (Post)Colonies: Rewriting Race and Gender after the Haitian Revolution"" examines the works of French women authors writing from just before the first abolition of slavery in the French colonies in 1794 to those writing at the time of the second and final abolition in 1848. These women, each in different and evolving ways, challenged notions of race and gender that excluded French women from political debate and participation and kept Africans and their descendants in subordinated social positions. However, even after Haitian independence, French authors continued to understand the colony as a social and political enterprise to be remodeled and ameliorated rather than abandoned. These authors' rewritings of race and gender thus played a crucial role in a more general French engagement with the idea of the colony-as-utopia. In 1791, at the very beginning of the Haitian Revolution—which was also the beginning of France's unexpected first postcolonial moment—colonial reform, abolitionism, and women's political participation were all passionately debated issues among French revolutionaries. These debates faded in intensity as the nineteenth century progressed. Slavery, though officially abolished in 1794, was reestablished in 1802. Divorce was again made illegal in 1816. Even in 1848, when all men were granted suffrage and slavery was definitively abolished in the French colonies, women were not given the right to vote. Yet, throughout the early nineteenth century, the notion of the colony-as-utopia continued to offer a space for French women authors to imagine gender equality and women's empowerment through their attempts to alter racial hierarchy. My first chapter examines the development of abolitionism through theatre in the writings of Olympe de Gouges (1748–1793). At a time when performance was understood to have influential moral implications, de Gouges imagines a utopian colony to be possible through the power of performance to produce moral action. In my second chapter, I analyze how, during the slowly re-emerging abolitionist movements of the 1820s, Sophie Doin (1800–1846) and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore (1786–1859) expose the individual emotional suffering of slaves in an effort to make the violence of enslavement visible. In the process of making this violence visible, Doin's La Famille noire suivie de trois nouvelles blanches et noires (1825–6) and Desbordes-Valmore's Sarah (1821), in contrast with Claire de Duras's Ourika (1823), mobilize respect for motherhood to bolster their abolitionist claims. My third chapter analyzes the colonial novels of Madame Charles Reybaud (1802–1870), a forgotten but once-popular novelist, who uses the idea of the colony to develop a feminist re-definition of marriage involving the emancipation of males from their own categories of enslavement. Influenced by the Saint-Simonian thought of the July Monarchy, Reybaud imagines a utopian colony organized by a feminized French humanitarianism that attempts to separate French racial identity from that of the ""Creole"" colonizer. My final chapter compares this French desire to yoke utopia to colony with nineteenth-century Haitian attempts to reveal the opposite synergy: the inseparability of the institutions of slavery and colonialism. Haiti's first novel, Stella (1859) by Émeric Bergeaud (1818–1858), opposes racial hierarchy and defends Haitian independence in the face of harsh discrimination from an international community whose economies still depended on colonialism and slavery. In contrast with the previous texts studied in this dissertation, Stella imagines Haiti to have the potential to become a utopian postcolony, a nation freed from the constraints of colonialism in such a way as to serve as a model for a future in which racial hierarchy has no power.",902636655,,Dissertations & Theses," Curtis, Lesley ShannonCurtisShannonLesleyCurtis, Lesley Shannon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2505720591 , 61271991 , 66569 , 9781124840918 , 3468895 , 3468895", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124840918, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/902636655?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0733 Gender studies",," 0313 Romance literature , 0733 Gender studies"," Romance literature , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Colonial , Colonialism , France , French , Haiti , Haitian revolution , Nineteenth-century , Race , Women , Women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Utopian+%28Post%29Colonies%3A+Rewriting+Race+and+Gender+after+the+Haitian+Revolution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Curtis%2C+Lesley+Shannon&amp;isbn=9781124840918&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""“Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom”: Black spirituality and the rise of the antislavery movement, 1740–1841","This dissertation traces the evolution of black abolitionism in colonial North America and the United States from 1740 to 1841. Focusing primarily on reformers, theologians, and activists, it examines specifically the ways in which spiritual beliefs shaped black opposition to slavery. It places black abolitionists in an international context and analyzes the transatlantic connections they developed and maintained in their battle against slavery and prejudice. Inspired by eighteenth-century pietistic revival, a West African cosmological heritage, and the Enlightenment emphasis on natural rights, men and women of African descent began protesting slavery publicly during the colonial era. With the onset of the American Revolution, they located republican egalitarianism within a sacred framework and underscored the contradiction inherent in a slaveholding polity allegedly predicated on Protestant Christianity. After 1800, many black activists adapted the pietistic model of itinerancy and evangelism to agitate against both slavery and racial discrimination. During the 1820s, black antislavery reformers, disillusioned by the nation’s rejection of abolition and angered by the American Colonization Society’s 1817 plan to send free blacks to Africa, embraced more radical measures. By 1829, they demanded immediate emancipation and after 1830 consolidated their strategies into a full-fledged radical movement. This study relies on three investigative methods. First, it employs untapped or underutilized archival and textual sources that uncover a biracial transatlantic network of activism as early as the 1780s. Second, it contextualizes familiar documents including newspaper reports, fugitive slave advertisements, conversion narratives, and public orations more finely. Finally, it draws on black intellectual productions rarely used in discussions of abolitionism. This dissertation intervenes in the historiography of African American history and culture, abolitionist literature, and transatlantic intellectual history. By placing people of African descent central to the emergence of abolitionism, it offers an important interpretation for how one of the most significant social reform movements in American history developed. The dissertation argues that the call for immediate emancipation that gained currency after 1830 originated in black reformers’ collective efforts to put into practice their spiritual convictions.",906725017,,Dissertations & Theses," Cappiello, Dianne WheatonCappielloWheatonDianneCappiello, Dianne Wheaton", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2523354561 , 65797961 , 66569 , 9781267016331 , 3485095 , 3485095", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267016331, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/906725017?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality"," African American Studies , American studies , Black history , American history , Spirituality"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Abolitionism , Antislavery , Black activism , Spirituality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CWhere+the+spirit+of+the+Lord+is%2C+there+is+freedom%E2%80%9D%3A+Black+spirituality+and+the+rise+of+the+antislavery+movement%2C+1740%E2%80%931841&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cappiello%2C+Dianne+Wheaton&amp;isbn=9781267016331&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Seasonal and diurnal patterns of spatial spread, grouping dynamics and influence of resources on a free-ranging cattle herd in a semi-arid rangeland in south Texas, USA","Knowledge of scale-dependent factors that affect the distribution of ungulate herds, such as cattle, is essential for the development of more accurate predictive models of animal movement and the management of sustainable agriculture. Our objectives were to evaluate the seasonal and diurnal patterns of herd spread, explore grouping dynamics, and the influence of dominance ranks, seasonal changes in forage biomass, use of shade, water and supplemental feed areas on cattle distribution. Positional and activity information of eleven free-ranging Bonsmara, Bos taurus , cows were obtained at five minute intervals using Global Positioning System collars. We conducted a total of 12 trials each of three weeks from August 2007 to August 2009 in a 457ha shrub-dominated savanna in South Texas. Spread was obtained by calculating the average Euclidean distance of individuals to the center of the herd. The association software package, ASSOC1, was used to analyze spatio-temporal interactions. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, an indicator of available forage biomass, was calculated using satellite imagery. Number of GPS fixes was used as an indicator of animal use of shade patches and water and supplemental feeding areas. In this semi-arid environment, herd spread was greatest and subgroup division occurred during summer when forage biomass was high. Herd spread was the least and iv shade patches were used more during winter when forage biomass was low. Throughout the year spread was smallest and use of shade patches highest during the midday period compared to other periods of the day. Location of individuals in the center of the herd was not associated with their dominance ranking. There was no significant overall pattern of seasonal changes in cattle use of water and supplemental feeding areas. Seasonal forage availability and shade patches seem to have a greater influence on herd dispersion patterns and grouping dynamics than any effect of social dominance. Herd distribution is likely related to changes in forage biomass and temperature fluctuations which drive compensatory night-time feeding and thermoregulatory actions. Accurate ethological studies of herds depend on our ability to understand herd dynamics at multiple scales that affect and are relevant to animal’s response to the landscape.",909602926,,Dissertations & Theses," Cheleuitte-Nieves, Christopher EliasCheleuitte-NievesEliasChristopherCheleuitte-Nieves, Christopher Elias", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2531289251 , 63820551 , 66569 , 9781267035592 , 3486175 , 3486175", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267035592, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/909602926?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0473 Agriculture , 0475 Animal sciences"," 0329 Ecology , 0473 Agriculture , 0475 Animal sciences"," 0329 Ecology , 0473 Agriculture , 0475 Animal sciences",," 0329 Ecology , 0473 Agriculture , 0475 Animal sciences"," Ecology , Agriculture , Animal sciences"," Biological sciences , Cattle herd , Diurnal patterns , Grouping dynamics , Seasonal patterns",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Seasonal+and+diurnal+patterns+of+spatial+spread%2C+grouping+dynamics+and+influence+of+resources+on+a+free-ranging+cattle+herd+in+a+semi-arid+rangeland+in+south+Texas%2C+USA&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cheleuitte-Nieves%2C+Christopher+Elias&amp;isbn=9781267035592&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Domesticating foreign affairs: The African-American family, Korean war orphans, and Cold War civil rights","Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans adopted hundreds of Korean children who had been displaced by the Korean War. These adoptions most often placed the children of Korean women and African-American soldiers in the care of African-American or interracial families throughout the U.S. Adoptions involving African-American families and Afro-Korean children were unlike other U.S.-Korean adoptions and they confounded child welfare communities faced with crafting protocols to accommodate these placements. This dissertation examines how the qualities adoption agencies' valued in potential parents constituted an idealized version of domesticity that positioned African-Americans outside of conventional definitions of suitable adoptive parents. I argue that African-Americans' resistance of gender and racial barriers embedded in adoption procedures expanded institutional definitions of ideal adoptive families and promoted public discourses that equated their U.S. and Korean adoptions with the attainment of civil rights and the containment of communism. This study analyzes the ways Afro-Korean adoptions revealed the political dimensions of the African-American family. I explore how members of disparate communities interpreted the significance of African Americans' adoptions and constructed discourses to explain the political dimensions of these so-called private arrangements. Two closely related dynamics made African Americans' participation in Korean adoptions possible. First, Afro-Korean adoptions took place at a critical point in the American Civil Rights Movement when efforts to eliminate racial inequality shined a spotlight on institutions that perpetuated racial exclusion. This circumstance made a few reform-minded social workers sensitive to the ways inequality shaped African Americans choices, even as they employed the procedure of matching families based on shared racial identity. This method simultaneously exposed how race shaped the adoption industry and made African Americans indispensable to Afro-Korean placements. Second, Cold War anxieties made U.S.-Korean adoptions a central feature of U.S.-Korean relations and put American race relations on display in international arenas. In this context threats to the African-American adoptive family destabilized the nation's investment in and performance of democratic ideals. Together, these influences made Afro-Korean adoptive families politically powerful and symbolically valuable to African Americans' struggles for racial equality.",912378341,,Dissertations & Theses," Graves, Kori A.GravesA.KoriGraves, Kori A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2545546961 , 63839691 , 66569 , 9781267067364 , 3488949 , 3488949", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267067364, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/912378341?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , African-American , Civil rights , Cold War , International adoption , Korean",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Domesticating+foreign+affairs%3A++The+African-American+family%2C+Korean+war+orphans%2C+and+Cold+War+civil+rights&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Graves%2C+Kori+A.&amp;isbn=9781267067364&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Christian ethics of eating: Food and self from a Korean ecofeminist perspective,"Eating, the most basic and intimate interaction we have with nature, provides a place to being to understand who we are and how we relate to God, nature, and other human beings. This dissertation examines the discourse of the concepts of self and nature behind Genetically Manipulated (GM) food technology from a Korean ecofeminist perspective that is strengthen by the ecological understanding of eating and self put forward by the second successor of the Korean Tonghak movement in the nineteenth century, Haewol. The goal of this project is to build up an ecological self understanding that is matched by a new social practice that overcomes the isolated concept of self that contributes significantly to today's ever growing environmental problems and organizes human life in relation to one another and to nature, and to strategize an everyday life action that is applied to the problems of global bio-food commerce today. The understanding of self and others in the works of ecological philosophers, such as deep ecologists, ecofeminists, and Christian environmentalists, as a theoretical tool for a response to the consequences of GM food, informs the critique of the classical understanding of human and nature found in modern science. In order to actualize the affirmation that all beings are interconnected and interdependent, particular attention is given to Haewol's ""Pob ei Hannul (Food is God),"" the Christian Eucharist tradition (Jesus' table fellowship), and sociological and feminist studies of ""everyday life."" These diverse sources all agree that a holistic understanding of eating that overcomes hierarchical dualism between the physical and spiritual, body and mind, and nature and culture contributes to forming an understanding of the inter-relational self that generates discontent with the patriarchal and hierarchical relationships between God, nature, and human. In other words, one's daily food practice, as a way of actualizing the interconnectedness among God, nature, and humans, resists the distorted relationship between God, nature, and humans and creates a sustainable bio-community of human and nonhuman beings.",912739150,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Yun HuiKimHuiYunKim, Yun Hui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2547860061 , 63346441 , 66569 , 9781267087003 , 3489316 , 3489316", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267087003, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/912739150?accountid=14496," 0359 Food Science , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0359 Food Science , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0359 Food Science , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0477 Environmental Studies",," 0359 Food Science , 0394 Ethics , 0469 Theology , 0477 Environmental Studies"," Food Science , Ethics , Theology , Environmental Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Health and environmental sciences , Biological sciences , Bioethics , Ecofeminism , Environment , Ethics of eating , Faith , Food , GM foods , Genetically modified , Religion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Christian+ethics+of+eating%3A++Food+and+self+from+a+Korean+ecofeminist+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Yun+Hui&amp;isbn=9781267087003&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A dis-ability perspective on the stigmatization of dissent: Critical pedagogy, critical criminology, and critical animal studies","This intersectional and interdisciplinary social science qualitative dissertation in six chapters is grounded in critical research and theory for the purpose of engaged public service. This project is grounded in three formal disciplines: education, criminology, and peace and conflict studies. Within those three disciplines, this project interweaves newly emerging fields of study together, including critical animal studies, eco-ability, disability studies, environmental justice, transformative justice, green criminology, anarchist studies, and critical criminology, This dissertation adopts three qualitative methodologies; autoethnography, case study, and critical pedagogy. My project uses the animal advocacy movement as its case study. Using a critical pedagogy methodology, I explored why and how activists respond to the stigmatization of being labeled as or associated with terrorists, a process I refer to as “terrorization.” Chapter One is an introduction to global ecological conditions and post-September 11, 2001 US political repressive conditions toward environmental and animal advocates. Chapter Two introduces the three methodologies that employed for this research project: autoethnography, case study, and critical pedagogy. Chapter Three argues that stigmatization is a form of repression grounded from personal experiences and examined by means of autoethnography disability studies, and critical criminology. Chapter Four, introduces the case study of this dissertation: critical animal studies, which is influenced by green criminology and anarchist studies. In Chapter Five, through a critical pedagogical methodology, fourteen participants engage in a dialogue on responding to political repression. Finally, in Chapter Six, two new concepts are introduced to interweave all the fields of study and topics in the dissertation together—eco-ability, a theory rooted in disability studies, critical animal studies, and ecology, and transformative justice, a restorative, liberatory, and empowering alternative justice system.",922668707,,Dissertations & Theses," Nocella, Anthony J., IINocellaJ.AnthonyIINocella, Anthony J., II", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2592366191 , 67543152 , 66569 , 9781267178978 , 3495112 , 3495112", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267178978, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/922668707?accountid=14496," 0456 Pedagogy , 0563 Peace Studies , 0627 Criminology"," 0456 Pedagogy , 0563 Peace Studies , 0627 Criminology"," 0456 Pedagogy , 0563 Peace Studies , 0627 Criminology",," 0456 Pedagogy , 0563 Peace Studies , 0627 Criminology"," Pedagogy , Peace Studies , Criminology"," Education , Social sciences , Animal advocacy , Critical animal studies , Critical criminology , Critical pedagogy , Disability studies , Dissent , Ecoterrorism , Stigmatization , Transformative justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+dis-ability+perspective+on+the+stigmatization+of+dissent%3A+Critical+pedagogy%2C+critical+criminology%2C+and+critical+animal+studies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nocella%2C+Anthony+J.%2C+II&amp;isbn=9781267178978&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Congress and DOD Management Process: Space Acquisition, a Critique and Evaluation","Change has become the ""status quo"" for all levels of United States' governance; leaders in all sectors must be prepared to rapidly respond to global events such as: natural disasters, humanitarian relief efforts, acts of terrorism, peacekeeping missions, and daily movement of troops and cargo to far flung reaches of the globe. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays an integral role in the successful response to these events wherever and whenever they may happen to occur. It is critical to this country's national security that DOD lead research efforts to maintain the highest levels of defense capabilities in space (including cyber), in the air, on land, and on the sea. The power to meet the challenges of today and those that our country will most certainly face in the future is vital to our role as a world leader. A key element supporting that agenda is The Integrated Defense Acquisition Technology and Logistics Life Cycle Management System. It consists of the Joint Capabilities Integration &amp; Development System, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution and the DOD Acquisition Process. The department acquires major acquisition programs such as, satellites, aircraft, tanks and major information technology systems using this established procedure. For at least the past two years, the DOD acquisition process has suffered major criticism from leadership at all levels of government for its inability to deliver required capability to the war fighter—on time, on schedule, and within budget. The fact we have been fighting three major conflicts simultaneously exacerbates the situation. The good news is that there are many initiatives underway within DOD and the legislative branch to vastly improve the acquisition process. The purpose of this paper is to focus research on just one aspect of DOD's acquisition the relationship between Congress and the DOD Space System acquisition process. It should be stated at the outset that this is a particularly propitious time for the Congress and DOD relationship; this is a time of growth and taking a new look at the ways that they interrelate with each other. This review is intended to examine the relationship from a perspective of social and anthropological theoretical frameworks, with particular emphasis on Symbolic Interactionism's (SI) articulation of the role of human symbolic process in the interactional construction of institutional and individual relationships. This particularized focus derives from the basic understanding that they, DOD and Congress, are rational human problem solvers, and that society is a process of individuals interacting (cooperating, role taking, aligning perspectives and acts, and communicating). In high frequency interactions, institutions, groups and individuals reaffirm constantly emerging structures and resource mediums within clearly understood and partially ambiguous outcomes. Specifically, this responds to the anthropologists' history of investigating and describing high frequency institutional, group and individual relationships. Humans engage in overt and covert actions in the present—recalling lessons of the past, planning for the future, and the dynamic interaction that takes place between them. These theoretical perspectives go a long way to make both functional and dysfunctional elements of this relationship transparent. Ultimately, once discovered and articulated, these elements can be seen to exert an important influence on the direction of individuals, societies, and ultimately on such vital and complex processes as that of the Congress-DOD acquisition process. At this juncture, the two professional involvements of engineering as normally conceived and the recent work of social engineering come together. Without social engineering, the problems of agreement on the complexities of budget, time, and appraisals of advanced military systems run into unnecessary but often lethal blockages where agreement, negotiation, and the smooth settlement of conflicts can render the best of groups' intentions dysfunctional. This analysis provides insight for those practitioners desiring improvements to the overall DOD space acquisition process. This study gives special attention to the ""human aspect"" of this process, as well as proposing an institutional relationship model for use in the DOD/Congress relationship and several of the many complex functions by which they can be evaluated. This investigation uses almost a century of sociological theory embracing the functions of discourse as a major source of evaluative perspective for the shaping of the significant relationships between one organization and another. This study does not represent absolutes but attempts to advance the investigation through research (Geertz, 1973). Previously discovered facts are mobilized, previously developed concepts used, previously formulated hypothesis tried out; but the movement is not from already proven theorems to newly proven ones, it is from awkward fumbling for the most elementary understanding to a supported claim that one has achieved that and surpassed it. A study is an advance if it is more incisive—whatever that may mean—than those that preceded it.

In my dissertation I address the ambiguous encounter between the moral and the commercial economy by looking at the ongoing Transylvanian controversy in Rosia Montana. Examining the ambiguity within the discursive practices (re)producing both Rosia Montana (as an object of commodification) and Rosienii (as subjects) in dichotomous representations, I illustrate how selling or preserving land in the new global economy is not a simple ‘economic’ choice. While the corporate supporters attempt to produce the image of a troubled space in need of aid – thus essentializing what a Rosian means by appealing to a proletarian consciousness of the miner occupation - NGOs are producing the ‘Save Rosia Montana’ campaign by appealing to a pristine/peasantry essence and to the ‘liberal rights’ discourse. While a prevailing narrative among the Rosienii is reiterating motifs of sacred spirituality, all these representations are rather unstable and blurred in everyday life. Interviews, personal stories and quotations of media texts will illustrate how Rosienii are seduced by the various ideological discourses attempting to arrest the experience of Rosia and how ‘partitioning’ their sensible experience is rather contentious. My argument is that resistance is to be viewed aesthetically as it eludes certainty; political subjectivities are mobile and events of subjectification are unstable. The paradoxes of this encounter are important in terms of continuities and similarities between capitalism and the totalitarian experiment of Eastern Europe, making the discourse of ‘post-communism’ more complicated than it is traditionally presented. On the one hand, one can see the Rosia Montana case as a ‘successful social (environmental) movement’ not only because it managed to create ways to block the corporation for almost ten years but also because it attracted the support of many people from all over Romania (and elsewhere) who have become interested in the area and (even) visited it: the call had very much to do with the perception that the corporate project is a mockery and that Romanian politicians are profiting out of it. The 2010 HayFest mirrored the desired alternatives for the region: entitled “Rosia Montana, as a Big Stage”, it gathered people from all over Romania as well as other countries for workshops, political debates, traditional food-shops, eco-entertainment activities, touristic visits etc. On the other hand, the ‘bread and butter’ arguments are widespread too, because of lingering scarcity of (financial) resources; these indeed, make resistance to economic development projects unpalatable. Surely the anxiety and the insecurities Rosienii experience are nothing new in the milieu of human reactions to modernity's disruptions. In the Rosia context, the prevailing feeling is that nothing/no one can offer solutions to ease the pains of these disruptions (‘the state is silent and corrupt’, ‘capitalists only want money in their pocket’). Neither the market nor the state is trusted to address grievances. There is a widespread feeling that either selling of preserving their valuables, they deal with a non-choice. While the formal activism against the corporate project attempts to naturalize its side of the ‘truth’ in contrast with the ‘truth’ exposed by the corporation, the differend of Rosia Montana becomes visible in the stories of Rosienii. Reluctant to being called ‘activists’, their everyday struggle is both reinforcing and subverting the ‘truths’ of this controversy by introducing the ‘variable’ of ambiguity. The personal stories reproduced in this dissertation show that both national feelings of rootedness or the support for corporate mining are not forms of closed ideological engagement (of nationalism or neo-liberalism) manipulated towards some programmatic ends. The narratives of people do not simply reveal anti-modern/anti-industrial sentiments just as they do not reveal some blind credulity in the mantra of the market; they do not simply display allegiance to an ideology or another. Self-identification is volatile and unstable. As my interviews will show, there is a strong sense of living the ‘drama of uncertainty’. Representation of both the space and identities is fluid: there is no fixed Rosia as a discursive space; ‘who is Rosia’ and ‘who are the Rosieni’ is continuously a matter of dispute. There is no intelligible (ideological) discourse to Rosieni's feelings and inner tensions, loyalties being divided and uncertain, contradictory and shifting. Dissensus, rather than consensus, heterogeneity rather than homogeneity characterizes the politics of post-communist Rosia Montana; paying attention to this aesthetic resistance may create free spaces for imagining alternative possibilities.",955181036,,Dissertations & Theses," Velicu, IrinaVelicuIrinaVelicu, Irina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2621194111 , 64379501 , 66569 , 9781267245335 , 3502175 , 3502175", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267245335, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/955181036?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Aesthetics , Globalization , Neoliberalism , Postcommunist , Resistance , Romania",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=To+sell+or+not+to+sell+resistance+neo-liberal+globalization+and+the+aesthetic+post-communist+subject&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Velicu%2C+Irina&amp;isbn=9781267245335&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Soviet “displaced persons” in Europe, 1941–1951","Soviet citizens were the single largest population displaced by the Second World War. However, Soviet DPs are largely unmentioned in histories of the postwar ""displaced persons."" This is partially because of the highly successful postwar repatriation campaign. By February 1946, 95% of displaced Soviet citizens had returned home to the USSR. This was possible, in part, because Soviet citizens genuinely wanted to return home and also because force was used to ensure repatriation. Once identified as Soviet, DPs were transferred to special repatriation camps under direct Soviet authority. Those that did not wish to be repatriated were forced to assume alternative non-Soviet identities or to remain outside the UN camps. These individuals claimed to be Polish, Latvian or ""stateless."" Living on their own, Soviet ""non-returners"" lived in the forests or rented rooms from German farmers. Because they remained largely outside the purview of the Allied forces and UN, the experiences of Soviet ""non-returners"" are largely unknown. This dissertation is a history of Soviet ""displaced persons."" It begins with their displacement during World War II. Nearly three million Soviet POWs and civilians were taken into Nazi Germany to work as forced laborers. Others were enlisted in volunteer units that worked for the military. The failure to capture Stalingrad in 1942-1943 led to a prolonged retreat by German forces from Soviet territories. During this withdrawal, tens of thousands of Soviet citizens were taken west into Europe. Rather than treating this displacement as either forced or voluntary, I discuss displacement as a process, which is composed of multiple migratory events. Given that postwar ""displaced persons"" share a wide diversity of wartime experiences, this earlier history is often excluded from DP histories. By dividing the process of displacement into specific migratory events it is possible to analyze the diversity of wartime movements and their selective effects on migrant populations. After the war, displaced civilians were placed in military ""assembly centers."" The initial registration of DPs was based on one's claimed nationality. No proof of identity was required, making it possible for large numbers of Soviet DPs to become ""Polish"" or ""stateless"" in UN statistics. Allied personnel followed an inconsistent ""field policy"" in regard to forced repatriation and even assisted Soviet citizens that did not want to return home. Aware of these efforts to misidentify DPs, Soviet officers inspected camps, compiled lists of suspected Soviet citizens and fought for their return. They actively pursued anti-Soviet DPs as collaborators in the hope that others would return home if ""fascist"" influence could be countered. Except in cases of voluntary return, these efforts were largely unsuccessful. In late 1946, it became possible for Soviet DPs to become refugees. Refugee status created a ""stateless"" person who could then travel outside Europe using papers issued by the IRO. While Soviet delegates at the UN argued for the preservation of prewar conventions, American and British delegates introduced a new definition of refugees as victims of persecution. After extensive negotiations, this definition was entered into the constitution of the International Refugee Organization in December 1946. Thereafter, it was possible for Soviet DPs to claim asylum as refugees and to resettle outside Europe. In sum, approximately 100,000 Soviet DPs were able to escape from forced repatriation. The history of this group lends important insights into the active role played by ""displaced persons"" as they interacted with aid agencies, military officials and the UN. Whether living without documents or using a false identity in the camps, Soviet ""non-returners"" lived outside the law. Because Soviet DPs were forced outside legality, their history illuminates several important aspects of the postwar refugee crisis. First of all, not all ""displaced persons"" registered with the UN. A significant population of undocumented DPs lived in postwar Europe. Additionally, a large component of DPs, as much as one third, did not live in the camps. These ""free-living"" DPs lived and worked independently. Finally, the IRO did not resettle a substantial number of registered IRO refugees. These findings suggest the need for a reevaluation of the postwar history of ""displaced persons."" While the Allied forced and UNRRA attempted to manage the postwar refugee crisis, they often met resistance from ""displaced persons"" who were not eager to see themselves as victims in need. This study, unlike works that highlight the isolation of ""displaced persons"" from surrounding societies and their dependence on the UN for assistance, records the active role played by DPs as they traveled in search of family, sought employment and general well-being. DPs manipulated their identities to join communities or to evade forced repatriation. They negotiated social and political categories in ways that met their self-interest.

Beyond giving an overview of the films or directors already labeled ""realist"" in general histories of Japanese cinema, it explores how the emergence of the cinematic apparatus at the end of nineteenth century and its subsequent development into a distinct form of art and mass entertainment altered the ways in which Japanese people dealt with the issues of realism at large. Where earlier studies have treated the creation of theory, or systematic knowledge about the given object, as the exclusive domain of the West, I intend to illuminate the work of Japanese critics and thinkers who, like their Western counterparts, strove to theorize their speculations about social, cultural, and perceptual changes engendered by the global circulation of film and its major theories. A blend of archival research and close readings of individual texts, this study mainly considers five types of realism—Naturalism, machine realism, textual realism, epistemological realism, and phenomenological realism—as they developed with Japanese cinema's long struggle with the truly elusive nature of realism as a critical concept. My investigation into the rich but mostly neglected tradition of Japanese realist film aesthetics provides a critical point of comparison for current scholarship on the historical conjunction between realism and world cinema. Along the same line, ""Realities that Matter"" aims to offer a more accurate an dynamic history of cultural exchanges between the West and non-West, a history in which Japanese cinema no longer plays a role of an ideal ""Other"" of European and Hollywood classical filmmaking. Beginning with the introduction of Naturalism in the 1910s, each chapter reveals how Japanese filmmakers and critics of the following decades developed their own conceptions of cinematic realism in response to the latest trends in critical theories and film practice imported from abroad. In Chapter 2, I look into the art historian Itagaki Takao's concept of ""machine realism,"" which he proposed in the late I 920s by drawing upon the writings of contemporary European modernists such as László Moholy-Nagy, Le Corbusier, and Dziga Vertov; Chapters 3 and 4 provide detailed accounts of the reactions of Japanese cinema to the emergence of realist film schools in 1930s Europe, including French poetic realism, Soviet socialist realism, and the British Documentary Film Movement; and Chapter 5 scrutinizes a group of Japanese thinkers of the early 1940s who developed a theory of phenomenological realism under the strong influence of Henri Bergson. Considering these instances in detail, this study presents the historical development of Japanese realist film theory and practice as part of a genuinely modern and global phenomenon of the twentieth century. Japanese cinema's take on the issues of realism was not always on par with its Western counterparts. But as I argue repeatedly in the following pages, such deviations should not be read as Japanese filmmakers and theorists' lack of knowledge about the things happening outside the country but rather as their conscious and critical response to the alleged ""universality"" of Western discourse.",1038158980,,Dissertations & Theses," Yamamoto, NaokiYamamotoNaokiYamamoto, Naoki", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2753880531 , 71565142 , 66569 , 9781267574237 , 3525380 , 3525380", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267574237, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038158980?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Asian Studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , 20th century , Film , Film theory , Japan , Japanese cinema , Modernism , Realism , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Realities+That+Matter%3A+The+Development+of+Realist+Film+Theory+and+Practice+in+Japan%2C+1895-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yamamoto%2C+Naoki&amp;isbn=9781267574237&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Barriers and limitations to expanded participation in local food systems, Cottonwood, Arizona","The examination of industrialized, global food models is an urgent and growing object of scholarship. Many communities throughout the world are seeking to re-localize their food sources in order to help the environment, secure local food availability, and build social capital within their communities. The City of Cottonwood, situated in the Verde Valley in central Arizona boasts long growing seasons and many food bearing desert plants. The Verde Valley sits in a plain braided with rivers both seasonal and perennial. In addition, ancient lakes have left some of the most desired soil conditions found in the world (Tabor &amp; Thornbur, 1991). However, dominance of the industrialized food system differs little in this potential bread basket from that of barren and urban communities throughout the country. Despite Cottonwood.s most advantageous agricultural conditions, the people of the area suffer from food insecurity at some of the highest rates in the nation (Food Research and Action Center, 2011), and participation in local food activity is observed to be far less than many communities. The central question this study explores is What are the barriers that inhibit the development of sustainable local agriculture in Cottonwood? Further, What are the prevailing cultural and perceptual hindrances to establishing and supporting a localized food system? A comparative assessment of three other Arizona communities and their approaches to local food will identify elements and patterns for the establishment of an effective local food system. The research will identify the structural barriers to localized agriculture such as laws, climates and resources. The analysis will examine how local histories, demographics, personal values and cultural norms also impact participation in local food movements. Rapid Assessment Response and Evaluation (RARE) techniques are used to compile survey data to uncover how the general agricultural barriers impact citizens as well as how cultural-perceptual barriers contribute to the current lack of locally-focused agricultural practices in Cottonwood. Theories of civic engagement (Putnam, 2000), rationalization, McDonaldization (Ritzer, 2004) and Cultural Creatives (Ray &amp; Anderson, 2000) will aide in analyzing these findings. This work hopes to illuminate needed changes to community assets and provide suggestions as to how identified barriers can be overcome.",1039149399,,Dissertations & Theses," Gottschalk, Nancy B.GottschalkB.NancyGottschalk, Nancy B.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2758865111 , 71700162 , 66569 , 9781267587206 , 1517293 , 1517293", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267587206, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1039149399?accountid=14496," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0473 Agriculture , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0473 Agriculture , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0473 Agriculture , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability",," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0473 Agriculture , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," Behavioral psychology , Agriculture , Public policy , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Psychology , Arizona , Civic engagement , Community , Cottonwood , Local food , Social change",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Barriers+and+limitations+to+expanded+participation+in+local+food+systems%2C+Cottonwood%2C+Arizona&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gottschalk%2C+Nancy+B.&amp;isbn=9781267587206&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Theology and the Kinesthetic Imagination: A Case Study of Jonathan Edwards in the Circum-Atlantic World,"This dissertation explores bodily gesture as a source of theological knowledge, using as a case study the historical context and theology of colonial North American theologian Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758). The project has a two-fold aim: a recontextualization of Edwards in discourses about the making of modernity in the circum-Atlantic world; and, more suggestively, a constructive appraisal of bodily gesture, beauty, and desire as sources for Christian theology. Theologians in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have ""rediscovered"" the body, aesthetics, and desire as sources of theological knowledge. The emphasis on beauty, body, and desire is often pitted against the hyper-rational subject assumed in post-Enlightenment Protestant European and American theologies. This project returns to a particular moment in the history of Protestant Christian theology and its collusion with the creation of this modern, rational subject: the publically rehearsed theological debates regarding the series of 18 th century colonial and European revivals known as the Great Awakening. A central point of contention in the debates between revivalists, of whom Edwards was the primary public champion, and detractors of the revivals was the unruly body of those seized with ""the new birth."" Under the throes of the spirit, people convulsed, wept, shouted fainted, leapt, and even levitated. For some, these bodily manifestations were signs of ""a divine and supernatural light"" infused in the soul, for others, dear proof of irrationality and dangerous enthusiasm. Edwards own view of bodily knowledge was itself vexed. He labored to evoke these ecstatic bodily performances in his sermon events, defended his parishioners from charges of excess and mental instability, and crafted an intricate theological scaffolding to account for these affective and bodily realities in terms he hoped would both be faithful to orthodox Calvinism and convincing according to the logic of the new science he learned from Newton and Locke. At the same time, he was beholden to a skeptical view of the body learned from that same new science. This tension in Edwards' body theology is enlivened in conversation with performance theory, particularly alongside performance concepts of ""scenario,"" ""repertoire,"" and ""kinesthetic imagination."" I borrow the term kinesthetic imagination from performance and dance theory, where it describes a convergence of imagination and memory in bodily movement. I describe Edwards's revival corpus as a repertoire that creates scenarios that set in motion kinesthetic imagination to counter the rational, self-determining subject that was being created in the confluence of early Enlightenment philosophy and early global capitalism in the circum-Atlantic world. In other words, the body's ecstasy called forth in revival sermon events offers an alternative theological history, one that lives not in written doctrine so much as in bodily gesture and movement. Unruly as bodily gestures are, they escape the bounds of ecclesial control, appearing in various cultural locations, and creating theological meaning as they exert influence on the subjects that enact them. Kinesthetic imagination offers a way to understand this bodily knowledge not only in terms of individual experience, but also as a way of describing the intersection of theological meaning with broader culture as it is traced through bodily movement. The first chapter frames the key theoretical terms of my project drawn from performance theory, situating the discussion in the ongoing theological conversation about the body's role as a theological source, and suggesting why Edwards and the 18 th century revivals are a useful case study. I then turn to Edwards's context in particular, describing his location in the circum-Atlantic world as one marked by the exchange of goods and ideas in circulation from Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and the Americas that created the material conditions for modernity. Situating Edwards in the circum-Atlantic reframes his theological project as one deeply indebted to the material, social, and cultural forces of early global capitalism and the creation of a new modern subject forged in the challenge to traditional understandings of epistemology, authority, and authenticity. Within this frame, I examine his revival sermons in the third chapter, reading them as scripts in a repertoire that call forth two emotional registers: beauty and terror. Beauty and terror are twin sides of Edwards's concept of reality and together shape the sensibility he hoped to form in his parishioners, a sense of belonging to the cosmic whole. This sensibility was enacted in the bodily scenarios his preaching elicited and I devote my fourth chapter to an analysis of the body in revival writings and how those bodily movements foster a kinesthetic imagination. I conclude with an epilogue, exploring how this kinesthetic imagination carries theological meaning in the present.",1039561132,,Dissertations & Theses," Reklis, Kathryn MarieReklisMarieKathrynReklis, Kathryn Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2760777071 , 71775682 , 66569 , 9781267577085 , 3525298 , 3525298", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267577085, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1039561132?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology"," Religious history , American history , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Atlantic world , Circum-Atlantic , Edwards, Jonathan , Kinesthetic imagination , Modernity , Performance theory",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Theology+and+the+Kinesthetic+Imagination%3A+A+Case+Study+of+Jonathan+Edwards+in+the+Circum-Atlantic+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reklis%2C+Kathryn+Marie&amp;isbn=9781267577085&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The warp of a nation: The exhibition and circulation of Nigerien art, 1920–present","Art education and exposition of the colonial and immediate post-independence eras continue to influence how art in Niger is made, exchanged, and displayed. One form of contemporary Nigerien art that mostly clearly demonstrates this is weaving, and other relevant media include leatherwork, metalwork, embroidery, and fashion design. This dissertation includes the recording of aesthetic and business expertise of artisans, the documentation of various ways of navigating the global marketplace, and analysis of the historical resonances in contemporary Nigerien arts exposition and trade. Of particular importance are the nature of the decisions that lead to aesthetic change, and what meanings are ascribed to old and new motifs. To be sure, art pedagogies, business structures, and museum spaces have impacted Nigerien artisans' aesthetic and business choices in specific ways. In turn, artisans' work affects the institutions and networks in which they operate. The Musée National Boubou Hama du Niger, founded in 1959, offers a compelling example of the appropriation of a European institutional form that was then transformed and given new meaning by Africans. The movements of artisans and the objects they make underscore the global history of this museum, and make the interpretation of these travels key to the understanding of its art and the artisans it houses. The first chapter foregrounds an analysis of the Musée National Boubou Hama du Niger. In Chapter Two, I focus on the work of weavers in Niger from the 1950s until the 1980s. In Chapter Three, I seek out artisans’ perspectives and artworks’ social lives in a history of the educational and exhibitionary projects of the Afrique Occidentale Française government in the 1930s and 1940s, a period that left lasting effects on formal and non-formal artisanal education in Niger. Chapter Four traces the changes in aesthetics, organizations, and education that artisans have instigated, encountered, and altered from the 1970s to the present. Chapter Five historically and globally contextualizes contemporary Nigerien fashion, especially that related to the biannual Festival Internationale de la Mode Africaine. The dissertation concludes with a call for broad access to arts education that uses Freirian pedagogy to teach rigorous hand skills and related conceptual content in Niger.",1115316386,,Dissertations & Theses," Gilvin, Amanda KayGilvinKayAmandaGilvin, Amanda Kay", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2799357051 , 69229552 , 66569 , 9781267716514 , 3530971 , 3530971", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267716514, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1115316386?accountid=14496," 0273 Art education , 0377 Art history , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0730 Museum studies"," 0273 Art education , 0377 Art history , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0730 Museum studies"," 0273 Art education , 0377 Art history , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0730 Museum studies",," 0273 Art education , 0377 Art history , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0730 Museum studies"," Art education , Art history , Sub Saharan Africa Studies , Museum studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Education , Artisans , Exhibition , Fashion , Museology , Niger , Textiles",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+warp+of+a+nation%3A+The+exhibition+and+circulation+of+Nigerien+art%2C+1920%E2%80%93present&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gilvin%2C+Amanda+Kay&amp;isbn=9781267716514&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The experiences of homeschool mothers,"The homeschooling movement is an alternative education choice that continues to grow in the United States. Research is available on how well homeschooled students do academically and even socially, yet little research has been done on their primary teachers, usually the mother. The studies that have included information on the mothers often focus on Christian homeschool families. This study looked at six homeschooling mothers and asked, ""What is the nature of homeschool mothers' experiences, specifically for those homeschooling mothers who indicate their primary reason for homeschooling is not based on their religious beliefs?"" An examination of this question provided insight into the joys and challenges that homeschool mothers face during their journey. Topic areas of interest included how homeschool mothers make the decision to homeschool, the style of homeschooling they use, how they cope with the day-to-day teaching of their children, whether or not they experience isolation, and the use of networks to support and sustain them as individuals, teachers, and mothers. An exploratory qualitative research design was used for this study. This design utilized case study method to frame the research study while incorporating aspects of ethnography and autoethnography to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of homeschool mothers. Data was collected from each participant in the form of three interviews, one focus group meeting, one informal observation (mothers-night-out) of the focus group, and visual images in the form of drawings. Informal observations were conducted during each interview and recorded as field notes. Elements of autoethnography via a memory log and memos reflecting my own experience of homeschooling four children for over 20 years were incorporated into the study. Management of the data took place in QSR International's NVivo 9 software (NVivo) which provided tools to aid in organization and continual analysis of data. The use of NVivo allowed the data to be categorized in a manner that assisted in the recognition of trends and themes within the data. NVivo did not do the analysis, but allowed me to organize the data to provide access to information that have relationships to each other. Subjectivity was addressed by recognizing my own bias towards homeschooling through reflexive memos and through feedback from my committee members and fellow doctoral students in my dissertation seminar. There were several key findings from this study. The reasons to homeschool were varied and included a desire for more time together as a family, public and private schools not meeting the educational and/or social needs of the children, and children requesting to be homeschooled. The literature available does not address homeschooling from the perspective of being sought by the child. The style of homeschooling utilized by the participants was primarily unschooling; the findings indicated that how they defined unschooling varied considerably. Participants were wary of being characterized as radical unschoolers and expressed concern over indicating to others that they unschooled, so as not to be confused with radical unschoolers. Half of the participants experienced community isolation and this study considered methods to reduce isolation in the future. Findings in the area of support networks revealed that a lack of family support negatively impacted the homeschool mothers' experience and was the support most desired by the participants. Major sources of support came from spouses and other homeschool mothers. The findings from this study explored how homeschool mothers sustained themselves and indicated that personal satisfaction derived from teaching their children was the primary source of their satisfaction and self-efficacy. The participants also used a variety of hobbies to sustain them as individuals that included volunteering, reading, gardening, and cooking. Homeschooling continues to be a growing movement in the area of alternative education choices. The number of families who are choosing to homeschool their children has increased substantially in the last ten years. In 2007, a report by the National Center for Education Statistics indicated 1.5 million students were homeschooled (Bielek, 2008). A study by Ray (2011) found 2.04 million students being homeschooled in the United States and that the rate of growth in homeschooling is higher than the growth rate of students entering schools. The growth in homeschooling calls for further research on why more parents are choosing to homeschool and what are their experiences while homeschooling their children. As more parents make the decision to homeschool, further insight into the topic of homeschooling mothers may be of interest to educators to further their understanding of the homeschool movement.",1176491871,,Dissertations & Theses," Finch, Deborah D.FinchD.DeborahFinch, Deborah D.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2820150491 , 73802742 , 66569 , 9781267761514 , 3532770 , 3532770", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267761514, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1176491871?accountid=14496," 0340 Educational sociology , 0628 Individual & family studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0628 Individual & family studies"," 0340 Educational sociology , 0628 Individual & family studies",," 0340 Educational sociology , 0628 Individual & family studies"," Educational sociology , Individual & family studies"," Social sciences , Education , Alternative education , Homeschooling , Mothers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+experiences+of+homeschool+mothers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Finch%2C+Deborah+D.&amp;isbn=9781267761514&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Stuckism, punk attitude and fine art practice: parallels and similarities","My doctoral project, researched between 2006 And 2011, asks if the rapidly expanding art movement known as Stuckism has an approach that can be related to Punk ‘attitude’ in the late 1970s. Theorists of youth-based subcultures have extensively explored the notion of generational attitude (Hebdige 1979, Sabin, 1999) and the ambition of this PhD has been, from the start, to describe the development of Stuckism in terms associated with the rise of Punk within my own generation. As an active member of the original Stuckist group I have had to engage with the same sense of iconoclastic hostility that played such an important role during my time as a Punk musician from 1977 to the present. Thus the research I discuss in this thesis has been shaped by a set of aims and objectives that, firstly, address the similarities and parallels between two distinct historical moments and, secondly, embrace the fact that I am undertaking my research from within the subject group as it coheres into a viable force in the international arts scene. The parallel between Punk and Stuckism may not be immediately obvious for historians or critics. Both are separated in time as distinct episodes in our current cultural story (Bech Poulson, 2005; Evans, 2000) and both are associated with different art forms that address contrasting socio-cultural audiences. Whilst Punk operated, first and foremost, in the context of popular music, Stuckism is a creature of the visual arts, a response to dominant trends amongst gallery and museum directors rather than an appeal to radicalized, media-oriented youth. However, I am not able to examine this contrast from a retrospective point of view and so have built my methodological approach on the hope that the ‘narrative turn’ in contemporary social studies and cultural anthropology (Marcus &amp; Fischer, 1984) offers me a persuasive mechanism for capturing the ongoing development of my practice as a painter with Stuckist and Punk affiliations. As my creative activities have contributed to the idea of Stuckism I have explored how the narratives of identity I associate with Punk attitude have helped form the identity of the group. Here my initial model was research on the narrative construction of identity in professional or social domains described by Czarniawska (2004). However, as I accumulated and published accounts of Stuckism using my growing archive of interviews with other artists in the group (Lynn, 2006) I began to use methodological procedures suggested by Ochs &amp; Capps (2001) to develop a system of interpretation that drew out, I felt, many commonalities with the Punk movement.

While most historians dismiss imperial history's development as uneventful or as a straightforward symptom of a vast ruling impulse, private papers and university records throughout the UK and North America reveal a much more compelling reality. Scholars, politicians and journalists were a driving force in conceptualizing what the British empire was and what it ought to become. Their struggles to mold the study of imperial history in response to contemporary currents and crises fatefully informed the organized knowledge, institutions and very worldviews through which Britons ultimately would negotiate world war and decolonization in the twentieth century. This dissertation argues that the impetus for the rise of imperial history from the 1880s was to promote the colonies of white settlement and banish from concern vast portions of the empire in Asia and Africa. By relegating non-white subject populations to a different and closed temporal realm, historians, public sages and politicians in Britain lent scientific gravity to the project of building an Anglo-Saxon world union linked by a common and exclusive conception of settler citizenship. The currency and contentiousness of this vision only swelled in subsequent decades, in response to the Boer War and Edwardian political economic controversies. But from 1912 onward, new forms of colonial crisis—namely, nationalist movements in India and Africa and violent resistance to discriminatory labor and migration systems in the wider British world—brought the politics of alien rule to the forefront for a new generation of imperial and historical theorists. The First World War accelerated this confrontation, throwing supposedly distinct Anglo-Saxon and dependent populations together in one moral and historical frame. From a new position of authority conferred by wartime information politics, leading interwar thinkers responded by promising a formula that would bring non-white peoples into the calculus of international reconstruction. They did so, however, by invoking ideals of localism and settler citizenship that largely doomed the so-called transfer of power, when it came, to manifest as a matter of presentation and conformity rather than as an honest dialogue about the limits of political transformation and the realities of social, economic and cultural strife. This shift in historical thought, in turn, exposed an enduring tension between a language of rights on one hand, and a racism based on historical difference, on the other, which had developed over the course of a century and would persist in British politics and attitudes past the end of formal rule. All told, these events played out in the networking, correspondence, patronage, policymaking and history-writing of three generations of Britons who sought to intervene decisively in the most pressing social and moral debates of their day, and who plotted their destiny based on beliefs about the past. The emergence and practice of imperial history thus informed, and in many ways determined, the fractured trajectory of the modern British empire.",1269522626,,Dissertations & Theses," Behm, Amanda L.BehmL.AmandaBehm, Amanda L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2865892661 , 74795052 , 66569 , 9781267851253 , 3535256 , 3535256", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267851253, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1269522626?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0578 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0520 Education history , 0578 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0520 Education history , 0578 History , 0582 Modern history",," 0520 Education history , 0578 History , 0582 Modern history"," Education history , History , Modern history"," Social sciences , Education , British Empire , Imperial history , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imperial+history+in+Britain%2C+1880%E2%80%931940%3A+Pasts%2C+politics+and+the+making+of+a+field&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Behm%2C+Amanda+L.&amp;isbn=9781267851253&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Determining the Most Common Roles of Secondary Online Teachers,"Enrollment in online education continues to grown nationally, with a majority of the growth occurring at the secondary level. The state of Oregon, however, does not currently have an endorsement in online education or required training for online teachers. In order to identify the training needs for online secondary school teachers, data were collected from secondary level teachers working at a web academy. This quantitative study used a preestablished instrument in order to answer the research question regarding the roles secondary online teachers most commonly fill in their online classes. The sample consisted of 10 current secondary level instructors who teach online. The participants were asked to rank the instructional roles using a ranking survey developed by the International Board of Standards for Training Performance and Instruction. Role scores were averaged across participants, and these averaged scores were then ranked to determine that the two most common roles were that of advisor and evaluator. These results were used to develop a project consisting of an online course with five modules designed to increase participants' understanding of one of the most common roles, evaluator. Throughout the course participants will learn multiple strategies for assessing student learning and reasons why each strategy may be appropriate or inappropriate for assessing student learning. This study and the project that was developed contributes to social change by initiating a thorough understanding of effective practices and training for K-12 online teachers. Only after this field of research has been developed and practiced can a movement for effectively training and certifying K-12 online teachers may take root and lead to excellence in K-12 online education.",1272365465,,Dissertations & Theses," Farrens, Shawn ChristopherFarrensChristopherShawnFarrens, Shawn Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2873808181 , 66995832 , 66569 , 9781267820877 , 3547421 , 3547421", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267820877, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1272365465?accountid=14496," 0514 School administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology"," 0514 School administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology"," 0514 School administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology",," 0514 School administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology"," School administration , Secondary education , Educational technology"," Education , Distance education or online education , Online teacher roles or distance education teacher roles , Online teacher training or distance education teacher training , Online teaching or distance education teaching , Secondary online education or secondary distance education , Teacher roles",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Determining+the+Most+Common+Roles+of+Secondary+Online+Teachers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Farrens%2C+Shawn+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781267820877&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An anthropological study of health activism in western India.,"This thesis is an ethnographic account of a community of activists in western India.  Taking as its focus the relationship between reality and representation in the field of activism, the thesis develops new ways of analysing activism by drawing on contemporary scholarship on the study of narratives and controversy.  Fieldwork over 20 months (2007-2009) was multi-sited.  Although much of it was carried out in the city of Pune and adivasi (tribal) areas of Thane district in the state of Maharashtra, the thesis focuses on the national and international connections of activists based at these sites, in particular their links with the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (People’s Health Movement). The thesis is concerned with the practices of activists in relation to other activists.  It explores how the narratives of activists about each other are mutually determined, describing the framework within which this mutual definition takes place as an ‘economy of stances’. The thesis examines the way in which these narratives are productive and useful for their narrators.  Each chapter uses specific ethnographic data to develop this argument, documenting the activists’ rights-based campaign work, their involvement with the government’s National Rural Health Mission, and the distinctions they make between different types of social action. Each chapter finds different ways to problematise the categories used by activists, and examines how activists are constantly engaged in the work of managing the boundaries between the following: funded activities and actors versus voluntary ones; working with or against the government; service delivery versus campaign activities.  Managing the boundaries between these categories is crucial to the activists: their ability to do what they do depends on it.  This thesis challenges the idea that activist categories are peripheral to activism or can be taken for granted, and shows they are central to how activism works.",1327097591,,Dissertations & Theses," Donegan, B.M.DoneganB.M.Donegan, B.M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2945285481 , 74053632 , 101309 , U580332 , U580332", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1327097591?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAIU580332 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+anthropological+study+of+health+activism+in+western+India.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Donegan%2C+B.M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Bankruptcy prediction of companies in the retail-apparel industry using data envelopment analysis,"Since 2008, the world has been in recession. As daily news outlets report, this crisis has prompted many small businesses and large corporations to file for bankruptcy, which has grave global social implications. Despite government intervention and incentives to stimulate the economy that have put nations in hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, and have reduced the prime rates to almost zero, efforts to combat the increase in unemployment rate as well as the decrease in discretionary income have been troublesome. It is a vicious cycle: consumers are apprehensive of spending due to the instability of their jobs and ensuing personal financial problems; businesses are weary from the lack of revenue and are forced to tighten their operations which likely translates to layoffs; and so on. Cautious movement of cash flows are rooted in and influenced by the psychology of the players (stakeholders) of the game (society). Understandably, the complexity of this economic fallout is the subject of much attention. And while the markets have recovered much of the lost ground as of late, there is still great opportunity to learn about all the possible factors of this recession, in anticipation of and bracing for one more downturn before we emerge from this crisis. In fact, there is no time like today more appropriate for research in bankruptcy prediction because of its relevance, and in an age where documentation is highly encouraged and often mandated by law, the amount and accessibility of data is paramount – an academic’s paradise! The main objective of this thesis was to develop a model supported by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to predict the likelihood of failure of US companies in the retail-apparel industry based on information available from annual reports – specifically from financial statements and their corresponding Notes, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and Auditor’s Report. It was hypothesized that the inclusion of variables which reflect managerial decision-making and economic factors would enhance the predictive power of current mathematical models that consider financial data exclusively. With a unique and comprehensive dataset of 85 companies, new metrics based on different aspects of the annual reports were created then combined with a slacks-based measure of efficiency DEA model and modified layering classification technique to capture the multidimensional complexity of bankruptcy. This approach proved to be an effective prediction tool, separating companies with a high risk of bankruptcy from those that were healthy, with a reliable accuracy of 80% – an improvement over the widely-used Altman bankruptcy model having 70%, 58% and 50% accuracy when predicting cases today, from one year back and from two years back, respectively. It also provides a probability of bankruptcy based on a second order polynomial function in addition to targets for improvement, and was designed to be easily adapted for analysis of other industries. Finally, the contributions of this thesis benefit creditors with better risk assessment, owners with time to improve current operations as to avoid failure altogether, as well as investors with information on which healthy companies to invest in and which unhealthy companies to short.",1330319162,,Dissertations & Theses," Kingyens, Angela Tsui-Yin TranKingyensTsui-Yin TranAngelaKingyens, Angela Tsui-Yin Tran", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2949072481 , 76874832 , 66569 , 9780494794746 , NR79474 , NR79474", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494794746, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1330319162?accountid=14496," 0546 Industrial engineering , 0796 Operations research"," 0546 Industrial engineering , 0796 Operations research"," 0546 Industrial engineering , 0796 Operations research",," 0546 Industrial engineering , 0796 Operations research"," Industrial engineering , Operations research"," Applied sciences , Bankruptcy prediction , Data envelopment analysis , Prime rates , Retail-apparel",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bankruptcy+prediction+of+companies+in+the+retail-apparel+industry+using+data+envelopment+analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kingyens%2C+Angela+Tsui-Yin+Tran&amp;isbn=9780494794746&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Use of evidence-based practice resources and empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder among university counseling center psychologists,"In the present study, an attempt was made to determine the degree to which psychologists at college and university counseling centers (UCCs) utilized empirically supported treatments with their posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) clients. In addition, an attempt was made to determine how frequently UCC psychologists utilized a number of evidence-based practice resources with a wide range of clients. The Trauma Practices Questionnaire (Craig &amp; Sprang, 2009, 2010; Sprang &amp; Craig, 2007), the author-generated Treatment Approaches Routinely Utilized with PTSD Clients Questionnaire, the Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (modeled after a survey by Mullen &amp; Bacon, 2006), and the author-generated Demographic and Professional Information Questionnaire were administered on an Internet survey website to participants recruited through advertising on a social networking website or contacted via email. One hundred and ten participants, including 83 women and 27 men, were included in the final results. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Least Significant Difference post-hoc tests showed significant differences between psychologists' utilization of cognitive therapy (CT), behavioral therapy (BT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) with PTSD clients. A chi-square goodness of fit test showed that the majority of psychologists did not regularly utilize exposure therapy with their PTSD clients. In addition, a chi-square goodness of fit test indicated that the majority of psychologists rarely utilized treatment manuals with a wide range of clients. Lastly, chi-square goodness of fit tests showed that a significant proportion of psychologists did not refer to the practice guidelines from the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) when treating PTSD clients, but that a much higher percentage of psychologists had utilized at least one set of practice guidelines over the course of their career.",1340881563,,Dissertations & Theses," Juel, Morgen JorayJuelJorayMorgenJuel, Morgen Joray", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2952743691 , 71195872 , 66569 , 9781303015946 , 3538771 , 3538771", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781303015946, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1340881563?accountid=14496," 0519 School counseling , 0603 Counseling Psychology , 0745 Higher education"," 0519 School counseling , 0603 Counseling Psychology , 0745 Higher education"," 0519 School counseling , 0603 Counseling Psychology , 0745 Higher education",," 0519 School counseling , 0603 Counseling Psychology , 0745 Higher education"," School counseling , Counseling Psychology , Higher education"," Psychology , Education , College students , Empirically supported treatments , Evidence-based practice (EBP) , Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , Trauma , University counseling center",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Use+of+evidence-based+practice+resources+and+empirically+supported+treatments+for+posttraumatic+stress+disorder+among+university+counseling+center+psychologists&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Juel%2C+Morgen+Joray&amp;isbn=9781303015946&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Entre cohésions et divisions: Les relations entre femmes auteures en France et en Italie (1770–1840),"This thesis documents, catalogues, and analyses relationships between female authors in France and Italy, and between French women and Italian women, from 1770 to 1840. It results from a study of the correspondence and published works of twelve women authors (Anne-Marie de Beaufort d'Hautpoul, Sophie Gay, Félicité de Genlis, Marie-Émilie de Montanclos, Constance Pipelet Salm, Germaine de Staël, Teresa Bandettini, Elisabetta Caminer, Carolina Lattanzi, Diodata Saluzzo, Fortunata Sulgher Fantastici, and Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi) over the course of a period marked by important developments in print culture, the significant involvement of women in the querelle des femmes, and the increased presence of women authors. These transformations, together with the international political upheaval caused by the French Revolution, saw attacks on female authorship pursued with increased vigour. The relationships between women authors within such a context illustrate the challenges faced in implementing a “common action” aimed at defending a female cause (that of female authors) before the advent of the feminist movement. Often described as either “rivals” or “sisters”, this study demonstrates that the nature of relationships between women in this period was in fact far more complex. On the one hand, the community of female authors examined was marked by a certain degree of cohesion. These writers had wide-ranging networks of contacts, and could rely on each other for support in times of crisis. They constructed female literary genealogies and deconstructed the discourse used by others in reference to their community, particularly that relating to the “exceptionality” of and “rivalry” between women authors. On the other hand, significant differences also ran across the membership of these networks, notably in terms of nationality, political opinions, and the position each woman occupied within literary circles. Over and above these social and political divisions, this thesis illustrates the difficulties women faced in reconciling their individual interests (the advancement of their own careers, the divisive impact of their multiple identities with the cohesion of their sex/gender) with those of the collective (legitimizing female authorship). In short, this study examines the ways in which female authors recognized the importance of their community and faced the challenges of maintaining its cohesion, at a time when not only literary activity, but also the political and cultural context in which it was framed, were undergoing great transformation.",1353202263,,Dissertations & Theses," Lampron, Eve-MarieLampronEve-MarieLampron, Eve-Marie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2974841671 , 74233942 , 66569 , 9780494976395 , NR97639 , NR97639", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494976395, French, French,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1353202263?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0335 European history , 0453 Womens studies"," Modern literature , European history , Womens studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Ecrivaines , Feminism , Feminisme , Femmes , France , Italie , Italy , Relations , Sociabilite , Sociability , Strategies , Women writers , XIXe siecle , XVIIIe siecle",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Entre+coh%C3%A9sions+et+divisions%3A+Les+relations+entre+femmes+auteures+en+France+et+en+Italie+%281770%E2%80%931840%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lampron%2C+Eve-Marie&amp;isbn=9780494976395&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A history of the uk renewable energy programme, 1974-88: some social, political, and economic aspects","Following the global oil crisis of October 1973 the UK government funded and administered a range of R&amp;D programmes in renewable energy. Despite the discoveries of large deposits of oil and gas in the North Sea during the late 1960s and continuing faith in nuclear energy the government was keen to explore the potential of renewable energy as what it described as an ‘insurance technology’. This thesis examines the creation and evolution of the UK renewable energy programme from 1974 until its demise prior to the privatisation of the UK’s nationalised energy industries in the late 1980s. The thesis shows the important role that social movements - in this case, the new environmentalism - played in the promotion of renewable energy in the UK. This will suggest that the programme can be seen in some senses as a tokenistic gesture by the government acting within the uncertain political, social, and economic landscape of the 1970s. This thesis shows that government decisions on renewable energy were continually driven by socio-political factors which overwhelmed the unreliable economic case for renewables at that time. This is achieved by a close historical account of the two key elements of the wider programme: the Wave Energy Programme and the Wind Energy Programme. Using a mix of the existing literature, historical archive and interviews this thesis builds a historical account of renewable energy R&amp;D in the UK between 1974 and 1988.",1414975488,,Dissertations & Theses," Wilson, John CampbellWilsonCampbellJohnWilson, John Campbell", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031651151 , 80731842 , 101309 , U588419 , U588419 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3121/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1414975488?accountid=14496, 0509 Economic history, 0509 Economic history, 0509 Economic history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0509 Economic history, Economic history," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3121/ , (UMI)AAIU588419 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+history+of+the+uk+renewable+energy+programme%2C+1974-88%3A+some+social%2C+political%2C+and+economic+aspects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilson%2C+John+Campbell&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The bondo secret society: female circumcision and the sierra leonean state,"This thesis explores the place of the Bondo secret society, whose precondition for membership is female genital cutting (FGC), in Sierra Leone’s post-war politics. The Bondo society is considered a repository of gendered knowledge that bestows members with significant forms of power in the local social context. Members, especially Bondo society leaders, are dedicated to the continued practice of FGC even amidst calls for its eradication. The Bondo is much sought after and overwhelmingly supported by the political elite due to the role it plays in ordering community life and its position as the depository of cultural repertoires (Swidler, 2001:24). Most women gravitate towards the Bondo who also use it to shape and reshape their identity. For example, as part of post war recovery, I argue, the Bondo was employed by political actors to legitimate and extend the hegemony of political movements. This analysis, therefore, examines the complicated interplay of power between politicians and the Bondo society members in the context of an international outcry against the practice of FGC. The thesis argues that the Bondo society leaders are keen to maintain the status quo because of the forms of power accessible to them in the local socio-economic and political context. Faced with an over-arching discourse of eradication and change concerning the FGC procedure, the Bondo society has in turn fashioned a counter-discourse framed in terms of “defending traditional culture” to forestall changes that could affect the “privileges” they access. I explore the tensions of this situation in this thesis. That is, on the one hand, the tension brought about by opposition between the FGC reform agenda and the Bondo society members’ attempts to resist change in the ritual practice. On the other hand, I am concerned with the tension in the patronage they enjoy from politicians who are caught up in a double bind situation: they simultaneously need support from Bondo members but are, at the same time, reliant on international development aid. In exploring power from below, I examine Bondo society’s community stock of knowledge and how this symbolic power is employed in Sierra Leonean politics. This does not lead to a vindication of FGC but underscores the complex social, economic and political meanings embedded in the Bondo and in discourses of power in Sierra Leone. The thesis points out that eradication advocates need to take account of the various dimensions of the Bondo society’s embeddedness in relation to both state and society.",1415373857,,Dissertations & Theses," Bosire, Obara TomBosireTomObaraBosire, Obara Tom", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031755661 , 80750882 , 101309 , U590435 , U590435 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3506/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415373857?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3506/ , (UMI)AAIU590435 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+bondo+secret+society%3A+female+circumcision+and+the+sierra+leonean+state&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bosire%2C+Obara+Tom&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Apprentices to power: The cultivation of American youth nationalism, 1935–1970","This dissertation investigates how privately-operated youth leadership programs promoted citizenship among millions of adolescents and furnished political apprenticeships for many past and current American leaders. It considers four major programs: the American Legion’s Boys’ State and Boys’ Nation; American Legion Auxiliary’s Girls State/Nation; YMCA Youth and Government; the Junior Statesmen of America; and the Society for Ethical Culture’s Encampment for Citizenship (EFC), as well as smaller, likeminded initiatives. From small pilot projects, the programs grew into quasi-official youth movements for the United States responsible for training millions of adolescents and young people in the arts of government. Welding youth politics to the State through a diffuse network of democracy camps, these programs aimed to resolve fears that the next generation of American citizens would be too disaffected or too ignorant to assume leadership of the country and tend the wheels of government. In their hands-on, youth-centered approach to instruction, the programs incorporated tenets of Progressive education and borrowed from models of international youth work. Although the curricula promoted varieties of “civic” nationalism, the general thrust was conservative, especially since programmers generally sought to cultivate a leadership class limited in many ways by gender, race, and physical condition. Over a thirty-five year period, organizers sought to promote various ideological and political agendas, from the maintenance of youth allegiance during the Great Depression and World War II, to the construction of a post-war domestic “consensus” and American hegemony abroad. Students avidly competed to obtain valuable “social capital” to invest in their budding careers. By 1970, the programs had lost favor with many young people and the public because of their inherent conservatism and the curriculum’s perceived lack of relevance to contemporary problems of war and inequality.",1420355214,,Dissertations & Theses," Nicholson, Bryan WilliamNicholsonWilliamBryanNicholson, Bryan William", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3044953191 , 80780612 , 66569 , 9781303162732 , 3570675 , 3570675", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781303162732, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1420355214?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0520 Education history"," 0337 American history , 0520 Education history"," 0337 American history , 0520 Education history",," 0337 American history , 0520 Education history"," American history , Education history"," Social sciences , Education , Citizenship , History , Nationalism , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Apprentices+to+power%3A++The+cultivation+of+American+youth+nationalism%2C+1935%E2%80%931970&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nicholson%2C+Bryan+William&amp;isbn=9781303162732&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Feral goats (&lt;i&gt;Capra hircus &lt;/i&gt;L.) in the landscape: behaviour, home range and habitat use.","This thesis examines aspects of the behavioural ecology of feral goats in Ireland, focusing on grouping dynamics, activity budgets, in two distinct study areas in southwest Ireland; the Burren region and the Beara peninsula, as well as home range, habitat use and the effect of long-term grazing exclusion in the Burren.  There has been conflict between the presence and habitat use of feral goats and local landowners in the Burren and there is also the possibility of a remnant population of feral goats with Neolithic origins.  The limestone pavements of the Burren are a much more open habitat than the mountainous Beara.  Group size in the Beara ranged from 1-42 goats whereas in the Burren it ranged from 1-158 goats. Sex ratios were significantly skewed towards adult females in the Beara, where trophy shooting of large adult males occurs.  Feeding was the dominant activity recorded, followed by standing and lying.  Other behaviours, including movement, grooming, social behaviours and rumination, accounted for a smaller proportion of the time budget.  Time spent feeding did not vary between herds or seasonally but was found to increase during the last three months of the calendar year.  Home range and habitat use was investigated using GPS telemetry technology, the first time GPS tracking has been used to assess the home ranges of Irish feral goats. Inter-individual variation was found in home range size, with Minimum convex polygon estimates of 1,075-1,428ha. Habitat selection was found to vary between tracked individuals, but each goat showed a strong avoidance of improved agricultural grassland, except during January-March when use of this habitat switched from avoidance to usage relative to the proportion available.  This corresponds to times of increased energy requirements for goats during the post-winter and kidding period and when, as reported elsewhere, forage quality in the other available habitats is lower.  The Burren region has been shaped by centuries of grazing and farming practices, which maintain the rare Mediterranean and Arctic-alpine floral assemblages of international conservation importance.  Two grazing enclosures were established in 1980 near the summit of Mullagh More in the Burren National Park, in order to determine the long term impacts of grazing by cattle Bos taurus and feral goats.  After 31 years of grazing exclusion there was marked expansion of trees/shrubs, particularly of hazel Corylus avellana L., and a reduction in the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) Annex I positive indicator species and in species associated with limestone pavements and orchid-rich grasslands.",1442483919,,Dissertations & Theses," Enright, R.A.EnrightR.A.Enright, R.A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101110501 , 80750972 , 101309 , U594815 , U594815", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442483919?accountid=14496, 0329 Ecology, 0329 Ecology, 0329 Ecology,, 0329 Ecology, Ecology," (UMI)AAIU594815 , Biological sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Feral+goats+%28Capra+hircus+L.%29+in+the+landscape%3A+behaviour%2C+home+range+and+habitat+use.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Enright%2C+R.A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The politics of care and transnational mobility,"This thesis explores the politics of care and transnational mobility – through a multi-sited ethnography of the everyday lives of a variety of migrant populations. Utilising a mixed-methodology it investigates the interconnections between care, mobility, labour and control. The care labour process is examined, particularly that of care homes for older people. It is seen that mobility controls shape the working and living conditions, employment relations and forms of exploitability experienced by differentially included migrants. As well as such dynamics the thesis also explores the strategies that emerge from within the workplace itself that migrants utilise in order to negotiate such conditions. Care is also examined from the vantage point of the lives of asylum applicants and their experiences of the asylum support regime that has emerged in recent years. Welfare and support services are argued to have increasingly come to be utilised as regulatory mechanisms. The numerous ways this occurs and the effects this has on such migrants are examined as is the dual function that NGOs have come to play within such processes as both providers of support and sustainability and agents of control. A further aspect of care concerns the self-organised networks of care that migrants create amongst themselves. The concept of the ‘mobile commons’ is developed to argue that both the transnational and local networks of care that migrants craft, as well as the caring relations afforded through institutions such as churches are key in enabling migrants to become mobile, negotiate their caring commitments and sustain themselves while in transit or in a given location. By thinking the relationship between care and migration from these interrelated perspectives the thesis aims to contribute to a reappraisal of existing forms of social movement organising and political mobilisation around the issue of mobility.",1442496025,,Dissertations & Theses," Bishop, HywelBishopHywelBishop, Hywel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101218151 , 82331872 , 101309 , U597664 , U597664 , http://orca.cf.ac.uk/27821/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442496025?accountid=14496, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0344 Social research, Social research," http://orca.cf.ac.uk/27821/ , (UMI)AAIU597664 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+care+and+transnational+mobility&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bishop%2C+Hywel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Walking through the intercultural field: an ethnographic study on intercultural language learning as a spatial-embodied practice,"Within concepts on intercultural language learning it is generally acknowledged that the ‘context’ of the individual learning experience plays an important role for the acquisition of a foreign language and intercultural learning processes. A detailed understanding of what it is we call ‘context’ is still missing – as are studies that focus particularly on the language learning environment outside the classroom and the role of everyday space and place for intercultural encounter. This thesis draws largely on spatial theory in addressing space and place as a site of geo-political and social-cultural change, and as a crucial element of intercultural language learning processes. Narratives, de Certeau (1984: 116) says, are “written by footsteps.” The methodological orientation of this thesis follows both the narratives and footsteps of language learners, and as such is anchored in and around the element of movement. In creating a spatial ‘method assemblage’ (Law 2004) that engages both mobile and visual elements, I am arguing for a methodological change in perspective while giving credit to the perspective of language learners and their everyday routes and learning environments. This argument correlates with the particular methodological tool of ‘guided walks’, in which researcher and language learner walk together on daily routes within places of significance. Giving walking a central methodological and analytic role within this thesis underlines those moments of intercultural experience, which are based on movement, transformation and the search for the ephemeral. The particular understanding of intercultural language learning as a ‘spatial-embodied practice’ emerges from an ethnographic study as well as from a detailed examination of the ‘intercultural field’. The various imbalances of the ‘intercultural field’ effect intercultural language learning through the body, as well as the senses and practices of diversity, and re-shape an awareness of space. Not only increased physical mobility, but the complex networks of flows and transnational interrelations, increasingly transform intercultural experience. From this perspective, this thesis argues that language learners weave their intercultural experience through practices of ‘place making’ (Ingold 2011), and by moving in between myriad borders and boundaries.",1442496096,,Dissertations & Theses," Woitsch, UlrikeWoitschUlrikeWoitsch, Ulrike", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101219251 , 80734722 , 101309 , U598819 , U598819 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3325/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442496096?accountid=14496, 0727 Curriculum development, 0727 Curriculum development, 0727 Curriculum development, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0727 Curriculum development, Curriculum development," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3325/ , (UMI)AAIU598819 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Walking+through+the+intercultural+field%3A+an+ethnographic+study+on+intercultural+language+learning+as+a+spatial-embodied+practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Woitsch%2C+Ulrike&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Moving in a narrative space: dental practitioners developing professionally in and out of ict,"This narrative inquiry grew from my concerns that the voices of dental practitioners were going unheard in movements to reform professional development, in particular through information and communication technology (ICT). Recently, professional development policy has been driven by calls for a greater use of ICT for education, healthcare and professional development. However, from casual conversations in my own practice and with colleagues, I noted tensions that raised questions on the rationale underpinning many of the changes taking place. I began to ask what we might understand by professional development, and how we might seek it through ICT. In turning to literature on professional development, dentistry was a relatively unexplored area. In addition, little was known about the actual experiences of those seeking professional development. My concerns and questions, combined with this lack of research in the field of dental professional development and the use of ICT, suggested the need to explore the experiences of dental practitioners undertaking professional development and to consider their views on ICT. My assumption is that experiences are embedded in everyday conversations and exchanges as the stories we tell each other. To be able to understand those experiences, I felt a need to access those conversations and exchanges. This meant going further than collecting data from tick boxes at the end of course evaluation sheets. Taking a narrative approach and using qualitative interviews, I collected the stories of nine dental professionals. In the conversations that took place, the participants and I explored and reflected on our own practice, professional development and ICT. Using a performative analysis (Riessman 2008), I reconstructed the stories through Davies and Harré’s (1999) metaphor of an ‘unfolding narrative’ (p.42), taking stories as an emergent process through interaction with different social and cultural representations. While the focus at the start of this study was on ICT, it rapidly became clear that the participants did not regard ICT as a central part of being a practitioner and indeed a professional. Accordingly, the study became one of exploring being a practitioner and a professional, and the influences of recent organisational and institutional changes and ICT moved from a central to a peripheral focus. From the resultant stories, I found three performances dominated in which practitioners developed ways of “being”, “instincts”, as I named them which emerged in response to a negotiation with policy, practice and paths of development. I identified those instincts emerging from a “professional self” constructed from policy through fixed predetermined paths. This contrasted with a “practitioner self” which drew from intuition, craft-like practices, and paths of development which were largely undetermined. I identified shifting positions and subjectivities as practitioners reflected on their values for practice and professional development. From those reflections, there was a questioning of the professional role, the way the dental professional might be represented, the way the practitioner self might develop and the way they might position themselves, in particular in expanded spaces for professional development through ICT. In order to interpret the resultant performances within both global and micro-contexts, I viewed them through a critical lens, interrogating the sociocultural and political environment. I found that representations of the professional role suggested a challenge for education, self-determination and development. As a result, I saw those participants sitting in a “liminal space”; a junction of sociocultural influences framed by policy, professional life, practice and ICT. This liminal space yielded a multitude of challenges, negotiations and possibilities as the ‘inevitable consequences of certain economic, social and political processes’ (Brookfield 1995, p.36). In conclusion, in the face of those framings and education, I propose a need for a “professional literacy” and a new professional narrative that considers the capabilities and possibilities for dialogue and, in the light of our practice and advancing technology, would take account of expanded and undetermined paths of professional development.",1442496122,,Dissertations & Theses," McDonald, Julie AnnMcDonaldAnnJulieMcDonald, Julie Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101218881 , 82349832 , 101309 , U596719 , U596719 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3632/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442496122?accountid=14496, 0519 School counseling, 0519 School counseling, 0519 School counseling, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0519 School counseling, School counseling," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3632/ , (UMI)AAIU596719 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Moving+in+a+narrative+space%3A+dental+practitioners+developing+professionally+in+and+out+of+ict&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McDonald%2C+Julie+Ann&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The effects of the music-with-movement intervention of the cognitive functions of people with moderate dementia,"Background: Music-with-Movement (MM) is an active approach in music intervention. It has been advocated suitable for people with moderate-stage dementia. However, no culturally relevant and evidence-based MM intervention protocol for enhancing cognitive functions had thus far been available. It is essential to systematically develop such a protocol and test its effectiveness in enhancing cognitive functions. Aims: The primary objective was to examine the effects of the MM intervention on the cognitive functions of people with moderate-stage dementia over time, as compared with two comparison groups, namely the Music Listening (ML) and Social Activity (SA) groups. The secondary objective was to examine the direct and mediated effects of the activities (MM, ML, and SA) as a whole on the cognitive functions of people with moderate dementia. Design: This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. One hundred and sixty five participants were recruited and were randomly allocated into three groups: the MM, ML, and SA groups. The outcome variables included global cognition, memory, attention, verbal fluency, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and agitated behavior, which were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention (T1), and at six weeks post-intervention (T2). Anxiety, depressive symptoms, and agitated behaviour were regarded as mediators of the effects of the intervention on cognitive functions. Results: The mixed multivariate analysis showed that there were no significant interaction group by time effect, group effect, and time effect. The univariate analysis revealed that the MM group differed significantly from the comparison groups over time in memory function (both memory storage and delayed recall) and depressive symptoms. The pairwise comparison between the three time points showed that the MM could lead to improvements in global cognition, verbal fluency, anxiety, and agitated behaviour. The effects on anxiety and agitated behaviour also lasted for at least six weeks post-intervention. The SEM analysis result showed that the activities (MM, ML and SA) had no direct or indirect effects on any of the cognitive outcomes. However, anxiety had a positive effect on agitation and memory, and agitation had a negative effect on memory but a positive effect on attention. Conclusion: This was a pioneer study investigating the effects of the evidence-based MM intervention on the cognitive functions of people with moderate-stage dementia, guided by a conceptual model with theoretical underpinnings. The univariate and pairwise comparisons are favourable to the MM intervention. The findings of this study provide insights for further research, and implications for both theory and practice on caring for people with moderate dementia.",1448306970,,Dissertations & Theses," Cheung, Sze KiCheungKiSzeCheung, Sze Ki", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3116935211 , 79128882 , 66569 , 9781303477058 , 3574109 , 3574109", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781303477058, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448306970?accountid=14496," 0569 Nursing , 0633 Cognitive psychology"," 0569 Nursing , 0633 Cognitive psychology"," 0569 Nursing , 0633 Cognitive psychology",," 0569 Nursing , 0633 Cognitive psychology"," Nursing , Cognitive psychology , Dementia , Music"," Psychology , Health and environmental sciences , Cognition , Dementia , Music-with-movement , Non-pharmacological intervention",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+effects+of+the+music-with-movement+intervention+of+the+cognitive+functions+of+people+with+moderate+dementia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cheung%2C+Sze+Ki&amp;isbn=9781303477058&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"State-society relations and regional role: comparing egypt and south africa,"The study explains the regional roles of Egypt and South Africa in the last two decades by reference to the state’s relationship with society, a variable that has long been underplayed in international relations and foreign policy literature. It suggests that the different character of this relationship in each country has shaped the opportunities and constraints affecting the foreign policy choices of both the state and societal institutions in the two countries. The study adopts a cross-disciplinary approach using debates on state capacity and its relationship with regime type in comparative politics and political economy to understand and evaluate the two countries' foreign policies in their respective regions. After analysing the impact of state-society relationships on the regional role conceptions of the state and societal actors, the study compares the performance of these actors in two case studies; the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the case of Egypt and the Zimbabwean crisis in the case of South Africa. It concludes that although the role of each state in resolving its respective regional conflict has been less than effective, the post-apartheid democratic dispensation has provided opportunities for South African social forces to play roles that complemented, checked and balanced the role of the state, compared to their Egyptian counterparts. On the other hand, the soft authoritarian Egyptian state used its role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to maintain the international alliances that helped to sustain its domestic control. This constrained the state's foreign policy options. It made marketing peace as 'a strategic choice' and containing resistance movements the priorities of Egypt's intervention in the Palestinian issue. The co-optation of the Egyptian business community and the exclusion of Islamist forces by the state weakened their roles in conflict resolution, depriving the state of tools of effectiveness. In the case of South Africa, racial politics, the ANC's liberation movement psyche, and the domination of the presidency over foreign policy making have hindered the promotion of NEPAD's principles of democracy and respect for human rights in the case of Zimbabwe. However, South African civil society played a crucial role in supporting its Zimbabwean counterpart, holding the South African state accountable to its foreign policy principles and its democratic institutions, and intervening where the state's role was missing or insufficient.",1508815957,,Dissertations & Theses," Amer, Rawya M.

It examines how her poetic landscape responds to the conditions of modernity in an age of modernization, expansionism, colonialism and science. In particular, I look at how the social and cultural representations of nature and heaven are revised and appropriated in her poems to challenge the hierarchical structure of visual dominance embedded in the public discourses of her time. Although she seldom travelled, her writing oscillates between experiential empiricism, sensationalistic reportage, and ecological imagination to account for the social and geographical transition of a rapidly industrialized and commercialized society. The notion of transcendence, progress and ascension in Enlightenment and Transcendentalist writings, based upon technological advancement and geographical expansion, characterized the social and cultural imagination of her time. Alternatively, an increasingly cosmopolitan New England registers a poetic contact zones as well as a Bakhtinian carnivalesque space, in which colonial relations can be subverted, western constructions of orientalism challenged, and capitalist modernity inflected. Dickinson voiced in her poems her critical reception of such a phantasmagoric site of a modern world. I explore how her cartographic projection registers the conflicting nature of modernity, while resists the process of empowerment pursued by her contemporary writers, presenting a more dynamic poetic vision of the world. In the first chapter, I explore her use of empirical mapping as a poetic approach to challenge the Enlightenment notion of progress and modernity. I look at her poems of social transitions, especially her poems of the Bible, the train, the pastoral, and the graveyard, to show how she addresses the issue of modernization. Her visit to Mount Auburn and the rural landscape movement are explored to show her complex poetic response toward modernity. In the second chapter, I focus on her poems of emigration and exploration to see how she appropriates frontier metaphors and exploratory narratives that dominated the discourses of national and cultural projects of her time. The colonial expeditions and national expansionism of her time are examined to show her revision and deconstruction of quest narratives. In the third chapter, I examine her commercial metaphors in relation to cosmopolitanism. I discuss her metaphors of tourism to see how her poems are based upon the notion of consumption as a poetic mode that is closely related to the violence of global displacement and imperial contestation. Her tourist experiences and reading of travel writings will be examined to show her critical response towards the dominant visual representations of her time. In the last chapter, I explore her poems of visitation and reception to show her elastic spatial imagination through her notion of neighbouring and compound vision. In particular, I discuss her poetic reception and appropriation of the theories of Edward Hitchcock and Thomas De Quincey. I conclude suggesting that her spatial imagination reveals her poetic attempt to account for the conditions of modernity.",1512391900,,Dissertations & Theses," Hsu, Li-HsinHsuLi-HsinHsu, Li-Hsin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264647841 , 80753092 , 101309 , U605687 , U605687 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/7573", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512391900?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0591 American literature, American literature," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/7573 , (UMI)AAIU605687 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emily+dickinson%27s+poetic+mapping+of+the+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hsu%2C+Li-Hsin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Tale of two townships: race, class and the changing contours of collective action in the Cape Town townships of Guguletu and Bonteheuwel, 1976 - 2006","This thesis examines the emergence and evolution of ‘progressive activism and organisation’ between 1976 and 2006 in the African township of Guguletu and the coloured township of Bonteheuwel within the City of Cape Town. In doing so it compares both how activism has changed over time (including as a result of democratisation) and how it differed between and within these two communities. Whilst at heart an empirical study of activism it seeks to move beyond the specificities of the cases studied to also draw broader conclusions about the nature and causes of collective action and organisation.Drawing on both social movement and class theory it aims to shed some light on the fundamental question of the relationship between structure and agency - why do people act and what defines the form of action they take? It combines a quantitative study of the changing relationship between race, class and state policy with qualitative studies of activism in Guguletu and Bonteheuwel. These two studies cover in detail: the development and unfolding of the riots of 1976; the great boycott season of 1979/80 which saw large numbers of Africans and coloureds across Cape Town drawn into school, bus and consumer boycotts; the development of activism between 1980 and 1985, including the impact of the United Democratic Front; the township unrest of 1985-7; the transition period between 1988 and 1994; and post-apartheid activism in the two communities. It draws on theories of class which recognise the importance of peoples’ positions within the state’s distributional networks (citizenship), experiences and expectations of social mobility and the impact of historical experience of class formation on expectation (moral economy). In doing this it shows how differences in race, education, age and labour market position all interacted to pattern activism in the case studies. Struggles in Cape Town throughout the period 1976-2006 were not dualistic conflict between classes, races or between the oppressed and forces of global capital, nor were they mechanistic responses to the opening and closing of political space. They were complex coalitions of competing and collaborating class forces which were defined by the underlying nature of the city’s political economy and which emerged in interaction with changing opportunities for action.",1512393882,,Dissertations & Theses," Staniland, John Luke SeneviratneStanilandLuke SeneviratneJohnStaniland, John Luke Seneviratne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264654531 , 80733552 , 101309 , U604071 , U604071 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/6420", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512393882?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/6420 , (UMI)AAIU604071 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tale+of+two+townships%3A+race%2C+class+and+the+changing+contours+of+collective+action+in+the+Cape+Town+townships+of+Guguletu+and+Bonteheuwel%2C+1976+-+2006&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Staniland%2C+John+Luke+Seneviratne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Human trafficking: women's stories of agency,"This thesis is about women’s stories of agency in a trafficking experience. The idea of agency is a difficult concept to fathom, given the unscrupulous acts and exploitative practices which demarcate and define trafficking. In response to the three Ps of trafficking policy (prevention and protection of victims and the simultaneous prosecution of traffickers) official discourse constructs trafficking agency in singular opposition to trafficking victimhood. The ‘true’ victim of trafficking is reified in attributes of passivity and worthiness, whereas signs of women’s agency are read as consent in their own predicament or as culpability in criminal justice and immigration rule breaking. Moving beyond the official lack or criminal fact of agency, this research adds knowledge on agency constructed with, on, and by women possessing a trafficking experience. This fills an internationally recognised gap in the trafficking discourse. Within the thesis, female agency is explored in feminist terms of women’s immediate well-being agency (their physical safety and economic needs) and their longer term requirements for agency freedom (their capacity to construct choices and the conditions affecting choice). This feminist exploration of the terrain on trafficking found ways in which female agency takes shape in relationship and in degrees to women’s subjective and structural victimisation. Based upon the stories of twenty six women gathered through an in-depth qualitative study, agency is visible in identity, decision making and actions. Women fashioned individual trafficking identities from their subjective engagement with the official trafficking descriptors. Additionally, their identification with ties to home (expressed via family relationships, occupational roles, national dress and ethnic food) helped to sustain their pre-trafficking personas. Women exhibited agency in risk taking and choices (initial, shared, constrained and precarious), which characterised their journeys and explained their grading of trafficking ‘pains’. Significantly, the fieldwork raised women’s engagement with ‘the rules’ and practices of the host society, as a way of realising new social, recreational, educational, employment, sexual and consumer related freedoms. Acknowledging the international and UK serious organised crime frame on trafficking, the fieldwork also included fifteen interviews with anti-trafficking professionals involved in delivering the three Ps of trafficking policy. This complementary standpoint to women’s stories presents ways in which official actors helped and hindered women’s achievement of well-being and agency freedoms. Crucially, in addressing trafficking as an evolving and integral aspect in contemporary global movement - displaying similarity and cross over with migration, smuggling, asylum and refugee accounts - this research unearthed trafficking exploitations and experiences around transnational marriage, which have been traditionally isolated and overlooked by UK trafficking discourse and policy platforms.",1512397143,,Dissertations & Theses," De Angelis, Maria IvannaDe AngelisIvannaMariaDe Angelis, Maria Ivanna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264695801 , 86599932 , 101309 , U604074 , U604074 , http://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:5823", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512397143?accountid=14496, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, 0344 Social research, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0344 Social research, Social research," http://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:5823 , (UMI)AAIU604074 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Human+trafficking%3A+women%27s+stories+of+agency&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=De+Angelis%2C+Maria+Ivanna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Graphic revolt!: scandinavian artists' workshops, 1968-1975: røde mor, folkets ateljé and gras","This thesis examines the relationship between the three artists' workshops Røde Mor (Red Mother), Folkets Ateljé (The People's Studio) and GRAS, who worked between 1968 and 1975 in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Røde Mor was from the outset an articulated Communist graphic workshop loosely organised around collective exhibitions. It developed into a highly productive and professionalised group of artists that made posters by commission for political and social movements. Its artists developed a familiar and popular artistic language characterised by imaginative realism and socialist imagery. Folkets Ateljé, which has never been studied before, was a close knit underground group which created quick and immediate responses to concurrent political issues. This group was founded on the example of Atelier Populaire in France and is strongly related to its practices. Within this comparative study it is the group that comes closest to collective practises around 1968 outside Scandinavia, namely the democratic assembly. The silkscreen workshop GRAS stemmed from the idea of economic and artistic freedom, although socially motivated and politically involved, the group never implemented any doctrine for participation. The aim of this transnational study is to reveal common denominators to the three groups' poster art as it was produced in connection with a Scandinavian experience of 1968. By ‘1968' it is meant the period from the late 1960s till the end of the 1970s. It examines the socio-political conditions under which the groups flourished and shows how these groups operated in conjunction with the political environment of 1968. The thesis explores the relationship between political movements and the collective art making process as it appeared in Scandinavia. To present a comprehensible picture of the impact of 1968 on these groups, their artworks, manifestos, and activities outside of the collective space have been discussed. The argument has presented itself that even though these groups had very similar ideological stances, their posters and techniques differ. This has impacted the artists involved to different degrees, yet made it possible to express the same political goals. It is suggested to be linked with the Scandinavian social democracies and common experience of the radicalisation that took place mostly in the aftermath of 1968 proper. By comparing these three groups' it has been uncovered that even with the same socio-political circumstances and ideological stance divergent styles did develop to embrace these issue.",1512398335,,Dissertations & Theses," Glomm, Anna SandakerGlommSandakerAnnaGlomm, Anna Sandaker", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264696761 , 86593372 , 101309 , U605610 , U605610 , http://hdl.handle.net/10023/3171", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512398335?accountid=14496, 0357 Fine arts, 0357 Fine arts, 0357 Fine arts, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0357 Fine arts, Fine arts," http://hdl.handle.net/10023/3171 , (UMI)AAIU605610 , Communication and the arts , Denmark , Norway , Sweden",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Graphic+revolt%21%3A+scandinavian+artists%27+workshops%2C+1968-1975%3A+r%C3%B8de+mor%2C+folkets+atelj%C3%A9+and+gras&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Glomm%2C+Anna+Sandaker&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Fundamental rights versus fundamental freedoms: A change in the reasoning of the Court of Justice of the European Union?,"It has been well documented that the European Union (EU) began as an economic organization which now concerns itself with a variety of social issues, such as fundamental rights. This dissertation seeks to address a change in the Court of Justice of the European Union’s (CJEU) reasoning from that of the fundamental freedoms and free movement so closely linked to the economic community to fundamental rights, which has growing importance within all international organisations, particularly in the area of Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters (PJCC). The dissertation looks specifically to the rights of victims; the European Arrest Warrant; and, the rights of suspects. It is argued that there has been an increase in rulings in favour of fundamental rights from the Court, although not always dealt with adequately. It is also contended that fundamental freedoms are taking a lesser role, as illustrated by these PJCC rulings on wholly internal situations. However it is also argued that at times fundamental rights and freedoms are not always competing but in fact fundamental rights and freedoms are competing against the cornerstone of judicial cooperation; mutual trust.",1512400506,,Dissertations & Theses," Lafferty, Siobhan MairiLaffertyMairiSiobhanLafferty, Siobhan Mairi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264726201 , 80730242 , 101309 , U607159 , U607159 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3701/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512400506?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0616 International law"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law",," 0398 Law , 0616 International law"," Law , International law"," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3701/ , (UMI)AAIU607159 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fundamental+rights+versus+fundamental+freedoms%3A+A+change+in+the+reasoning+of+the+Court+of+Justice+of+the+European+Union%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lafferty%2C+Siobhan+Mairi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Of the earthquake and other stories: the continuity of change in pakistan-administered kashmir,"On October 8th 2005 the villages surrounding Chinati bazaar in Bagh district of Pakistani-administered Kashmir (PaK) were hit by an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale that affected the lives of more than 3.5 million people in PaK and Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. In this thesis I attempt to understand, through the stories and narratives of the people of Chinati bazaar, how they lived through, made sense of, and dealt with the earthquake and its aftermath. I use participant observation and conversations to tell the stories of those affected by the earthquake in their own voices as much as possible. The storytellers of the bazaar lived through two types of events: the earthquake itself and the post-earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction process. The latter brought with it both positive and negative impacts: if, on the one hand, it brought progress and a new hope that life could be ‘Built Back Better', on the other hand, it brought a different type of suffering – one that led to a loss of honour and dignity, resulted in social upheavals, and led to the exclusion and marginalization of certain groups. In this thesis I focus on both these ‘events'. Through these stories I build an argument about post-disaster discourses of change. I argue that while the narratives of the storytellers of Chinati bazaar posit the earthquake as a point of rupture in their confabulated stories, from which the collective memory of the bazaar dates its movement towards becoming modern and global, these changes have their origins instead in ‘bigger' stories of modernisation and globalisation that predate the earthquake and that highlight and emphasise more continuous processes of change that have been occurring over a longer period of time. In this thesis I analyse how these two competing discourses of rupture and dramatic change on the one hand, and slow, continuous change on the other, play out in the lives of the storytellers of Chinati Bazaar.",1535010522,,Dissertations & Theses," Loureiro, MiguelLoureiroMiguelLoureiro, Miguel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331776861 , 71869562 , 101309 , U608781 , U608781 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/43284/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535010522?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0366 Geography , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Geography , South Asian Studies"," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/43284/ , (UMI)AAIU608781 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Of+the+earthquake+and+other+stories%3A+the+continuity+of+change+in+pakistan-administered+kashmir&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Loureiro%2C+Miguel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Stratified reproduction and migrant women in Ireland: Service providers' representations of culture and rights in migrant women's crisis pregnancy experiences,"To date, no research has focused on migrant women’s crisis pregnancy experiences in the Irish context. This thesis aims to explore the ways in which culture and socialisation and stratified rights and entitlements accorded to migrant women living in Ireland impact on their crisis pregnancy experiences, decision-making processes, outcomes and needs. The thesis focuses on three groups from distinct cultural backgrounds with stratified rights to: remain, family reunification, health, travel, work and social welfare. These are Chinese international students, Filipino labour migrants and Nigerian asylum seekers. In order to research and analyse the thesis topic the researcher developed three new analytical models. The theoretical model incorporated elements of rational choice theory, theories of rights and needs and theory related to culture and socialisation. The decision making model encompassed seven crisis pregnancy outcome alternatives including illegal forms of abortion. Due to the exploratory nature of the study qualitative methods were selected for data collection. Twenty-five in-depth, semi structured interviews were conducted with crisis pregnancy counsellors and service providers who worked closely with the migrant groups. The findings reveal a system of stratified reproduction and indicate that although women’s crisis pregnancy decisions are strongly influenced by cultural norms and expectations emanating from their countries of origin, it is their limited rights and entitlements in the Irish context that exclude women from certain outcomes and channel them towards pregnancy outcomes which are inconsistent with their preferences. The findings show that exclusion from rights-based privileges gives rise to a host of unmet needs which impact on the crisis pregnancy experience. Unmet needs were found to a) lead to crisis pregnancies b) dissuade women from becoming parents when in Ireland and c) stand in the way of women receiving timely, affordable, safe and legal abortions. The thesis discusses these needs in relation to a framework which emerged inductively from the data. The model incorporates needs relating to: security and stability, economic security, social supports, freedom of movement, health, information, language and communication.

Costas,"This thesis examines the missiological writings of Orlando E. Costas (1943-1987), particularly The Church and Its Mission: A Shattering Critique from the Third World (1974); Theology of the Crossroads in Contemporary Latin America (1976); Christ Outside the Gate (1982); and Liberating News: A Theology of Contextual Evangelization (1989). From the early 1970s until his death in 1987 he wrote over 130 articles and 12 books in both Spanish and English that addressed key missiological concerns. A careful reading of a selection of Costas’s texts oriented around a hymn, a gospel song, a psalm, and a poem provides the shape of this thesis. This thesis argues that Costas formulated a Third World evangelical missiology. Chapter one investigates what Costas’s autobiographical material expressed about his positions on conversion, Protestant evangelicalism, missiology, and those living on the ‘periphery’ of life. Chapter two recognises his commitment to the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean in particular and the Third World in general. Chapter three explores Costas’s analysis of the Latin American Protestant Church in a revolutionary situation in the continent and chapter four examines his survey and critical appraisal of Latin American liberation theology. Chapter five recognizes the pastoral shape of Costas's missiology. Chapter six explores his critical interaction with two more conservative evangelical missiological positions, the Church Growth Movement and Peter Beyerhaus and the Frankfurt Declaration, and chapter seven surveys the discussion within the international evangelical community regarding the relationship between evangelism and social responsibility. Chapter eight examines Costas’s Liberating News as an expression of Third World evangelical missiology. Chapter nine considers the theological issue of penal substitutionary atonement and his missiology. The thesis concludes with an appraisal of the issues and contributions of Costas’s Third World evangelical missiology to current missiological discussion.",1548710589,,Dissertations & Theses," Tippner, Jeffrey E.TippnerE.JeffreyTippner, Jeffrey E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3385941341 , 74054082 , 101309 , U611727 , U611727 , http://hdl.handle.net/10023/3278", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1548710589?accountid=14496, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology, 0469 Theology,, 0469 Theology, Theology," http://hdl.handle.net/10023/3278 , (UMI)AAIU611727 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Third+World+evangelical+missiology+of+Orlando+E.+Costas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tippner%2C+Jeffrey+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""In the Public's Interest: Evictions, Citizenship and Inequality in Contemporary Delhi","To understand how the evictions of the poor in Delhi can be read as acts in the ""public interest,"" this dissertation argues that we must first locate the basti in the particularity of the production of space in Delhi. The term basti is used most often by the poor to describe their homes that are often marked by some measure of physical, economic, and infrastructural vulnerability. The basti is often reduced to the slum, a marker of illegal occupation of land and, more broadly, the dysfunctional landscape of the megacities of the global South. Yet this dissertation argues that more than just a 'slum,' built environment, material housing stock, or planning category, a basti is, in fact, a territorialisation of a political engagement within which the poor negotiate their presence in as well as right to the city. It is a spatial manifestation of the negotiations of citizenship. Its eviction then represents not just the demolition of a built environment but the transformation of precisely this political engagement—an erasure of the poor's presence within and right to the city. Read this way, evictions allow us to access the politics of the production and reproduction of poverty and inequality in the contemporary Indian city and the negotiations of citizenship that underlie it. Broadly, this dissertation argues that evictions make visible make visible a juridicalisation of politics in the Indian city. This juridicalisation is marked by the emergence of new frameworks, discourses and practices in urban politics that instantiate themselves in the city through the judiciary rather within the more familiar institutional compacts between institutions of representative government and urban residents. The juridicalisation of politics marks the expansion of the jurisdiction not just of the courts but also of the realm of the law within urban politics. Following its concern with the politics of poverty, inequality and citizenship, the dissertation traces juridicalisation along one particular vector: it shows how evictions were made to make ""legal sense"" within public interest litigations. Four key frameworks thus emerge: (a) planned illegalities; (b) planned development and/as crisis; (b) the impoverishment of poverty; and (c) the juridicalisation of resistance. The dissertation first constructs a spatial history of inhabitation in the city to challenge the assumed relationships between ""illegality,"" planning and the settlements of the poor, arguing that the ""illegal"" production of urban space in Delhi comprises not just the 'slum' but the production of illegal housing by the middle and upper middle classes as well. It does so by problematizing the familiar and commonsensical narrative of the ""failure of planning"" in the Indian city and showing that the traces of planning ensure that the city may not be as it was planned but it is an outcome of planning. It argues that illegality is the dominant mode of the production of housing in Delhi and that it is within illegalities that the production of urban space in the city must be understood. Having established the relationship between illegality, planning and planned development in the city empirically, the dissertation then analyses a body of case law in the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court of India to show that the Courts misrecognise illegality in their twin understandings of ""encroachment"" and ""encroacher"" when they portray the former as the visible manifestation of what they see as the crisis of the city and the latter as one of the actors primarily responsible for this crisis. Showing how the courts use narratives of the failure of ""planned development"" and what they call ""Government"" to justify their interventions into the city, the dissertation describes their attempt to make the city into a governable space using the ""Plan in its legal position"" to represent an idealized spatial order. Further, the dissertation argues that the case-law on evictions makes visible the impoverishment of poverty, drawing upon Upendra Baxi's concept of impoverishment as a dynamic process of public decision-making in which it is considered just, right and fair that some people may become or stay impoverished. The Courts enable impoverishment by through the creation of the category of the ""encroacher"" that binds the identity of the poor to a spatial illegality and becomes the basis of a disavowal of their rights. Additionally, through the discursive erasure of the vulnerability of the poor and the emergence of a new ""urban majority"" as the subject of urban politics, they transform the poor into improper citizens thereby legitimizing a regime of differentiated citizenship. Using interviews with activists in urban social movements in Delhi, the dissertation further shows how the emergence of the judiciary as the site and object of resistance has resulted in the juridicalisation of resistance.

It investigates how the organisation of in-between space affects social interaction in different urban patterns. As many researchers caution, terms such as semi-private and semi-public can be deceptive in attempting to define the relationship between the building and the street, because of the overlapping territory of this space. Therefore in this study the in-between space concept is used to portray this space and the interrelations that take place. Modernist urban space has changed the spatial relations between the building and the street. Previous research (Gehl, 1996) has revealed that the organisation of space between buildings has an important impact in terms of social interaction. Through organising these thresholds and giving the possibility of forming social activities, people have the chance to encounter more frequently and develop friendships. Thus this study also examines whether modern environments can develop a sense of community and neighbouring compared to traditional neighbourhoods by their spatial configuration and broken relation between the building and the street. This research adopts a mixed method approach to understand the complex relations and socio-spatial structure of the city. It utilises various methods through focusing on three dissimilar urban patterns in Izmir, Turkey, which developed in different periods. Two neighbourhoods with a traditional street pattern and one modern housing unit of middle- and high-income groups are compared through using space syntax analysis, snapshot observations, questionnaires, focus groups and interviews. The results of the correlations between space syntax analysis and observations revealed that while movement is correlated with global and local streets in city centres, it is more related to local streets and to the connectivity of the street pattern in sub-centres. Stationary activities are mostly related to highly connected streets in traditional neighbourhoods. Therefore connectivity is very important regarding in-between spaces as well as landuse. These features also support the frequency of social interaction outdoors. In modern settlements, long-duration activities and movements are less strongly correlated than in traditional neighbourhoods. The results of this study support the arguments developed by those urban sociologists and environmental psychologists, who argue that physical space may provide for social interactions, but not yet for a sense of community. The results of the empirical analysis refuted the hypothesis that modernist housing estates would reveal lower sense of community. Although modern housing units support introverted lifestyles and lack of in-between spaces compared to traditional and mixed use neighbourhoods, the results of the survey proved a higher sense of community compared to that in the traditional ones. The research therefore proved that developing sense of community and neighbouring are related with various factors other than mere organisation of space, which have to be taken into account both by urban design and space syntax analyses.",1685020654,,Dissertations & Theses," Can, Is¸inCanIs¸inCan, Is¸in", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3702152621 , 80734832 , 101309 , U636359 , U636359 , http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/12637/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685020654?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," Architecture , Urban planning"," http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/12637/ , (UMI)AAIU636359 , Social sciences , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In-between+space+and+social+interaction%3A+a+case+study+of+three+neighbourhoods+in+izmir&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Can%2C+Is%C2%B8in&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Power, profit, and principles: industry opportunity structures and the political mobilisation of jewellers","This thesis focuses on the creation of private environmental and social regulation through the interaction of non-state actors in the US market for gold jewellery. By investigating the role of business actors in the development of private regulation through their cooperation and contestation with civil society activists, this study brings a business power lens to the study of non-state institution-building. It focuses on a new case and elaborates on current understandings of ‘industry opportunity structures’ (IOSs), taking a model built for the study of social movements and applying it to business actors. It seeks to treat agents from the private sector as political actors in their own right and traces the effects of industry structures on the emergence, development, and impact of the political mobilisation of ethical, specialty, and diversified jewellers. It argues that business actors face different opportunities for political leverage during the private institution-building process depending on the nature of the firm within which they are embedded. It helps explain the variation observed in firm responses to activist contestation while informing debates over the broader implications of the increasing emergence of private regulation in the global economy. Business actors are embedded agents, subject to the constraints of industry structures and market forces. Opportunities for business actors to mobilise firm resources for political purposes varies with the opportunity window available to them, which expands or contracts with the politicisation of the market. Therefore, contrary to previous interpretations, civil society contestation can actually empower institutional entrepreneurs from the private sector to shape the regulatory landscape. While market forces privilege ‘business interests’, and business power safeguards the autonomy of industry, through learning and leadership there appears to be a cumulative effect to contentious politics that has the potential to ratchet-up private regulation in both its depth and breadth of coverage.",1687709160,,Dissertations & Theses," Bloomfield, MichaelBloomfieldMichaelBloomfield, Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713032411 , 96792762 , 101309 , U640281 , U640281 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/528/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687709160?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0601 International Relations, International Relations," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/528/ , (UMI)AAIU640281 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Power%2C+profit%2C+and+principles%3A+industry+opportunity+structures+and+the+political+mobilisation+of+jewellers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bloomfield%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The discursive construction of discrimination: the representation of ethnic diversity in the korean public service broadcasting news,"Globalisation has intensified the international movement of labour and South Korea is no exception. Korea, which in the past was itself a labour-exporting country, has seen a reversal in human mobility since the late 1990's with a rapid growth in immigration and a transformation of a previously almost ethnically homogenous society. However, studies on migrant and ethnic minority groups in Korea have primarily focussed on such areas as industrial law and social policy. In this context, the important questions about the cultural and political implications associated with the construction of minority representations in the media have remained highly unexplored. The starting point of this study is an examination of the vital role of public service broadcasting (PSB) in Korean society, where ethnic minorities have increasingly become visible. Korean PSB's mandate, following the BBC model, emphasises the broadcaster‟s responsibility to represent and reflect the range of public opinion and experiences beyond class, age, ethnicity and ideological orientation. Despite this commitment what this study shows is that PSB in South Korea has failed to fairly represent the culturally diverse groups within Korean society. The main purpose of this study is to empirically examine the means through which PSB generates discourses of We-ness and Otherness at times of change in the Korean society. Empirically, the study focuses on primetime PSB news visual and textual representations of migrants and ethnic minorities. With the use of critical discourse analysis (CDA) it demonstrates that PSB gives a concrete form to the ideological constructions of Otherness, sometimes transforming subtle cultural or social differences into fundamental and oppositional ones. Korean PSB appears to be ideologically biased toward nationalism, while in its visual and textual representations it constructs ideological systems of social and racial stratification, with Southeast Asian migrants constantly represented as the ultimate Others. The study shows the significant role of PSB in representing cultural diversity in public debates and the ways in which such representations and their dissemination reflect media power.",1687711491,,Dissertations & Theses," Joo, JaewonJooJaewonJoo, Jaewon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713033201 , 96793122 , 101309 , U638076 , U638076 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/344/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687711491?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/344/ , (UMI)AAIU638076 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+discursive+construction+of+discrimination%3A+the+representation+of+ethnic+diversity+in+the+korean+public+service+broadcasting+news&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Joo%2C+Jaewon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Beyond the governance state: aid relations and state reforms in the democratic republic of congo,"The Democratic Republic of Congo has been engaged since 2001 in a triple transition process towards liberalisation, democratisation, and peace. Throughout this movement, external actors (donors, international financial institutions, the UN system, aid agencies) have played a leading role, effectively setting the orientations and modalities of this transition, including their institutional dimension. Congolese actors have not been passively subjected to this process, however, but have potently shaped it in various ways. This thesis sets out to investigate the relationship between international aid partners and various Congolese actors. It examines this relationship as an aspect of the state reform process, with particular reference to the administration. The thesis argues that the pace and nature of reform has been compromised by the contradictions inherent within the process itself, as advocated by international partners, and by the ability of Congolese power holders to accommodate and co-opt such reforms in line with their own political strategies. This situation is not unprecedented, as shown by an incursion into Zaire's politico-administrative history, especially during the decades of structural adjustment. An examination of the politics of administrative reform in the last decade, as well as the compromises generated in other reform areas, poignantly illustrate the accommodative dynamics arising out of the political strategies of donors and the Congolese authorities. On the one hand, donors have been content pushing forward a vast array of state reforms, but have been reluctant to follow them through; additionally, they have misconceived Congolese social and political dynamics, and have been prone to tacitly accommodate poor results and inconclusive outcomes. The Congolese authorities - and especially the presidency - have navigated reforms following political strategies often aligned to preoccupations of political expediency and power consolidation which the democratisation context has exacerbated. These features of the aid relationship in Congo provide strong grounds for a critique of dominant tropes of interpretation of the Congo's reform landscape, which revolve around the absence of political will, inadequate ownership, or reform failure. Instead, much of the above points towards the fact that the nature of the relations tying the Congo to its international partners is better grasped as one of accommodation and compromise: despite the dismay of donors, this situation - which is partly of their own making - has not led to withdrawal, suggesting that continued engagement rests on the strategic importance of Congo, in terms of security and the safeguarding of past and present involvement - ranging from the securing of stability to the definition of development policies.",1774182231,,Dissertations & Theses," Moshonas, StylianosMoshonasStylianosMoshonas, Stylianos", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989166271 , 103020482 , 101309 , 10019154 , 10019154", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774182231?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10019154 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+the+governance+state%3A+aid+relations+and+state+reforms+in+the+democratic+republic+of+congo&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moshonas%2C+Stylianos&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A space to house nothing: examining the spatial complexities of nothingness, emptiness, zero and void to define the space of nothing, through the adoption of architectural themes and forms of representation in selected conceptual art projects since 1958","In reference to Yves-Alain Bois and Rosalind Krauss in Formless: A User's Guide, 1997, which maps out a third area between the traditional dichotomy of form and content in the visual arts as originally suggested by Georges Bataille, this thesis looks at the notion of the Space of Nothing as a third space between form and content through the case study of Yves Kleinʼs gallery-emptying Le Vide - The Specialisation of Sensibility in the Raw Material of Stabilised Pictorial Sensibility 1958. This thesis is based on the realisation that artists since the birth of the conceptual art movement in the late 1950s, with specific later reference to the dematerialisation of the art object as defined by Lucy R. Lippard in 1967, have continued to explore spatial definition by directly adopting themes and forms of representation taken from architectural practice to describe concept-based and often immaterial, artworks. This is exemplified by the title of Roberta Smithʼs review of Michael Asherʼs project for the Santa Monica Museum of Art for The New York Times, March 2008 titled How Art is Framed: Exhibition floor plans as a conceptual medium. “The gray volumes of conceptualism are filled with somber ciphers which express primarily the inexpressibility of socially critical thought in the form of art. They embody a terrible contradiction. These artists attempted to break out of the prison house of the art business, its bureaucracy and architecture, and to turn toward social life. But in that process they reassumed the very emptiness they wished to put behind them,” Jeff Wall, 1988 [i] The core interest of this thesis lies in a theoretical reading of the spatial within conceptual art, the art of the immaterial. Can the experience of an artwork that is immaterial become corporealized? The titular reference to the verb to house in A Space to House Nothing is to be understood directly as; to accommodate nothing; to store nothing; to shelter nothing. It does not reference notions of the domestic or the home, nor do gender politics or such readings of the home as a site of gender rules play any role. Can the Space of Nothing be defined as an architectural site? The adoption of architectural themes and forms of representation are evident in the career of Dan Graham, yet his work is overtly concerned with multiplicity and the multi-layering of psychosis and the interweaving of viewer and participant. Although there is a natural overlap with regard to the architectural form of his work, the motivation is oblique to the focus of this thesis, which is centred on the use of the Space of Nothing as an architectural device. Lines of enquiry are considered in reference to Yves Kleinʼs Le Vide - The Specialisation of Sensibility in the Raw Material of Stabilised Pictorial Sensibility, 1958 as the genesis on which the research is sited. Theoretical analysis is examined through four key terms - nothingness, emptiness, zero and void. These terms are surveyed through mathematics, philosophy and language to create a theoretical model; the Space of Nothing (Chapter I). The new term is further explored through a series of specific classifications that catalogue artistic approaches to the Space of Nothing: doing nothing, mapping nothing, framing nothing, occupying nothing and listening to nothing (Chapter II: Strategies Toward Nothing). Artworks of this nature are often misunderstood as an extreme form of pure abstraction based on reductivist and formalist tenets or simply considered nihilistic. However, through spatial theory and the contexts of experience, memory and occupation (Chapter III: Nothing within Spatial Theory), the thesis establishes that the Space of Nothing can be read as complex, emotive and multi-faceted. As a practicing curator of contemporary art, it became important to understand curating as a spatial practice (Chapter IV: The Practice of Nothing). The major project NOTHINGNESS, a touring European exhibition of work by 25 major international artists, examined the premise of this thesis and acted as a visual record of enquiry of selected art projects. The exhibition opened at Galerie Eugen Lendl in Graz, Austria (8 Oct - 27 Nov, 2004) and later toured to Galerija Gregor Podnar, Ljubljana, Slovenia (25 Feb - 2 Apr, 2005) and was accompanied by a hardback illustrated catalogue (English/German) and published and distributed by Revolver Books, Frankfurt. The design research is further supported by additional curated projects including DAN GRAHAM: PERFORMANCE at Lisson New Space (12 July - 28 Aug, 2004), and site-specific installations and theoretical models as contributions to academic conferences and symposia, that explore the temporal nature of materiality, interior, void, boundary and frame.

This poverty-driven activity has been associated with elevated levels of environmental degradation, a high degree of informality, poor health and safety practices and below market prices for their gold. Despite these putatively conceived problems, there has been a historical and widespread failure by policy makers to significantly improve thesocio-economic and environmental conditions facing ASM’s operators. Recently, however, there has been a noticeable shift in the ways in which the governance of the sector is enacted. This thesis critically analyses the emergence of one such example, namely the Fairtrade Labelling Organistion and the Alliance for Responsible Mining’s dual launch of ‘Fairtrade’ and ‘Fairmined’ (FT/FM) certified gold. Inspired by the past successes for the movement in a range of agrifood products and grounded in the discourse of ‘fairness’, its application to ASM promises better prices in exchange for the fulfilment of standards relating to environmental stewardship,a commitment to democratic structures and responsible mining practices. Following the experiences of Fairtrade gold in nine pilot projects in Latin America, its expansion into gold producing countries in sub-Saharan African countries seems inevitable. However, there has been a lack of academic research into its efficacy, a gap that this thesis fills by examining the potential of both the discursive and material ways that Fairtrade and Fairmined gold may operate in Tanzania. It is revealed that ASM operators are negatively represented by conventional thinking as variously criminal, irresponsible and irrational. Against this background, it is argued that the intervention of FT/FM gold can be read through an environmental and social justice framework, one that presents a counter-narrative of ASM as a valued livelihood strategy marked by environmental responsibility. The struggles for greater recognition and more equitable distribution for ASM operators are premised, most critically on a movetowards a new, ‘fair’ way of mining. Building upon a critical examination of the politics of these discursiveconstructs, the thesis presents a critical examination of ‘fairness’ in practice through a case study. Indeed, a private company, African Precious Metals (APM), has constructed four ‘Fair Trade Gold Centres’ that offer ASM operators in the Mwanza and Shinyanga regions of Tanzania a new means of selling gold. Ideologically separate to the FT/FM model outlined above, their presence in local marketing arrangements for ASM gold has served to obscure the way that ‘fairness’ is conceptualised by ASM operators in the area. Moreover, their substantive failure in policy terms, allied to their close rhetorical association with FT/FM, has served to damage the moral ballast of ‘fairness’ found in the ‘Fairtrade’ gold discourse. Through the critical analysis of life histories narrated by ASM operators in Tanzania, this thesis reveals that there is a substantive gap between the ways in which ‘fairness’ in discursively conceptualised and how it is practically realised. Notable findings that compromise FT/FM’s potential efficacy include the fact that the ‘Fair Trade’ price is significantly lower than local market conditions and that, in the light of their historical failure, there is a deeply-rooted mistrust of development intervention more broadly. In struggling for a ‘fair’ future for ASM’s operators, the Fairtrade movement must also remain careful to avoid the paternalism that has defined erstwhile ASM policy that has promoted partnership.",1779949864,,Dissertations & Theses," Childs, JohnChildsJohnChilds, John", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989282261 , 102698092 , 101309 , 10029569 , 10029569 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:145211", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779949864?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:145211 , (UMI)AAI10029569 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fair+trade+gold%3A+a+new+way+of+governing+artisanal+and+small-scale+mining+in+tanzania%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Childs%2C+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The research on china's industrial heritage law in the view of intangible culture,"Translation from original language as provided by author China's modern industry began in the Westernization Movement, now has 150 years of history, some old industries ,such as the Jiangnan manufacturing Bureau, Hanyang iron works, which has along with economic development and social progress have been replaced by the new mode of economic development. The industrial heritage is a history, which makes a large contribution to the development of China's industry. There is a new economic form, the construction of new plants, new equipment and so on. For what mode to protect these in a certain period of special values and making great contribution to the industrial heritage, is a realistic problem for us. The specificity, value, characteristics, protection mode of industrial heritage is in need of our research. How to resolve the practical problem by law, is worth of analysis and discussion. On the protection of industrial heritage, the majority of countries and regions rebuild and reuse it, but its attachment to the industrial heritage body historical value, cultural value, economic value, political value and intangible cultural heritage has not better reflect. Intangible cultural heritage is the tangible material culture as carrier, so to a large extent on the conservation of the industrial heritage is more important than in single or multiple material culture constructed by culture space, exploring its revealed by complete intangible industrial heritage significance. The article related to the industrial heritage industrial heritage research not only remains in the body, but also focuses on the industrial heritage of the intangible cultural properties, and to the western developed countries on the industrial heritage protection model based on the study of China's industrial heritage, with the specific situation in contrast, perspective of intangible cultural heritage and its relevant legal protection. On the protection of industrial heritage is designed to further use and transformation industrial relics that have been abandoned, from the angle of architecture, tourism industrial heritage protection, industrial heritage tourism development, museum, warehouses and other development protection mode. In our country, there are some problems in the industrial heritage protection law, such as confusion, the corresponding protection subject law vacancy, enter the error in the protection and so on, which is caused by the lack of the legal system. The paper analyzes the relevant laws of the industrial heritage in the domestic and international organizations from the "" vertical"" and comparative perspective. It conducts the nationwide industrial heritage census, combined with China's practical conditions, without blindly copy foreign laws, and put forward proposals to improve China's industrial heritage legal protection system with a new vision, new ideas, including the legal protection mode, main body cognizance,"" public participation"" mechanism, standards, qualification and responsibility etc, and in the future will continue to improve",1874547270,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, LiLiLiLi, Li", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318932071 , 111168052 , 189128 , 10516527 , 10516527", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, Chinese, Chinese,,2012,PQDT - Global,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874547270?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10516527 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+research+on+china%27s+industrial+heritage+law+in+the+view+of+intangible+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Li&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Shifting the employment burden: The social and economic foundations of welfare state reform,"This dissertation examines how governments in advanced industrial nations are redefining the social contract through structural transformation of the welfare state, particularly the reform of employment promotion policies. By placing the unemployed back into the labor market, employment promotion not only provides individuals with a source of income, but it also helps to reduce welfare state costs and expand the tax base. Thus, these policies are seen as a sustainable form of social protection by domestic governments and international organizations alike. Yet, methods of employment promotion have changed over time and have varied substantially across countries, particularly in regard to who bears the primary responsibility for finding employment. While some governments have devoted substantial resources to job placement policies, through which the government bears the primary cost and responsibility for employment, many others have reformed employment promotion in such a manner that dramatically shifts employment responsibility onto. I use a two-level argument to demonstrate that the extent and variation in this shift in employment responsibility is rooted both in cleavages within labor markets based on employment risk, as well as in the power of labor unions to enforce workers' demands. At the individual level, I argue that workers' policy preferences are driven by their future employment expectations. Using a formal model of employment policy preferences, I demonstrate that, by contrast to the dominant models of the welfare state, employment risk is a multi-dimensional concept, defined jointly by a worker's job security and reemployability in the event of job loss. Utilizing this multi-dimensional definition of employment risk, I hypothesize that workers with higher skill levels, and those employed in the service sector, should perceive less risk than their lower-skilled and manufacturing sector counterparts. Analysis of employment policy preferences in 13 European countries confirms that these post-industrial cleavages indeed divide worker preferences for employment policies. Having identified the primary cleavages in policy preferences, I develop a new conception of power resource theory to explain how these divisions produce meaningful structural reforms in employment policies that shift the responsibility for finding work from government to individuals, who are increasingly responsible for reemployment. I build on the classic power resource notion that unionized workers are more capable of influencing political outcomes, but I depart from the conventional view that all unionized workers are locked in a class struggle and united in their pro-welfare preferences. Rather, I argue that distributional cleavages extend to all workers and that reforms are shaped by the relative power of high employment risk workers. Accordingly, the extent to which labor market reforms shift the employment burden to individuals is shaped by the degree to which workers who are both unionized and have low employment expectations comprise a greater proportion of the labor force. Analysis of data on the restructuring of employment policies in 18 OECD countries confirms that risk-based distributional cleavages both within the labor force as well as within the union movement play a crucial role in government decisions to shift responsibility to individuals for finding employment.",925813470,,Dissertations & Theses," Powell, Scott RichardPowellRichardScottPowell, Scott Richard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2600502281 , 67756562 , 66569 , 9781267190376 , 3497705 , 3497705", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267190376, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/925813470?accountid=14496," 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy",," 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," Public administration , Public policy , Employment , Social psychology , Economic policy , Welfare , Reforms , Government"," Social sciences , Employment promotion , Power resource , Social contract , Welfare reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Shifting+the+employment+burden%3A+The+social+and+economic+foundations+of+welfare+state+reform&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Powell%2C+Scott+Richard&amp;isbn=9781267190376&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Hucksters and Trucksters: Criminalization and Gentrification in New York City's Street Vending Industry,"The expansion of the informal economy since the 1970s developed in tandem with a growing militarization of urban public space, creating extreme precarity for street vendors, a leading occupational group within the informal sector. Based on over three years of participant observation and seventy interviews with street vendors and their advocates, this dissertation examines the present-day street vending industry in New York City, which has long been comprised of first-generation immigrants, but has in recent years seen a marked growth in highly educated, native-born gourmet food truck owners. The research illustrates how two processes, inherent to what I term the post-industrial complex, are increasing stratification within New York's street economy. First, there is a dramatic criminalization of immigrant street vendors who regularly encounter arrests and ticketing. This blocks their upward mobility, most acutely for women, and locates vendors in a liminal class position, possessing elements of proprietorship that are subjugated by the governance of public space. Second, a new wave of commercial gentrification has occurred within street vending, where more affluent native-born vendors are able to effectively capitalize on vending to rapidly establish brick-and-mortar businesses, and in so doing inflate the price of vending permits in the underground economy. These divergent conditions reveal how the governance of post-industrial urban space reinforces the criminalization of poor and working class people of color, while facilitating the advancement of more affluent and predominantly white professionals. The streets of the post-industrial complex are policed as a border for immigrant vendors, and are pioneered as a frontier by native-born food truck owners. Yet criminalization has produced street vendor solidarities, evidenced in a growing street labor movement amongst immigrant vendors in New York. Like most vendor organizations across the Global South, two immigrant street vendor worker centers in New York press the municipal government to uphold vendors' right to the city. In contrast, the city's native-born food truck owners have established a business association not to achieve social justice but to increase profitability. Post-industrial urban governance thus deepens inequalities within the informal economy while spurring new movements to claim the enduring resource of urban public space.",1315219420,,Dissertations & Theses," Dunn, KathleenDunnKathleenDunn, Kathleen", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2911183231 , 76081662 , 66569 , 9781267930415 , 3553554 , 3553554", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267930415, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1315219420?accountid=14496," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure"," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure"," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure",," 0627 Criminology , 0700 Social structure"," Criminology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Criminalization , Gentrification , Hucksters , New York City , Street vending",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hucksters+and+Trucksters%3A+Criminalization+and+Gentrification+in+New+York+City%27s+Street+Vending+Industry&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dunn%2C+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9781267930415&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Evolution by textual selection: The literary representation of the Galápagos Islands,"This dissertation takes a literary and cultural studies model to explain the textual representation of these unique islands since their discovery until present day. The main argument suggests that the depiction of this crucial space for modernity in Western thought, given the rhetoric of travel and fiction writers, deploys the insular area with the intention of conceiving new forms of political displacement and identity endeavors in addition to those of the nation building project that took place in the mainland. As a result of colonial enterprises, scientific excursions, exile, tourism, journalistic pieces, expeditions, etc., travel writings of the Galápagos record the experience of reshaping this space à propos of a theory of travel and travel writing mediated by narratives that complement the formation of the state and its national imagery. The insular space functions as a vacant signifier where travelers are able to communicate their own signified upon narrating the experiences of their journeys. This phenomenon creates a profound conceptual and political division between the identity of the isles and the nation of Ecuador, and the findings of this study can be extrapolated to a historical specificity of explorations and representations that deal with narrative constructions of highly condensed spaces throughout Latin America as a whole, if one can claim they are a case study of an ""unfinished"" modernity. This separation created a rupture leading to fundamental variations in the manner in which local inhabitants and foreign entities interpret the insular province nowadays. The literature of the Galápagos reflects the scale of friction, migratory tendencies into the islands, and how global interests prevail in the appropriation of the space, reshaping the subjective individuality of the host culture. The first chapter examines texts of discovery written during the colonial enterprise of Spain. Given the anthropological void in the Galápagos, these initial pieces of writing emphasize the monstrosity of the landscape and the biota, but also portray a possibility to find riches. This description ignites a dichotomist infernal-paradisiacal appraisal of the archipelago, and recreates it as a warped textual space which, in turn, develops an imagery that demonstrates the flexibility of the deserted island: writers set forth almost any form of representation that favors imperial interests. The second chapter analyzes travel literature written in English during the nineteenth century. These texts define the islands as a world within itself rather than as a province of Ecuador, and have a major impact on its imagery given the authority of its writers. In the midst of Latin-American independence, the nation-building project, and the quest for a cosmopolitan state, foreign texts are detached from the social and political reality of the entourage, and transmit a fallacious notion of desertedness, which allows for future occupations of transcontinental scope. These books also create a bilingual literature that preludes the migratory movement and touristic commerce that currently defines this province. The final chapter focuses on three books written by local authors and how they combat or appropriate previous insular narratives providing a native perspective. A historiographical novel, defined as a ""foundational fiction"" that portrays the Galápagos as a prison and pirate hideout, exhibits the violent environment of the newborn Ecuadorian Republic. This piece generates a fissure in the international community that regards the islands as paradise and still is, therefore, largely ignored. A second narrative shows how the Galápagos occupation of the United States during World War II is crucial for interpreting and understanding the archipelago during the twentieth century. It preludes current international interests that dominate policy-undertakings, particularly the ones concerning tourism, environmental, and geopolitical endeavors. Finally, a quarto book exemplifies how texts have enticed and caused not only a critical political and national divorce between the nation and the insular region, but also a market-oriented global milieu triggering migration towards this zone. The discussed works include Tomás de Berlanga's ""Carta a su majestad describiendo su viaje"" (1535), Sarmiento de Gamboa's Historia de los incas (1572), Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle (1839), Melville's The Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles (1854), Manuel Bilbao's El pirata del Guayas (1855), Bolívar Naveda's Galápagos a la vista (1952), and Hugo Idrovo's Galápagos: huellas en el paraíso (2005).

This could result in major economic losses and social disruption unless these communities proactively plan for the impacts of a changing climate. As a small state with a large coastal population, Rhode Island is highly vulnerable to impacts from climate change, thus the state is positioned to act as a potential leader in a national movement towards proactive adaptation. It is clear that actions must be taken, however implementing effective policy changes requires significant political will as well as the support of decision makers and communities. This case study assesses municipal officials' perceptions of the risks sea level rise and increased storminess pose to North Kingstown, Rhode Island and analyzes the relationship between town decision makers' understanding of climate change risk and adaptive planning behavior. Evaluation of local decision makers' mental models concerning climate change knowledge and perceptions of risk will provide insights for those working with town decision makers to proactively incorporate adaptation actions in town comprehensive and capital improvement planning. Results of this research display no correlation between local decision makers' levels of climate change knowledge and their individual preparatory behavior or between personal adaptive behavior and levels of support for proactive municipal adaptation. A strong correlation was found between individuals with mental models closely matching the expert model of climate change knowledge and levels of support for municipal adaptation planning and actions. Additionally, this study found a moderate correlation between subjects' exposure to climate change information and levels of support for municipal adaptation. Increasing awareness of the risks associated with impacts of climate change through improved communication, educational programs, and public outreach is likely to be an effective way of promoting proactive adaptation in vulnerable coastal communities.",1351343599,,Dissertations & Theses," Rubin, ClaraRubinClaraRubin, Clara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2970751941 , 78546302 , 66569 , 9781303030123 , 1535868 , 1535868", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303030123, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1351343599?accountid=14496," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0404 Climate Change"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0404 Climate Change"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0404 Climate Change",," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0404 Climate Change"," Behavioral psychology , Climate Change"," Psychology , Earth sciences , Adaptation , Behavior change , Climate change , Municipal adaptation , Risk analysis , Risk assessment",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rising+tides+and+changing+attitudes%3A+Community+adaptive+planning+and+behavior+change+in+North+Kingstown%2C+Rhode+Island&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rubin%2C+Clara&amp;isbn=9781303030123&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Unsettling Solidarities: Asian North American and Indigenous Literary Contacts, Post-1968","""Unsettling Solidarities"" examines Asian North American and Indigenous solidarities, alliances, and interactions imagined in the contemporary literatures of these two communities, tracing how these moments of literary contact reveal the vexed dynamics of race and resistance after the mid-twentieth century. Emerging out of anti-colonial and anti-racist movements of the 1950-70s, narratives by Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Leslie Marmon Silko grapple with the limits of identity-based cultural politics, articulating in its their place different collectivities and ethical relations that can account for the increasing stratifications of power within and across racial identities. The dissertation tracks the aesthetically diverse ways these writers imagine their own and each other's communities within their revised cultural politics, and argues that the ambivalent depictions register these communities' differential yet mutually constitutive histories and critical visions for social justice. Recent scholarship in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies has posited a comparative framework—within and between communities of difference—for apprehending the shifting localities, agents, and processes of settler colonial distributions of life and (vulnerabilities to) death. Such analytics have become urgent within the context of (neo)liberal multiculturalism and its selective recognition of cultural difference as the condition of possibility for new global economic restructuring for inequities. Asian/Indigenous convergences, in particular, bring to the fore how civil rights frameworks can elide Indigenous experiences, perpetuating discursive erasures of settler colonial conditions. The dissertation's project foregrounds these tensions, attending to their biopolitical and affective dimensions, as they are revealed, negotiated, and metonymically reproduced within the narratives. By investigating the intersecting affective economies of Asian/Indigenous interaction, imagined at various geopolitical sites (such as Hawai`i, the U.S./Mexico Border, Canada, and Brazil), this study connects intimate and localized specificities of racial formations to broader networks of settler national configurations.",1355105879,,Dissertations & Theses," Le, Quynh Nhu ThiLeNhu ThiQuynhLe, Quynh Nhu Thi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2978709661 , 78993012 , 66569 , 9781303052408 , 3559812 , 3559812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303052408, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1355105879?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Comparative literature , Asian American Studies , American literature , Ethnic studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , American ethnic literature , Comparative race studies , Critical ethnic studies , Indigenous studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unsettling+Solidarities%3A+Asian+North+American+and+Indigenous+Literary+Contacts%2C+Post-1968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Le%2C+Quynh+Nhu+Thi&amp;isbn=9781303052408&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Arab uprisings and the unveiling of the Shiite Crescent,"The Arab uprisings which began in December of 2010 in Tunisia are until today making history. These uprisings forever changed the Middle East by deposing longstanding dictators in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, and Libya. As Sunni led regimes were being toppled by the will of the people, Shiite leaders in the region joined the international community in applauding the efforts of activists. The organization and determination of common individuals, demanding a higher quality of life and rejecting dictatorships, were widespread. Evidence of social movements and protests were seen all across the region. Though, these events overwhelmingly only affected Sunni ruled states. This drastically changed in March of 2011 when protests reached Syria. The situation in Syria quickly escalated into an extremely violent conflict, resembling civil war. While the international community was in an uproar, surprisingly the few entities supporting Assad were the very ""pioneers of justice"" and ""defenders of the oppressed"": Hezbollah and its regional supporter, Iran. The extreme violence in Syria brought deep hypocrisies to the surface. The mass killings and reign of terror which the Assad regime unleashed on its civilian population called into question the duplicitous loyalties of these actors. These parties have defended Bashar al-Assad politically and supplied him militarily. Due to the situation in Syria, the fraudulent ideologies and allegiances of these entities has been exposed. The following discussion examines the recent Arab uprisings and traces the growth of the Shiite Crescent from its initial beginnings until the present, establishing that while the Shiite Crescent has purported a focus on Islam and ending oppression, its current actions with regard to Syria have exposed this group's true priority: an aspiration for geopolitical survival and growth. Today, this hypocrisy is hindering the future of the Shiite Crescent. The impact of Iran and Hezbollah's decision to stand with Bashar al-Assad, coupled with the threat of Assad losing power is transforming the region. Syria is remarkable on several levels as the outcome of regime change will shift the regional balance of power radically. The gains which the Shiite pillar of strength made in recent years due to the growth and popularity of Hezbollah, and the removal of Saddam Hussein from Iraq are now being threatened. Without Syria, Iran and Hezbollah will be drastically weakened both regionally and internationally. Furthermore, if Bashar al-Assad is replaced by either a Sunni or Salafist regime, the Shiite Crescent will likely lose the major conduit which unites the axis of resistance. The following analysis examines the growth of the Shiite Crescent and the various disingenuous methods which this alliance has used in an attempt to strengthen its regional position. I will discuss the fact that today these advances are being challenged due to the exposure of the group's fraudulent principles. Speeches from Hassan Nasrallah, Bashar al-Assad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other key regional political figures will be drawn upon in order to characterize the position of key figures representing the Shiite Crescent. This discussion also uses journalistic accounts from American and Arab newspapers, as well as scholarly writings from historians and analysts such as Hala Jaber and Martin Kramer. In closing I will discuss how these realities have established that the Shiite Crescent is not exceedingly different from the West, a fact extremely contrary to the propaganda and half-truths which the group disseminates.

This dissertation demonstrates that the interest of many speakers in revitalizing the indigenous Mexican language Highland Oaxaca Chontal is connected to their faith as Jehovah's Witnesses, a new religious movement rooted in the global North. At the time of research, Witness religious meetings were the only high-status context—and the only public context—in which Chontal was consistently used. Moreover, new indexical connections between language and religion position knowledge of the language as a moral imperative rather than a matter of individual choice. That is, local Jehovah's Witnesses have begun using more Chontal as speaking this language has come to index devoutness. This religion is highly centralized and standardized: Witnesses obeyed instructions to use Chontal because these instructions bore the authority of the Watch Tower Society institution. This dissertation proposes the concept of the globalizing textual community, which synthesizes understandings of community from throughout social science literature, in order to explain how religious identity can supersede national, ethnic, and linguistic identities. In particular, I consider how members define their language practices as shared across externally imposed boundaries between language varieties. I build on Anderson's (1983) fundamental insight about the affordances of written texts to consider how translations are framed as commensurate or even identical, using community members' own logic as a guide. A textual regime of shared reading and shared literacy practices unites this community. If written texts afford standardization not only of content but also of literacy and mediational practices, translation represents the potential to challenge it. One chief mechanism for minimizing these challenges is the transidiomatic authoritative discourse of the ""pure language."" Other mechanisms include a variety of mediational performances (Bauman 2004) of written texts, institutional regulations and consequences, and textual ideologies. This dissertation explores both the particular ethnographic case and the institution behind many of this community's language ideologies and religious practices. I demonstrate that the enactment of Witness religious texts and the moral weight this enactment carries are, ultimately, inseparable from the language in which it is carried out.",1372812079,,Dissertations & Theses," Barchas-Lichtenstein, JenaBarchas-LichtensteinJenaBarchas-Lichtenstein, Jena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3009176061 , 80208672 , 66569 , 9781303101434 , 3562484 , 3562484", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303101434, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1372812079?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0636 Sociolinguistics",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Sociolinguistics"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christianity , Language ideologies , Language revitalization , Mexico , Oaxaca Chontal , Textual community",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22When+the+dead+are+resurrected%2C+how+are+we+going+to+speak+to+them%3F%22%3A+Jehovah%27s+Witnesses+and+the+Use+of+Indigenous+Languages+in+the+Globalizing+Textual+Community&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barchas-Lichtenstein%2C+Jena&amp;isbn=9781303101434&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The trouble with women: The Catholic Church, gender politics, and the West German public, 1959–1989","""The Trouble with Women: The Catholic Church, Gender Politics, and the West German Public, 1959-1989"" analyzes the West German Catholic Church's confrontation with secular and religious social movements on sexual morality and gender equality beginning in the 1960s. The dissertation challenges the application of the secularization thesis for West Germany and posits a new chronology for Catholicism – one with significant implications for the history of Catholicism and of gender politics in late twentieth-century Europe. In 1945, the German Catholic Church emerged triumphant from the ruins of war. With secular institutions destroyed and the strongholds of Protestantism under Soviet occupation, the Catholic Church exercised considerable influence over the initial make-up of the administrative superstructure at all levels in the Western zones. Through its close collaboration with the new Christian Democratic Party, the Catholic Church also succeeded in having most of its demands incorporated into the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany, including an invocation of God in the preamble, an affirmation of a right to life; religious instruction in the schools; the protection of marriage and family; and acknowledgement of the validity of past concordats signed between the Catholic Church and the German State. In doing so, the ghettoized Catholic Church of Bismarck's Kulturkampf established itself as a parastatal organization with significant influence over state policy and society. Yet, within two decades, Catholic hierarchs had lost much of their moral and political authority and the insulated German Catholic milieu lay in ruins. In eradicating the boundary between the political and the moral, Catholic hierarchs unwittingly drew the Church into the vortex of a crisis of authority, as a wave of secular and religious social movements emerged that challenged institutional authority and made the politicization of sexual relations, albeit in very different ways, the focal point of their campaigns. Accustomed to dictating the moral and political behavior of its congregants, the institutional Church at first refused to change, counting on the loyalty of its core constituency – women. But Catholic women like their secular counterparts had new ideas. Catholic women in postwar West Germany sought to renegotiate their relationship with the Church. They demanded a more active role in Church ministries, called for the democratization of the Church, and challenged the Church's hierarchical and gendered conception of marriage. In particular, they resented the condemnation of artificial contraception by a male, celibate priesthood. When the Church refused to compromise, they left the Church en masse . Those who stayed – liberal and conservative – often followed the Church's teachings selectively, creating spaces within the West German Catholic Church that respectively eschewed patriarchal authority or placed a hyper-valuation on papal loyalty and woman's emulation of the Virgin Mary. The stakes of this debate could not have been higher. In rejecting the Church's gendered and hierarchical concept of marriage, protesters challenged the structure and authority of the church. Moreover, the interpenetration of theological arguments employed by Church hierarchs to justify celibacy and to condemn birth control resulted in a cascading series of crises that eventually encompassed abortion, women's ordination, and new reproductive technologies. But out of this crisis of authority, a much more activist, albeit smaller, Catholic community emerged. For the majority of these ardent believers, activism meant promoting the moral values championed by the Vatican in the secular and religious sphere. For a minority, it meant a profound commitment to loyal dissent. For these Catholics, disillusionment with the hierarchy did not translate into a loss of piety; instead it entailed redefining what it meant to be Catholic. Groups such as Kirche von unten (Church from Below) and Wir Sind Kirche (We Are Church) underscored the centrality of the laity in Catholicism, rather than the traditional focus on hierarchy. In turn, the protests of the ""loyal opposition"" served as a call to action for the conservative core. This conservative core proved both resilient and flexible, slowly developing new strategies within the religious and secular sphere to promote its agenda. This learning process had not proceeded in a linear fashion nor to date has it extended to all political and religious issues in which German Catholic Church is embroiled. Moreover, it has not meant abandoning Catholic doctrine on sexual morality championed by the Vatican. Rather for Catholic leaders, it has entailed a subtle shift. Neither German historians nor historians of gender can afford to ignore this subtle shift. With its actively engaged minority, significant financial resources, and international connections, the German Catholic community has proved politically adroit, succeeding in introducing revisions to abortion law (2009) and limiting research on embryonic stem cells and access to pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (2011).

I argue that the world is becoming more aware of cosmopolitan courts (courts that look beyond provincial law when deciding domestic cases). The dissertation relies on three different original qualitative data sets. The first is an analysis of speeches delivered by justices of the Supreme Court focused on understanding how they legitimate their citations to foreign law. The analysis reveals that the justices understand the use of foreign law as a means of legal learning and judicial diplomacy. The second data set is a collection of the universe of foreign and international opinions that have cited to the US Supreme Court's landmark school desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education . A content analysis of these data reveal that foreign court's citation to Brown has led to legal innovation in judicial decisions. Additionally, I conduct a qualitative content analysis of the Senate confirmation hearings of US Supreme Court nominees Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan and typologize the ways in which politicians reference and characterize judicial use of foreign law. This analysis explores American politicians´ to a backlash to cosmopolitan activities which has led to the social transformation of foreign law into a dangerous stranger. Drawing on the work of Georg Simmel, I label the product of the transformation of foreign law as strange laws. The dissertation links this transformation to other conservative movements that have constructed foreign national immigrants as illegal strangers who should be feared. My work argues that foreign laws and decisions are a new American stranger.",1426182403,,Dissertations & Theses," Lyke, Sheldon BernardLykeBernardSheldonLyke, Sheldon Bernard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3048834551 , 80910122 , 66569 , 9781303231674 , 3568558 , 3568558", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303231674, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1426182403?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure",," 0398 Law , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," Law , International law , Social structure"," Social sciences , Cosmopolitanism , Courts , Foreign law , Globalization , Law , Social resistance , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cosmopolitan+courts+and+strange+laws%3A+Essays+on+judicial+globalization+and+the+social+resistance+to+foreign+law&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lyke%2C+Sheldon+Bernard&amp;isbn=9781303231674&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Chinese Migration to Central Asia: Contrasting Experiences between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,"This paper argues that state and institutional processes are intertwined with ground-level interactions to create circumstances for Chinese migrants to either accept or reject the authority of their host environments. Contrasting host country models of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are examined to offer predictions about how PRC migration functions on a regional and global scale. Variance in state-level and subnational responses will ultimately impact the environment in which Chinese assets and migrants must function in. By nature of their political and economic environments, each country has a unique relationship with China. Kazakhstan is a key resource farm and transit zone for China. A substantial Chinese migrant population continues to grow in Kazakhstan, but its presence is not overt. Social disruption is rare. Kazakhstan's central political authority and high per capita GDP usually are effective at deterring public contention. Kyrgyzstan serves as the region's wholesale market for affordable Chinese consumer goods. Chinese migrants, goods, and investments in Kyrgyzstan interact with society on a much more noticeable level. Violent disputes occasionally arise between Chinese migrants and Kyrgyzstanis. In a decentralized state with weak economic development, uncertainty surrounding China's growing influence continues to channel resentment against Chinese interests. A sense of urgency compels Chinese interactions with Central Asia from a standpoint of national interest. China's demographic imbalance means that its dense population centers are reaching capacity. Central Asia is a strategic and growing source of energy, market access, and business opportunities. Moreover, cross-border security and development projects between Xinjiang and the Central Asian states are important to China for mitigating perceived risks of separatism, extremism, and terrorism within its geographic rear. Yet China's ascension to influence in Central Asia is largely inadvertent. Instead of being a single grand strategy, China's actions in the region are organic and market-driven. Change is rapid. The movement of Chinese to and from Central Asia is playing a vital role in determining the future of development and security across the Eurasian landmass. Nonetheless, host countries can and do have an impact on their interactions with China and Chinese migrants in particular. This important observation creates different implications for China's evolving presence both within Central Asia and elsewhere.",1426647636,,Dissertations & Theses," Steiner, Nicholas J.SteinerJ.NicholasSteiner, Nicholas J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3050475951 , 80210932 , 66569 , 9781303272387 , 1542496 , 1542496", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303272387, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1426647636?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Chinese+Migration+to+Central+Asia%3A+Contrasting+Experiences+between+Kazakhstan+and+Kyrgyzstan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Steiner%2C+Nicholas+J.&amp;isbn=9781303272387&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The appeal to be heard and the trope of listening in classic film and African American literature,"This dissertation analyzes the narrative use of sound, the rhetorical appeal to be heard and the trope of listening in African American literature as well as Hollywood and international cinema. Contributing to the burgeoning fields of film sound and listening studies, Chapter One explores the relationship between the first experiments with synchronous sound recording technology and the construction of subjectivity along the lines of ethnicity, religion and gender in early talkies such as Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer and Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail. Chapter Two surveys a range of abolitionist texts and select essays from the Civil Rights movement—particularly David Walker's Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World, Frederick Douglass's first autobiography Narrative of the Life and his novella ""The Heroic Slave,"" W. E. B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk and Richard Wright's White Man, Listen! –in order to review the role of listening across racial divides in the United States. Chapter Three analyzes the multiple ways in which listening functions for narrative purposes in Wright's best-selling novel, Native Son; and Chapter Four addresses the trouble with listening in Wright's posthumous novel A Father's Law and Hitchcock's first color film, Rope. Contributing to film studies, gender studies, and critical race theory, this thesis argues that the act of listening comes to function figuratively as a trope, signifying not only a means of recognition, interpellation and subjugation of an Other but also an instrument of justice; a matter of politics; a means of education; a potential remedy for alienation, while at the same time working as a tool of oppression; a formative act in familial and other social relations; a governing form of surveillance; an audial gaze, so to speak; a way to frighten, or more generally, evoke emotion; a part of the therapeutic process; an indication of trust or confidence; a manifestation of (sexual) desire; and, last but certainly not least, an age old form of entertainment forever transformed by sound technology of the industrial age.",1430904678,,Dissertations & Theses," Kolakoski, MikeKolakoskiMikeKolakoski, Mike", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3066617431 , 81553152 , 66569 , 9781303292132 , 3590009 , 3590009", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303292132, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430904678?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0325 Black studies , 0900 Film studies"," African American Studies , American studies , Black studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , American literature , Classic film , Constructions of subjectivity , Douglass, Frederick , Du Bois, W.

Is the Arabic language (standard), or its colloquial variants (dialects), part of the explanation, and to what extent? In a December 31, 2011 YouTube posting, Al-Arabiya spotlights language as a critical component of the Arab Spring uprisings. In countries where certain kinds of speech and particularly anti-regime expression are monitored, regulated, and punishable by both legal and extra-legal means, an imperative like / irHal / (MSA: 'depart') is interpreted by regime security apparatuses as action. Elliot Colla explains that the ""slogans the protestors are chanting are couplets—and they are as loud as they are sharp."" This poetry is ""not an ornament to the uprising,"" but rather it is a veritable ""soundtrack and also composes a significant part of the action itself. "" In the Arab Spring uprisings, then, poets are warriors. Code choices about Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Colloquial Arabic (CA) in the context of the Arab Spring reflect Reem Bassiouney's concept of ""involvement,"" a psycho-social objective related to the speaker's intended level of audience engagement. Its corollary, ""ideation,"" is the ""translation of this aim into different types of discourse."" In the Arab Spring, involvement is a choice the chanter makes after determining a communicative aim and then decides upon a method of ideation, and finally arrives at a code choice based on her/his perception of the intended audience. This analysis argues that there is an illocutionary element at play in the ""travel"" of the revolutionary chants, and therewith its requisite sentiments and objectives, across Arab state borders. The chants are designed to increase public engagement and sustain the tenor of the uprisings in order to provoke the revolutionary movement, or action. The language of the Arab Spring is a critical form of action. The shouted slogans of the demonstrators take the form of couplets with predictable and simple rhyming patterns that set the tone and meter of the protests. These 'couplet-slogans' carry the sentiments and objectives of the revolutionaries across national borders, down streets and alleys, but also transmit the entitlement, the right, the messages, and the impetus to revolt into the mouths and feet of the public at large, but also into lexicons, syntaxes and synapses of spectators who, in turn, are driven to activism. In participating in a protest one understands her/his words to be a form of revolutionary activism, or involvement. In most cases, the language of the Arab Spring slogans has been colloquial Arabic, which, this research argues, contributes to the transnationalism of the uprisings because dialects are perceived to be the authentic speech of ash-sha'b (the people) and therefore travel more easily across borders. With the words of the people echoing across borders, revolutionary action is inspired. This analysis suggests that the chanters in the uprisings believe the revolution to be popular ( sha'bi ) and, while they perceive their audiences to be Arabs of all nationalities, they choose to speak and be moved by colloquial rather than standard Arabic. While the regime speaks MSA, the protestors speak colloquial Arabic to engage locals and use MSA to interact with and spread the revolution regionally.",1444152412,,Dissertations & Theses," Harb Michel, Nazir NaderHarb MichelNaderNazirHarb Michel, Nazir Nader", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3106670481 , 75675612 , 66569 , 9781303402685 , 1545514 , 1545514", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303402685, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1444152412?accountid=14496," 0290 Linguistics , 0615 Political science , 0679 Language"," 0290 Linguistics , 0615 Political science , 0679 Language"," 0290 Linguistics , 0615 Political science , 0679 Language",," 0290 Linguistics , 0615 Political science , 0679 Language"," Linguistics , Political science , Language"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Arab spring , Arabic dialectology , Arabic linguistics , Arabic political discourse , Political discourse analysis , Syria egypt",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22IrHal%21%22%3A+The+role+of+language+in+the+Arab+Spring&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Harb+Michel%2C+Nazir+Nader&amp;isbn=9781303402685&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Riddle of the Commune: Subjectivity and Style in Karl Marx's ""The Civil War in France""","This project reads Karl Marx's The Civil War in France, a speech and pamphlet in which Marx treats the political experience of the Paris Commune. Reading the pamphlet through literature on rhetoric and aesthetics, I argue that Marx's speech performs a political style—a set of tropes which structure thought, political responses, and collective desires—that stands in productive tension with many of the ways his work has been taken up by scholars and activists alike. Over the course of my dissertation I highlight three key concepts in The Civil War in France —debt, history, and community—which, I argue, are both central to the speech's address of its own historical context and useful resources for those seeking to make Marx's work productive in the present. First, Marx highlights the degree to which punitive debt policies directed by the French government at France's poor and disenfranchised contributed to the violence of the Commune and its aftermath, while also asserting a ""debt of gratitude"" to the Commune that he argues should lead a diversity of French political constituencies to support it. Engaging with Andrew King's research on the rhetoric of power maintenance and with contemporary scholarship on the politics of debt, I argue that Marx's address responds to the propaganda leveled against the Commune by the French national government of the period, while also constituting a set of tropes that are useful for analyzing discussions of debt by regulators and activists in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Second, reading Marx's eulogy of the Commune's failure alongside his attempt to draw lessons from it for future political practice, I argue that The Civil War in France provides a compelling case study for scholars concerned with how ""failed"" social movements may become subject to a type of collective memory work that primes them to be rescued as impetuses for future political action. I argue that Marx develops a rhetoric of history that enables a productive rethinking of the current political moment in light of past revolutionary experiences. Finally, engaging with recent debates in rhetorical studies and in the critical humanities on the concept of community, I argue that Marx's speech proleptically critiques the politics of community that goes by the name of neoliberalism, and provides an alternative ethics of community, of which the Commune is a central example. Taken together, I show that these concepts provide a useful set of tools for thinking the economic and political crises attendant on current global capitalism.",1447023365,,Dissertations & Theses," Bost, Matthew WesleyBostWesleyMatthewBost, Matthew Wesley", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3112907811 , 81054782 , 66569 , 9781303427671 , 3596309 , 3596309", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303427671, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1447023365?accountid=14496," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric"," Philosophy , Political science , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Community , Debt , History , Marx, Karl , Paris commune",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Riddle+of+the+Commune%3A+Subjectivity+and+Style+in+Karl+Marx%27s+%22The+Civil+War+in+France%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bost%2C+Matthew+Wesley&amp;isbn=9781303427671&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Geographies of Prayer: Place and Religion in Modern America,"The built environment has been a focus of the study of sacred space for decades. This dissertation examines late twentieth-century evangelical religious practices to show the construction of mobile, geographical, and imagined sacred spaces. The study thus identifies ways that space and spatial logic have become integral to the development of contemporary religion. As the narrative recounts, by the late 1970s increasingly charismatic elements could be seen in mainstream evangelical mission strategies. Followers of two movements—Power Evangelism and Signs and Wonders—claimed they received spiritual gifts that were effective tools for church growth. A number, calling themselves spiritual warriors, began to emphasize their participation in a battle between God and Satan as a precondition for successful evangelism, and in this context mobile practices like prayerwalking became popular as spiritual warfare. In the global March For Jesus praise movement, warriors found that leaving the physical space of a church provided them better access to the sacred spaces most integral to their religious goals. Obstacles to evangelism were often interpreted as the product of territorial demons. This led not only to new practices of mapping that pinpointed the location of demonic strongholds, but also to new conceptions of the world. For spiritual warriors, cultural problems from the past, such as disputes with indigenous peoples, became the source of present-day social problems. Proponents said they were discerning spiritual landscapes hidden in time and space, and then they mapped the results on contemporary places. Finally, as the dissertation argues, the city has been a persistent backdrop for spiritual warfare. Evangelists saw danger and opportunity in the world's growing urbanism. They also focused on the Bible's many urban references. Cities were not only Babylons doomed to God's judgment. They were also Jerichos for God's army to conquer or Jerusalems waiting to be transformed by the coming Kingdom of God.",1448527075,,Dissertations & Theses," McConeghy, David WalkerMcConeghyWalkerDavidMcConeghy, David Walker", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3117893251 , 78954772 , 66569 , 9781303426285 , 3596197 , 3596197", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303426285, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448527075?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion,, 0318 Religion, Religion," Philosophy, religion and theology , American religious history , Evangelicalism , Sacred space , Spiritual warfare",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Geographies+of+Prayer%3A+Place+and+Religion+in+Modern+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McConeghy%2C+David+Walker&amp;isbn=9781303426285&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reconceptualization of democracy from an Islamic subaltern,"This dissertation challenges a dominant trait in contemporary western thought that understands Islamist politics as holistic and antithetical to modernity and democracy; that presents Islamism as an expression of traditionalism in the modern world. I challenge this dominant western perception by asking the question: how have the ideologues and the founders of the most well known Islamic movements of the Muslim world approached democracy, a modern political system, and related it to an Islamic state? Addressing the dynamic relationship between Islamic political thought and socio-political context, with this dissertation, I offer a critique of this literature, which positions the Islamic world as an archaic civilization in an inevitable clash with the West, the representative of modernity. By analyzing the original works of two well-known ideologues of Islamic movements from Indo-Pakistan and Egypt, I depict the ways in which Islamic political thought intervenes in cardinal conversations about democracy. There are four main goals of this dissertation. First, I recover the story of modernity in political thought from the two different parts of the Muslim world. Second, I reveal the voices of Muslim intellectuals in the meaning making and indigenization of a western-originated idea, democracy, into Islam. Third, I challenge a dominant discourse that puts Islam and the West as civilizations in a clash. Fourth, I point out the necessity to engage non-western political theory to enhance our intellectual endeavors and rid the literature of its Eurocentric biases. To achieve these goals, a comparative historical analysis method was utilized based on two cases: Sayyid Qutb and Mawdudi's conceptualization of democracy. In analyzing the data, I employed analytical narrative method in tracing patterns of causal factors as well as in making causal inferences through the comparison between and within these cases. Throughout the study, I pursued a dual analytical agenda, which included examining how each ideologue defined democracy, how these ideologues related democracy and Islam to each other, and how the local and international events and institutions uniquely shaped their ideas regarding democracy. Findings indicate that, both Mawdudi and Qutb opened up the idea of democracy to a new set of critiques and methods of adaptation. For Qutb and Mawdudi, being an imported product of colonial and capitalist world, democracy was not to be implemented to the Muslim world directly. It had to be supplemented with indigenous forms of explanation and interpretation to make sense within existing political realities. Criticizing the slavish imitation of western democracies, they recommended a political system based on local representation. They believed that governments would achieve greater legitimacy if the political structure and language of politics were in line with the culture and beliefs of the people. They emphasized the match between the cultural meanings, values, and beliefs of Islam and democracy. They raised questions regarding certain dogmatic assumptions implicit in the concept, which they identified as part of the secularist/capitalist/colonialist project. Mawdudi and Qutb's works reveals that the western democratic model cannot and should not be replicated in the Muslim world because, at the economic level, it presumes capitalism, and at the social level, it presumes individualism and secularism. Their solution was to create their vernacular political language and terminology to work with the idea of democracy which they named as theodemocracy by Mawdudi and Islamic state by Qutb and strictly refrained from using western terminologies like republican, democratic, or socialist to define their systems.",1448554999,,Dissertations & Theses," Kozak, Aysegul MeryemKozakMeryemAysegulKozak, Aysegul Meryem", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3117980321 , 75914752 , 66569 , 9781303427923 , 3596334 , 3596334", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303427923, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448554999?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0344 Social research , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0344 Social research , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0615 Political science"," Social research , Islamic Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Democracy , Maudoodi, Syed Abul `Ala , Political Islam , Qutb, Sayyid",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reconceptualization+of+democracy+from+an+Islamic+subaltern&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kozak%2C+Aysegul+Meryem&amp;isbn=9781303427923&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The ""future immense"": Race and immigration in the multiracial U.S.-Mexico borderlands, 1880–1936","This study examines the multiple meanings of citizenship and belonging that emerged in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands from 1880 to 1936. The project focuses on El Paso, Texas, the region’s leading hub of economic activity and immigration during this period. Locating El Paso at the crossroads of multiple boundaries – among them the U.S.-Mexico border as well as the limits of Jim Crow, which ended where El Paso met the New Mexico Territory line – I trace the movements of Mexican, Chinese, and African-American men and women to the El Paso-Juárez region. This project presents a new study of the multiracial intersections of the borderlands, as diverse people crossed various borders in search of economic opportunities and freedom from popular and institutionalized racism. The project’s purpose is twofold. First, I examine the developments in immigration law and policy that transformed both the United States and Mexico during these years. Analyzing the emergence of racially restrictive immigration policies in Mexico as well as the United States, the project addresses a variety of legal, social, political, and economic changes affecting migration on both sides of the border as well as across it, including the shift from Reconstruction to Jim Crow in the United States, the modernization programs of President Porfirio Díaz and revolution in Mexico, anti-Chinese exclusion campaigns on both sides of the border, and a global economic depression. Second, I show how racialized people used national borders to renegotiate questions about their capacity for “belonging” in the United States and/or Mexico, thereby forcing redefinitions of citizenship and national identity. I argue that although the border harbored multiple perils, it also offered great promise: through it, Mexican, black, and Chinese subjects often challenged the constructions of their non-whiteness and improvised their own democracy. Integrating sources from both regional and national archives in the United States and Mexico, my project demonstrates the unique ways in which marginalized people used their cross-border mobility to blur the lines of state power and identity in the borderlands. Ultimately, however, the project demonstrates the incremental processes of immigration law-making from both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, and highlights the ways in which binational immigration laws merged at the border and reshaped multiracial alliances into more discrete, segregated race relations. It presents a legal and social history of how the borderlands underwent a sweeping transformation, whereby the “open borders” of the 1880s hardened into much more racially discriminating boundaries – locally, nationally, and internationally – by the 1930s. In the process, as racial ideologies migrated across national boundaries, it became more difficult for racialized bodies to do the same. And as the United States and Mexico each developed more stringent detention, deportation, and exclusion policies based on race, multiracial relations and people were not only made less visible within the national body politic, but were removed from the boundaries of national identity altogether.",1448873255,,Dissertations & Theses," Lim, JulianLimJulianLim, Julian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3119229631 , 81172872 , 66569 , 9781303517396 , 3574738 , 3574738", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303517396, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448873255?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," African American Studies , Black history , Latin American history , American history , Law , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , African-American , Borderlands , Chinese , Immigration , Mexican , Race , United States-Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+%22future+immense%22%3A+Race+and+immigration+in+the+multiracial+U.S.-Mexico+borderlands%2C+1880%E2%80%931936&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lim%2C+Julian&amp;isbn=9781303517396&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Privatizing the Golden Years: Power and Politics in American Pensions, 1935–1990","During the 2008 economic crisis, the private pension system in America lost approximately 26 percent of its value. Those going into retirement that year whose plans were heavily invested in the stock market saw large portions of their savings vanish overnight. The controversies concerning the viability of America's heavily marketized retirement system in a context of global economic insecurity underscores a historical puzzle about how American old-age security came to be so dependent on the market in the first place. In particular, why was the post-New Deal retirement security system set-up as a public-private mix? And why, in the subsequent decades, did the private element become both relatively larger and increasingly subject to market outcomes? Conventional accounts highlight a number of explanatory factors such as union weakness, firm influence and policy feedbacks. Drawing on new archival sources, I reassess these claims by comparing each of the major marketizing episodes of institutional change in the private pension system since World War II: (1) the growth of collectively bargained occupational pensions after the war in conjunction with the stagnation of Social Security replacement rates, (2) the movement of pension fund investments out of the bond market and into the stock market, and (3) the most recent numerical displacement of defined-benefit plans with defined-contribution, 401(k)-type, plans. Through an analysis of each of these episodes, I develop a more satisfactory explanation, which, instead of focusing on identifying causal primacy between interest groups (unions and businesses) and institutions (constitutional constrains and new laws), theorizes the interplay between these forces at a middle-level of abstraction. I term this an interactional approach. The project identifies three interactional processes of interest for studies of institutional change: (1) political institutions mediate interest group influence on welfare institutions, (2) political institutions can shape the strategies interest groups take in regards to welfare policy, and (3) political institutions drive changes in welfare policies relative to the balance of power between interest groups. Together, these processes help account for the development of America's retirement security system since the New Deal.",1468937374,,Dissertations & Theses," McCarthy, Michael A.McCarthyA.MichaelMcCarthy, Michael A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3159800551 , 82450892 , 66569 , 9781303559327 , 3602696 , 3602696", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303559327, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468937374?accountid=14496," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0351 Gerontology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Gerontology , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Firms , Pensions , Political institutions , Retirement , Unions , Welfare state",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privatizing+the+Golden+Years%3A++Power+and+Politics+in+American+Pensions%2C+1935%E2%80%931990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCarthy%2C+Michael+A.&amp;isbn=9781303559327&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Black families' pedagogies: Pedagogical philosophies and practices surrounding black parents' decisions to homeschool,"Current cultural and educational practices and policies in schools are often oppressive and isolating for marginalized populations, groups on the margins of power, and those excluded from the mainstream (Campbell and Kean, 2006). This research explores Black family pedagogies surrounding the decision to homeschool their k-12 children. A central tenet of my research is that race and perceptions about race still heavily influence experiences in school. As a response to these race related concerns in the public school systems, Black parents are choosing not to enroll their children in traditional schools. This work is a small piece of a much larger picture, but I hope that it will help in the project of understanding the influences of race and culture on educational achievement. The intended outcome of this research is to help educators better understand homeschooling as a social movement, provide a framework for reaching the increasingly diverse needs of the students in their classrooms, and identify pedagogical practices that produce widespread higher student achievement. My research attempts to answer the question: what are the pedagogical philosophies Black parents identify as their reasons for homeschooling? The following sub-questions guided my theoretical analysis: 1) to what extent do African American homeschooling parents transform the relationship of race and power constructed by their racialized backgrounds in their teaching philosophies and pedagogies? 2) To what extent do these parents live according to or in resistance to an ideology espoused by a racialized society? 3) Have these parents chosen homeschooling as racial protectionism? I used a critical race theoretical framework. Each participant in this study has had a unique experience, but collectively the narratives provide a window for understanding the pedagogical philosophies of African American homeschool parents. Commonalities found were the desire to provide culturally relevant teaching, and a desire to shield children from overt and covert racism so prevalent in schools. The pedagogy these families operate within is one of reform.

While never formally at war with a seemingly democratic political system post 1981 presidential elections, the life of the broader Honduran population was very much impacted by the 1970s and 1980s Central American conflicts. The people's experiences show a reality very similar to that of a country at war. However, very little is known about the internal political and social effects the wars had on the Honduran population, and popular perceptions of this period are absent from scholarly works. Scholarly work has so far largely ignored this aspect of Honduran history, and has based historical accounts solely on facts and events officially documented by the media and governments. This not only leaves Honduran history incomplete, but it also obviates the implications of the Central American conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s on today's political landscape, and leaves room for misinterpretations of current political events by the international community. The common stories of the Honduran citizens who lived during the Central American conflicts are an integral part of the country's national identity today and need to be incorporated into the larger hegemonic national narrative. This untold story will contribute to placing Honduras in a larger and balanced Central American historical account by adding another important chapter on contemporary Latin America history.",1476211665,,Dissertations & Theses," Robles, Yaser S.RoblesS.YaserRobles, Yaser S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3177107541 , 84523412 , 66569 , 9781303595363 , 3604155 , 3604155", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303595363, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1476211665?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Latin American history , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Armed conflicts , Central America , Cold War , Honduras , Social resistance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=En+el+Aire+Escribieron+la+Historia%3A+Honduras%0A%E2%80%93+a+System+of+Hegemonic+Powers+and+Underlying+Social+Resistance+During+the+Central+American+Conflicts+of+the+1970s+and+1980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robles%2C+Yaser+S.&amp;isbn=9781303595363&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The literature of political conversion (&lt;i&gt;tenkō &lt;/i&gt;) of Japan,"The Literature of Political Conversion ( Tenko ) of Japan This dissertation explores the controversial topic of tenko (""ideological conversion"") of mid-1930s Japan, with focus on the tenko literature, a corpus of literary narratives produced by those who underwent conversion or expressed themselves concretely in response to the pressures towards it. Caused by the state's massive arrests, imprisonment, and other repressive measures, tenko led not only to mass defections from the Japanese Communist Party, but also to an irrevocable change within Japan's modern intellectual history. With a larger view to addressing the often vexed relationship between state authorities and artists and intellectuals, this study conducts a historical and critical examination of the conditions and reception of tenko , as well as of the characteristics of tenko literature, and offers close readings of Nakano Shigeharu's ""Mura no ie"" (House in the Village, 1934) and Sata Ineko's Kurenai (Crimson, 1936). The first half of the dissertation shows how the controversial category of tenko and its literature has been tackled, gesturing to redefine the methodological terms for their study. It first historically maps out the ideological transformations of Japan's Marxist movement from its first manifestations at the end of the 19th century until June 1933, when two key Japanese Communist Party leaders, Sano Manabu and Nabeyama Sadachika, publicly declared their tenko . Through a critical survey of the large body of existing Japanese and English language studies dealing with the tenko phenomenon, the first part shows the ways in which ideological understanding of tenko has affected the reading and interpretation of the tenko literature. The latter half of the dissertation is devoted to a close reading of the texts by Nakano and Sata. In order to carve out new directions for the understanding of both chosen and the tenko narratives at large, my analysis pays attention to the hitherto unnoticed or neglected aspects of ""Mura no ie"" and Kurenai . Thickly informed by the extensive grasp of the contexts of tenko , my intensive re-reading of two of the most representative examples of Japanese tenko literature points to the rich interpretative possibilities residing in those narratives of prewar Japan. The resonances and lessons from Japan's political, intellectual, and literary struggles with the external pressures towards ideological conversion, the dissertation ultimately argues, are far from exhausted by previous scholarship; Japanese tenko literature holds a rich heuristic relevance for contemporary social and political affairs, awaiting new, comparative or global perspectives beyond the previous pale of exclusively Japanese contexts.",1492138292,,Dissertations & Theses," Sipos, George TiberiuSiposTiberiuGeorgeSipos, George Tiberiu", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3193133981 , 82614932 , 66569 , 9781303634741 , 3606354 , 3606354", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303634741, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492138292?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History"," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History"," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History",," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History"," Modern literature , Asian literature , History"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Ideological conversion , Japan , Literature , Nakano shigeharu , Sata ineko , Tenko",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+literature+of+political+conversion+%28tenk%C5%8D+%29+of+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sipos%2C+George+Tiberiu&amp;isbn=9781303634741&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Political Backlash: The Corporate West, the United Farm Workers' Movement, and the Rise of Reaganism in American Politics","Political Backlash uses the strikes and boycotts waged by César Chávez and the United Farm Workers Union (UFW) between 1965 and 1970 to examine a profound shift in party politics and political economy. During this period, the political alliances of the Corporate West swung from center-left to right, underwriting the redirection of the nation's political current from corporate liberalism to the corporate conservatism known as Reaganism. Historians who consider this period one of transition from the New Deal order to the New Right have favored an eastern and urban-industrial focus, overlooking the pivotal role played by the Corporate West. This project addresses that deficiency. It puts the Corporate West—and its economic driver, California agribusiness—at the center of the story, thereby providing a more detailed analysis of this seminal transition in American party politics and political economy. Drawing from research conducted at over two dozen repositories in the United States and Canada, the projected uses a wide range of sources from economic reports and the records of the UFW to the papers of more than a dozen politicians. From this source base, the discussion maps the political-economic connections among California agribusiness, the Corporate West, both political parties, as well as the activism of Chávez and the union. The Corporate West was one of the greatest benefactors of bi-partisan state capitalism throughout the twentieth century, and by the 1960s reigned as a dominant economic force in America. So too did California agriculture, which produced a cornucopia of specialty crops unmatched anywhere in the world. In 1965, the UFW targeted this primary pillar of the Corporate West, as well as its exploitive labor system. With Chávez at the helm, the UFW initiated a wave of unprecedented activism that tapped into the political networks of organized labor, New Left groups, religious organizations, and white middle-to-upper-class housewives. The activism of this diverse coalition ultimately took the form of a national and international boycott against California grapes and their corporate investors, producing one of the sharpest challenges to the region's economic order. Situated at the confluences of race, labor, and industry, the UFW movement also came to represent a contentions political issue—a conflict that often played out publicly between César Chávez and Ronald Reagan. On the ground, the UFW commanded one of the most diverse coalitions in American politics to help advance its movement. In boardrooms, state houses, and Washington D.C., however, the Corporate West—backed by politicians like Reagan—mobilized politically and increased its influence to become a vital player in the changing tide of party politics. Both political parties contracted to the fringes and broke the bi-partisan political balance of the Corporate West, which shifted social reform and labor to one side, and business to the other. Democrats turned away from business to embrace an array of identity politics largely based on UFW supporters, while Republicans similarly moved away from moderate positions to eventually embody the corporate conservatism of Ronald Reagan. Political Backlash is a story of power, charting the political transition from liberal consensus to conservative ascendance, and highlighting the UFW's important and overlooked role in this change. Most importantly, it places western business at the heart, explaining the real fall of the New Deal order and defining more pointedly the political and economic phenomenon known as Reaganism.",1495912947,,Dissertations & Theses," Holmes, Todd EdwardHolmesEdwardToddHolmes, Todd Edward", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3209269141 , 81672882 , 66569 , 9781303714719 , 3578354 , 3578354", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303714719, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1495912947?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Agribusiness , California , Chavez, Cesar , Consecutive ascendance , Farm labor , Reagan, Ronald",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+Backlash%3A++The+Corporate+West%2C+the+United+Farm+Workers%27+Movement%2C+and+the+Rise+of+Reaganism+in+American+Politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holmes%2C+Todd+Edward&amp;isbn=9781303714719&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Design and analysis of location centered large-scale Opportunistic Networks,"With the high penetration of mobile devices and their equipments of wireless interfaces in people's lives, the development of the scenario of Opportunistic Networks(OppNets) has become available. OppNets enable transmissions by exploiting temporary wireless links and connections opportunistically arising from mobility nature of nodes. The applications of OppNets have emerged in a wide range of areas. OppNets have attracted a lot of attention from the wireless and mobile network research community, while little has been paid to the OppNets in large-scale scenario. The existing OppNets are not scaled well to large-scale area due to the high uncertainty embedded in transient contacts among people on the move. This dissertation introduces the large-scale opportunistic network that is centered and linked by populous locations in a physically large network field instead of transient contacts among mobile nodes. The relative stationary of mobile devices within these locations creates stabler and longer contact opportunities compared to those during movement and therefore provides much higher chances for successful message exchanges, potentially larger network capacity, and more flexibility for application design. A two-layer architecture for the location centered large-scale opportunistic network is proposed in this dissertation. The base layer handles connection and enables device discovery and connection establishment within a location. The upper layer deals with routing which delivers messages to targeted locations and nodes. For location targeted routing, two routing schemes, LOcation based routing for OPportunistic networks termed LOOP and GEOcasting for OPPortunistic networks termed Geoopp are proposed. Both adapt geographic greedy routing and fit it in the context of large-scale OppNets. The challenge lies in determining the future locations of nodes. LOOP and Geoopp differ in the determination. LOOP constructs a Bayes' predictive model to explore a node's mobility history and learn its mobility pattern, the regularity embedded in its movement. Instead of complicated data mining in LOOP, Geeopp offers a simple yet efficient way to learn the regularity in a novel approach. Geoopp introduces the concepts of inter-visiting time and contact availability per visiting to characterize a node's mobility. Chebyshev's inequality is employed to capture the regularity embedded in node mobility from visit and contact perspectives. For node targeted routing, a CAlendar based RouTing scheme termed CART is proposed. While most existing routing schemes infer node mobility from context and social information, including LOOP and Geoopp which infer future locations from previous trajectory, CART studies a novel direction to obtain mobility without inference. CART explores the online public calendars for acquiring reliable node mobility and more importantly a global view of the evolving network topology. At the source node, CART can discover a path connecting source node and destination node, a node sequence from source to destination where pair of adjacent nodes share overlapped time and location. The message will be forwarded over the predetermined path. For the connection layer, a device discovery approach and connection establishment scheme using ad-hoc Wi-Fi is proposed in this dissertation. It discovers devices within a larger range compared to commonly used Bluetooth and therefore enables the longer and stabler connections among mobile nodes inside a location. This approach is further enhanced with energy efficiency.",1499923349,,Dissertations & Theses," Lu, ShanshanLuShanshanLu, Shanshan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3223022151 , 80909982 , 66569 , 9781303703683 , 3610535 , 3610535", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303703683, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1499923349?accountid=14496," 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science"," 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science"," 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science",," 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science"," Information Technology , Computer science"," Applied sciences , Mobile devices , Network analysis , Network design , OppNets , Opportunistic Networks , Wireless interfaces",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Design+and+analysis+of+location+centered+large-scale+Opportunistic+Networks&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lu%2C+Shanshan&amp;isbn=9781303703683&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""'Rise up - make haste - our people need us!' : Pan-Indigenous Activism in Canada and the United States, 1950 to 1975","This dissertation examines the period of pan-Indigenous activism in Canada and in the United States between 1950 and 1975. The rights era in both countries presented important challenges for both legislators and for minority groups. In a post-war context increasingly concerned with equality and global justice, minority groups were uniquely positioned to exact from the government perhaps greater concessions than ever before. For Indigenous groups, however, the potential of this period delivered only in part due to initiatives like the Great Society and the Just Society which, while claiming to offer justice for Indigenous people, threatened them as perhaps never before, by homogenizing Indigenous people and their demands with those of other minority groups. As such, I argue that the broader political and social context of the rights era served to inform, but not to dictate, the shape and content of the Indigenous rights movement. The relationship of Indigenous activism to other forms of activism during the rights era was both complicated and contentious, with Indigenous activists conceiving of their struggle in markedly different terms than other marginalized groups. Within this context, I examine the formation of both mainstream and alternative organizations, as well as their responses to the challenges of radicalism, of youth culture and of gender. I argue that the failure of mainstream organizations to properly address the grassroots contributed to a crisis of legitimacy within an increasingly crowded organizational milieu. As both the documentary record and oral accounts demonstrate, what many have demarcated as a new period of “pan-Indian” unity, therefore, was also marked by important division and protest that has often been overlooked in laudatory accounts of the activism of the period. These internal critiques also serve to explain why the mid-1970s signaled an important change in organizational tactics in both countries, at least in the way they had been practiced previously. In addition, the proliferation of rights-seeking groups demonstrated an important echo pattern whereby both policy and protest was replicated and reinvented in a Canadian context slightly later than in an American one.",1512636639,,Dissertations & Theses," Duhamel, Karine R.DuhamelR.KarineDuhamel, Karine R.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3265987891 , 84765062 , 66569 , 9780499280367 , NS28036 , NS28036", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9780499280367, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512636639?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies"," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies"," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies",," 0334 Canadian history , 0740 Native American studies"," Canadian history , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Aboriginal , History",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27Rise+up+-+make+haste+-+our+people+need+us%21%27+%3A+Pan-Indigenous+Activism+in+Canada+and+the+United+States%2C+1950+to+1975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Duhamel%2C+Karine+R.&amp;isbn=9780499280367&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rethinking the spectacle: Radical political agency in the information society,"This work critically examines the tension between the theoretical concept of ""spectacle"" and political agency in the theory and practice of the Situationist International (SI) in order to assess the potential that new communications technology provides for left-wing organizations and social movements. Combining the ideas of Guy Debord and other SI members with those of Mikhail Bakhtin and Hannah Arendt, it argues that neither sleek public relations strategies nor grand, awe-inspiring displays should be used as substitutes for democratic dialogue. Spectacles should not be used to foster fleeting agreements on particular issues; rather, what is necessary is to use them to develop public spaces for ongoing agreements and disagreements. For this to occur, a radical spectacle must be conceived in much wider terms, as involving not just the images and messages themselves, but also the processes in which they are produced and the contexts in which they are received. Chapter 1 begins with Debord's renowned theorization of the spectacle, while chapter 2 examines the practical implications of this conception of the spectacle for the organization Debord co-founded, the SI. With the first two chapters highlighting Debord's problematic assumption of audience passivity and the SI's highly exclusionary organizational form, chapters 3 and 4 proceed to develop a framework for thinking about how spectacles could be made consistent with a radical conception of democracy. Although Debord is not generally considered a radical democratic thinker, chapter 3 argues that there are tendencies in his thought that lead in this direction, including his notions of the situation, dérive, détournement, and play. The last of these, the concept of play, is especially important, providing the underlying political ethos for the situation and all of Debord's other practical concepts. Chapter 4 uses Bakhtin's dialogism and Arendt's conception of politics to further establish a foundation on which to ground the playful tendencies of Debord and the Situationists. Taken together, these theoretical contributions offer a number of insights on what a radical spectacle might look like, ideas that are presented in chapter 5 in the context of an engagement with public relations theory.",1517416869,,Dissertations & Theses," Penner, DevinPennerDevinPenner, Devin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3278652401 , 86429352 , 66569 , 9780499001870 , NS00187 , NS00187", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9780499001870, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1517416869?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications",," 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," Political science , Mass communications"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rethinking+the+spectacle%3A%0ARadical+political+agency+in+the+information+society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Penner%2C+Devin&amp;isbn=9780499001870&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The socially real edge of modernism: political agency in british literature 1914-1939,"This study considers marginal modernist writers’ negotiations of counter-currents in political thought, especially in terms of literary and political strikes, moments at which the minor collective consolidates. Their theories of what democracy might mean to the twentieth century can be seen as important in a reinterpretation of the moment of modernism. The writers explored are neither reactionary nor apathetic, but imbricated in a cultural nexus that incorporates mainstream and radical currents, and that cannot be delineated by national or international categories. Their figuration of collectives and their fashioning of political agency are particularly relevant to considerations of the individual artist-intellectual and the engaged political activist, and the poems, plays and other discursive writings explored here respond to issues of commitment and the radical form in which that commitment might be expressed.    By focusing on close readings of British poetry (and other discursive forms) written in the period 1914-1939, I read minor modernist literature’s socially real content as being expressive of a modernist dialectic which takes experimental literary form as a technique to represent the contradictions of modern society. Each chapter is historically embedded in the context of the work, taking the form of four case studies analysing the flashpoints in the history of the inter-war period. These chapters centre on writers who could be considered as part of a minor Anglo-American modernist continuum, who are set in dialogue with the European avant-garde. Chapter one focuses on John Rodker and Mary Butts, writing in the context of pacifist debates and the state of exception during the First World War. Chapter two, on Mina Loy, considers her manifesto style in relation to post-war constructions of democracy, particularly in its implications for poetic subjectivity. Chapter three, on Hugh MacDiarmid and Edgell Rickword, isolates the General Strike of 1926 as a high-point of British historical radicalism, yet to be considered as a major topic of British literary engagements. The British Surrealist movement of the 1930s constitutes the focus of chapter four, with writers such as Charles Madge, Humphrey Jennings and David Gascoyne central to an analysis of representational poetic strategies in terms of their access to and influence on political and social reality. My conclusion is a kind of coda to the concepts of social realism latent in much of this work, bringing the study into the contemporary by way of an analysis of experimental form and the socially real in contemporary poetry of the British Poetry Revival, considering work by Andrew Crozier, Roy Fisher and Barry MacSweeney.",1534975871,,Dissertations & Theses," Menmuir, AlasdairMenmuirAlasdairMenmuir, Alasdair", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331691301 , 86588022 , 101309 , U608517 , U608517 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/4642/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1534975871?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/4642/ , (UMI)AAIU608517 , Language, literature and linguistics , Britain",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+socially+real+edge+of+modernism%3A+political+agency+in+british+literature+1914-1939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Menmuir%2C+Alasdair&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Spatial mobility and labour markets,"This thesis brings together selected published works on the theme of spatial mobility and labour markets. The works selected adopt a range of methodological approaches, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. They are grouped into four inter-related subthemes: (1) labour migration and labour market adjustment; (2) mobilities, migration and commuting; (3) spatial (im)mobility, place and social networks; and (4) immigration, integration and labour market issues. These sub-themes span responses to changes in employment and non-employment, the continuum of labour market-related movements from daily and weekly commuting to employment-related migration, spatial mobility and immobility, and internal and international migration. Taken together, the works presented provide an original contribution to knowledge on spatial mobility and labour markets. They also inform key policy debates. Particular contributions include: (1) evidence on spatial and temporal variations in labour migration as an adjustment mechanism within the broader context of changing labour markets; (2) empirical and theoretical insights into the location and mobility strategies of dual career households and how some individuals might substitute commuting for migration for individual and household gains; (3) evidence on the importance of area perceptions and place-based social networks in constraining spatial mobility – particularly for some individuals in some places; and (4) policy-relevant evidence on the impact of international migration on regional and local labour markets and implications for local skills strategies and local action on integration of new arrivals. Together the works highlight the reality of the fuzziness of the binary measurement categories conventionally used in analyses of spatial mobility and indicate the need for greater flexibility. They also demonstrate the need for increased sensitivity to the diversity of individual, household and local labour market experiences in different times and places.",1535022052,,Dissertations & Theses," Green, Anne E.GreenE.AnneGreen, Anne E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331811321 , 88334552 , 101309 , U609380 , U609380 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57300/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535022052?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57300/ , (UMI)AAIU609380 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spatial+mobility+and+labour+markets&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Green%2C+Anne+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Resistance and the re-appropriation of the warrior trope in mapuche cultural production,"My thesis 'Resistance and the Re-appropriation of the Warrior Trope in Mapuche Cultural Production,' traces how the Mapuche warrior has entered western literary tradition through 16th century texts, and was appropriated by the Chilean state at key moments in the nation's history, and how this trope has subsequently been reclaimed by Mapuche poets. I examine the form of this re-appropriation moves from the 'spiritual' warrior of the past who comes to 'save' the Mapuche of the present, to the physical 'taking on' of the warrior role in art from anti-poetry to hip-hop, to the abandonment of what is perceived by many weichafe ('the person who does war') to be a romantic symbol best confined to the literary realm.

The specters of Curtis and Cobain grow, mutate and are re-invented with each YouTube view, each video link passed and pasted, each blog written and commented upon in what amounts to a global community connected by the invisible tethers of the world wide web. The ease and speed of communication via the Internet's social networking sites allows for the continued evolution of the myths that surround the singers, granting them qualities in death they never possessed in life. The reality of what these cult heroes accomplished seems to be washed away in a tsunami of branding, consumer goods and annual tributes. This marketed, copyrighted, corporatized version of memory is sold back to consumers just as the 'real' underpins Factory Records chief Tony Wilson famously saying, 'Fiction is better than fact'. This ‘fiction’ has bloomed, blossomed and continued to play a role on the pop and cultural landscape thirty years after the singers physical demise. Joy Devotion explores the mediated nostalgia created in the wake of their passing and the cultural materialism key to the propulsion of global faux shared memory. Utilizing the framework of Siegfried Kracauer’s essays “The Mass Ornament” and “Photography,” Joy Devotion analyzes this fabricated past, specifically disassembling the assumed perception created by widely available images. Kracauer uses the Mancunian dance troupe the Tiller Girls to illustrate the process of blurring, and often erasing, individuality and criticality in the haze of mediated consumption and meaning. Within this context, Joy Devotion illustrates how such production, procreation and currency of icon has historical foundations across a diverse array of fundamental belief systems, including even the most sacred texts. By dissecting the means by which the stories of saints are recorded through hagiography, parallels between the evolution of religious myths dovetail closely with the symbolization applied to specific cult figures, thus allowing Curtis and Cobain to act as hallowed archetypes in the ever-increasingly secular world. Worship of the singers comes by bowing to the grinding wheels of capitalism, purchasing items featuring their youthful countenances and band logos or by taking sonic pilgrimages to areas associated with the artists, either in real time or as an on-line voyeur. Each journey, whether perpetuated by the click of a mouse on a computer or through retracing of footsteps taken by an idol, transform these places to a sacred space, mecca for fans, believers, in a world dependent on the world wide web. To further investigate the behavior at such sites of worship, this work includes a practical aspect. For one year, pictures were taken on the same day on a monthly basis at the Ian Curtis Memorial Stone. The trinkets, tributes and trash on the Stone is in constant flux, reflecting the ever-migrating myth of the vocalist himself- a harsh and glaring contrast to the finality of death. Joy Devotion captures for the first time a year in the life of the rock shrine- existing almost as a destination unto itself. With each visitor, identity, ‘memory’, meaning and the legacy of Curtis and Joy Division changes and flows- similar to the seasons rotating, and the movement in the landscape of the cemetery itself. Similarly, a visit to Seattle coinciding with the 17th anniversary of the Kurt Cobain’s death illustrates an ever-growing disparity between the rupture of perceived importance as perpetuated in the 2.0 world, and real-time activities occurring in physical space.",1654748110,,Dissertations & Theses," Otter, JenniferOtterJenniferOtter, Jennifer", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3588364101 , 93840892 , 101309 , U621166 , U621166 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/9462/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1654748110?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," http://research.gold.ac.uk/9462/ , (UMI)AAIU621166 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Joy+devotion%3A+adventures+in+image+and+authenticity+through+the+lens+of+kurt+cobain+and+ian+curtis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Otter%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Supporting 'community' in an era of global mental health: a case study of an hiv-affected south african community,"How may the mental health of socially deprived HIV/AIDS affected communities be supported in an era of ‘global mental health’? To date, ‘community’ efforts have been informed by a largely biomedical and epidemiological body of evidence, distracting attention from lived realities, local contexts and their abilities to frame understandings of mental distress and treatment. This thesis seeks to contribute a productive critique of the Global Mental Health field, by expanding on some of the missing dimensions in their conceptualisations of health and healing. Through a focus on social psychological processes of community, knowledge and social change, it formulates a series of suggestions for how the Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) and other policy actors can build on their existing efforts, through establish health enabling contexts where communities actively participate in addressing mental distress, and tackling the contexts that constitute distress in locally relevant ways. The thesis reports on a case study of KwaNagase (Manguzi), an HIV-affected rural community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It takes interest in the intersection of three respective groups, exploring how they understand, cope with, and work together in efforts to support mental well-being: 1) poor HIV/AIDS affected women experiencing mental distress; 2) community level supports (local NGOs and traditional healers); and 3) public health services (primary health sector). Data was collected over a three month period using multiple methods. In-depth individual interviews (n = 43) were triangulated by a motivated ethnography (Duveen and Lloyd, 1999) that explored local cultural, structural and symbolic contexts of community that frame understandings of mental health and delivery of care. Grounded thematic analyses identified that women’s understandings of mental distress were shaped by experiences of poverty, violence and HIV, which in turn, limited their ability to meet normative expectations linked to gender roles of ‘mother’ and ‘wife’. Indigenous psychosocial coping strategies employed by women to tackle the aforementioned drivers of distress were underpinned by the presence or absence of social psychological resources that optimise health and well-being: agency, partnerships, critical thinking and solidarity. Primary mental health care actors’ (NGOs and formal health service actors) understandings of women’s distress were informed by an awareness of the structural and symbolic issues facing women in everyday life, aligning with the women’s own understandings. Their best practices highlighted efforts to establish receptive social spaces – a critical dimension of health enabling contexts but were limited by symbolic and structural barriers such as stigma among providers, and general under-resourcing of the sector. To overcome the limits facing community mental health services in Manguzi and similar contexts, the thesis concludes by highlighting a series of suggested actions to bolster identified community mental health competencies, and provides a tool kit of recommended strategies to support existing public sector efforts to promote mentally healthy communities.",1687700787,,Dissertations & Theses," Burgess, Rochelle AnnBurgessAnnRochelleBurgess, Rochelle Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713040181 , 96796752 , 101309 , U639889 , U639889 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/808/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687700787?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0573 Public health , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0573 Public health , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0573 Public health , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Public health , South African Studies , Social structure"," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/808/ , (UMI)AAIU639889 , Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Supporting+%27community%27+in+an+era+of+global+mental+health%3A+a+case+study+of+an+hiv-affected+south+african+community&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burgess%2C+Rochelle+Ann&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The politics of climate change in the caribbean: a sociological investigation into policy responses, public engagement and activism","Debate abounds over whether or not the lack of adequate political action on climate change can be explained by reference to a ‘post-democratic’ and ‘postpolitical’ consensus. While there has been scholarship that looks at neoliberalism and environmental concerns in the Caribbean, a region commonly represented as being particularly vulnerable to climate change, there is little that explores responses to climate change there sociologically, and in terms of debate around the post-political consensus. This thesis, therefore, constitutes an ethnographic investigation into the politics of responses to climate change, concentrating on representations of public engagement, activism and policy responses, in three case-study sites in different contexts, all relevant to the Caribbean region as a whole. These are: 1) the regional context, focusing on climate change policies and responses in the Caribbean; 2) the international context, exploring policy-making, public engagement and social movement activism at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 16th Conference of Parties in Cancún, Mexico; and 3) the national context, examining the relationships between community engagement around conservation, development and the governance of protected areas, and climate change in Belize. The contributions of the thesis are as follows. Firstly the research details the specific dynamics of tendencies towards neoliberal development, and hence depoliticisation, in responses to climate change in each of the case-study contexts. Nevertheless, the theory of the post-political is elaborated on where it is shown that these tendencies can be better understood with reference to the legacies of colonialism in the region, and the forms of development established and enforced in their wake. Hence, secondly, the research considers depoliticisation processes in the post-colonial contexts of the Caribbean, indicating that pressures towards neoliberal development shape responses to climate change there. Thirdly, the study adds texture to existing discussions by moving beyond overly monolithic theoretical accounts of post-politics, via a nuanced engagement with ethnographic data, to highlight the ambivalent dimensions of people’s accounts, and the pragmatic actions they take in response. An evaluation of the latter reveals challenges to tendencies towards depoliticisation, as well as some of the tensions involved in trying to implement depoliticized responses. Finally, I demonstrate that different responses toclimate change imply contrasting models of society, and human action. The data points towards there being an affinity between post-political and individualised, or ‘unsociological’ accounts of climate change.",1687709166,,Dissertations & Theses," Sealey-Higgins, Leon AyoSealey-HigginsAyoLeonSealey-Higgins, Leon Ayo", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713035911 , 96794782 , 101309 , U639712 , U639712 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6499/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687709166?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0474 Environmental management , 0615 Political science"," 0404 Climate Change , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0474 Environmental management , 0615 Political science"," 0404 Climate Change , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0474 Environmental management , 0615 Political science", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0404 Climate Change , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0474 Environmental management , 0615 Political science"," Climate Change , Caribbean Studies , Environmental management , Political science"," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6499/ , (UMI)AAIU639712 , Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Earth sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+climate+change+in+the+caribbean%3A+a+sociological+investigation+into+policy+responses%2C+public+engagement+and+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sealey-Higgins%2C+Leon+Ayo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Even flow: water privatization and the mobilization of power in the philippines,"This thesis investigates the politics of privatization and contentious collective action in the water sector in the Philippines. It examines the complex interplay of diverse forces in the everyday politics of water in Metropolitan Manila with a particular emphasis on organized urban poor communities and non-governmental organizations. The thesis illustrates how these groups engage with regulatory agencies, multilateral institutions, transnational corporations, informal water venders, and local machine politicians to play key roles in shaping the regulation of water provision in the developing world. Thus, to understand the material realities and lived experiences of the urban poor in cities like Metro Manila, close attention must be paid to patterns of contestation, competition, and collaboration among a diverse array of actors, across local, national, and international levels of analysis. Using Karl Polanyi’s insights on the socio-political consequences of market extension as a point of departure, I show that although water privatization and social resistance can be understood in terms of a ‘double movement’, Polanyi’s framework is insufficient for more detailed analysis. Hence, I develop new analytical tools to examine the nature of water privatization-related mobilization in the Philippines. Examining the micro-politics of the urban poor in their collective action for water at the local level, I argue that privatization has engendered countervailing power in the water sector that is neither fully transgressive nor completely contained, and steeped in local and historical legacies of radical resistance in the Philippines. At the policy level, I show how NGOs and local community groups undertake what I term “regulatory mobilization” to influence the new rules of the service delivery game, as well as to deliver much- needed basic services to urban poor communities. Depending on how local and sectoral politics are conflated, such regulatory mobilization may sometimes not only result in obtaining subsistence goods, but may also occasionally project countervailing power in the policy sector, and influence formal regulatory frameworks in surprising ways.",1687710921,,Dissertations & Theses," Chng, Nai RuiChngRuiNaiChng, Nai Rui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713040081 , 96796692 , 101309 , U639891 , U639891 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/810/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687710921?accountid=14496," 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0617 Public administration"," 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0617 Public administration"," 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0617 Public administration", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0561 Pacific Rim Studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0617 Public administration"," Pacific Rim Studies , Water Resource Management , Public administration"," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/810/ , (UMI)AAIU639891 , Social sciences , Earth sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Even+flow%3A+water+privatization+and+the+mobilization+of+power+in+the+philippines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chng%2C+Nai+Rui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Advancing transformative justice?: a case study of a trade union, social movement and ngo network in south africa","Transitional justice mechanisms have largely focused upon individual violations of a narrow set of civil and political rights and the provision of legal and quasi-legal remedies, typically truth commissions, amnesties and prosecutions. In contrast, this thesis highlights the significance of structural violence in producing and reproducing violations of socio-economic rights. The thesis argues that there is a need to utilise a different toolkit, and a different understanding of human rights, to that typically employed in transitional justice in order to remedy structural violations of human rights such as these. A critique of the scope of existing models of transitional justice is put forward and the thesis sets out a definition of transformative justice as expanding upon and providing an alternative to the transitional justice mechanisms typically employed in post-conflict and post-authoritarian contexts. Focusing on a case study of a network of social movements, nongovernmental organisations and trade unions working on land and housing rights in South Africa, the thesis asks whether networks of this kind can advance transformative justice. In answering this question the thesis draws upon the idea of political responsibility as a means of analysing and assessing network action. The existing literature on political responsibilities and transnational advocacy networks is interrogated and adapted to the largely domestic case study network. Based on empirical research on the case study network and an analysis of its political responsibilities the thesis finds that networks of this kind can contribute to transformative justice. They do this by providing space in which affected communities articulate their concerns over socio-economic rights issues. Providing a means by which existing structures and practices may be contested contributes to processes of transformative justice. However, based on the case study it is not certain that network action of this kind will necessarily lead to transformative outcomes.",1687711512,,Dissertations & Theses," Evans, MatthewEvansMatthewEvans, Matthew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713041331 , 96797342 , 101309 , U639638 , U639638 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5715/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687711512?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy , 0654 South African Studies , 0700 Social structure"," Labor relations , Public policy , South African Studies , Social structure"," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5715/ , (UMI)AAIU639638 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Advancing+transformative+justice%3F%3A+a+case+study+of+a+trade+union%2C+social+movement+and+ngo+network+in+south+africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Evans%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The diaspora of cypriot antiquities and the british museum, 1860-1900","This thesis examines the invention of Cyprus’ ancient history through the diaspora of Cypriot antiquities in the latter half of nineteenth century and the role of the modern museum in it (1860-1900). It maps the movement of the objects from their excavation sites, to their circulation in metropolitan museums and, finally to their display in museum galleries. In doing so this thesis explores the emergence of archaeology as a field-based discipline in the broader colonial, imperial and geopolitical context. The research of this project was conducted mainly at the Cyprus State Archives, the Greek and Roman Departmental Archives (British Museum), Dartmouth College Archives (NH). The first part of the thesis provides the theoretical framework in which this research is situated. Chapter 1 introduces the project, its research questions, its research questions and outcomes. Chapter 2 discusses the literature providing the main concepts that formed the arguments of this thesis. Chapter 3 contextualizes the diaspora of Cypriot antiquities within the broader history of archaeology and Chapter 4 overviews the methodology followed and the archival sources that were used for this project. The second part consists of my empirical work and maps the diaspora of the antiquities. It is thematically divided in three chapters. Chapter 5, Law, looks at the colonial and legal context of the excavation and exportation of the objects. Chapter 6, Excavation, discusses the every-day conduct of Cypriot archaeology in the field. Chapter 7, Circulation, examines the practices of collecting Cypriot antiquities, their exportation and circulation in metropolitan museums, and their display in museums (particularly in the British Museum). Chapter 8 brings the thesis into a conclusion and highlights the main findings and arguments of this project. The thesis explores the production, circulation and display of scientific knowledge regarding the ancient past of Cyprus by following the antiquities in their various forms (texts, impressions, photographs, objects). By following the objects’ social lives it addresses the issues of the circulation of scientific knowledge, of the criteria for asserting its authenticity and credibility and of the local/global nature of archaeological science. It will demonstrate that the methodological tenor of writing the objects’ biographies links the different scales of science’s making and illuminates its hidden stories, such as the practicalities of collecting in the field.",1689622862,,Dissertations & Theses," Nikolaou, PolinaNikolaouPolinaNikolaou, Polina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3718851871 , 93839782 , 101309 , U640574 , U640574 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/14988", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689622862?accountid=14496," 0324 Archaeology , 0730 Museum studies"," 0324 Archaeology , 0730 Museum studies"," 0324 Archaeology , 0730 Museum studies", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0324 Archaeology , 0730 Museum studies"," Archaeology , Museum studies"," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/14988 , (UMI)AAIU640574 , Social sciences , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+diaspora+of+cypriot+antiquities+and+the+british+museum%2C+1860-1900&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nikolaou%2C+Polina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Essays on Externalities and Agriculture in the United States and Brazil,"Chapter 1: Economic Factors Affecting Diversified Farming Systems. In response to a shift toward specialization and mechanization during the 20th century, there has been momentum on the part of a vocal contingent of consumers, producers, researchers, and policy makers who call for a transition toward a new model of agriculture. This model employs fewer synthetic inputs, incorporates practices which enhance biodiversity and environmental services at local, regional, and global scales, and takes into account the social implications of production practices, market dynamics, and product mixes. Within this vision, diversified farming systems (DFS) have emerged as a model that incorporates functional biodiversity at multiple temporal and spatial scales to maintain ecosystem services critical to agricultural production. This essay’s aim is to provide an economists’ perspective on the factors which make diversified farming systems economically attractive, or not-so-attractive, to farmers, and to discuss the potential for and roadblocks to widespread adoption. The essay focuses on how a range of existing and emerging factors drive profitability and adoption of DFS, and suggests that, in order for DFS to thrive, a number of structural changes are needed. These include: 1) public and private investment in the development of low-cost, practical technologies that reduce the costs of production in DFS, 2) support for and coordination of evolving markets for ecosystem services and products from DFS and 3) the elimination of subsidies and crop insurance programs that perpetuate the unsustainable production of staple crops. This work suggests that subsidies and funding be directed, instead, toward points 1) and 2), as well as toward incentives for consumption of nutritious food. Chapter 2: Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon released approximately 5.7 billion tons of CO 2 to the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010, and 50–80% of this deforestation was for pasture. Most assume that increasing demand for cattle products produced in Brazil caused this deforestation, but the empirical work to-date on cattle documents only correlations between cattle herd size, pasture expansion, cattle prices, and deforestation. This essay uses panel data on deforestation and Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) status—an exogenous demand shifter—to estimate whether changes in FMD status caused new deforestation in municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon and cerrado biomes during the 2000–2010 period. Becoming certified as FMD-free caused annual deforestation to be 42% to 85% higher than deforestation rates in infected municipalities, on average, during the 2000–2010 period. Chapter 3: Potential for heterogeneity in the returns to sub-therapeutic antibiotics in U.S. pork and poultry operations. Each year, more than 50,000 people in the U.S. die from hospital-acquired bacterial infections, millions experience episodes of foodborne illness, and reported cases of “superbugs” such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are on the rise. For those who acquire a resistant infection, resistance is associated with a longer duration of treatment, the use of more potent antibiotics, and longer hospital stays. This, in turn, means increased health care costs and costs to society due to antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance is contributing to the scope and severity of this health care crisis, and at least some of the responsibility for antibiotic resistance sits on the shoulders of industrial livestock production. In livestock operations, low or sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics (STAs) are used to promote growth, in addition to their use to prevent and control disease. Today, more antibiotics are used in livestock production and the production of milk and eggs than in humans. While the use of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics is regulated less stringently in the United States than in the European Union, there is movement toward such regulation. Beginning in the 1970s, economic researchers began to study the potential impacts of bans on the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotics on the pork, poultry, and beef sectors and on U.S. consumers, but there has been little study of how heterogeneity impacts antibiotic use, and in turn, how it impacts returns to using antibiotics in U.S. livestock operations. I concentrate on U.S. pork and poultry operations since they are the largest users of sub-therapeutic antibiotics by volume in the U.S., and explore the existing literature on the economics of sub-therapeutic antibiotic use for glimpses of heterogeneity in the returns to antibiotic use. Perhaps the most interesting source of heterogeneity in returns to antibiotic use may be heterogeneity in management and/or the use of potential substitutes for antibiotics, such as improved sanitation practices and more modern facilities. Productivity and use of technologies that substitute for STA use vary amongst producers, and likely by region and farm size. Thus, the marginal abatement costs of reducing STA use vary across industries, producers, production systems, and regions.

The thesis addresses three research questions: What do transnational networks look like on the ground; what do (dis)connections look like and what do they mean in terms of idea circulation, inclusion and exclusion; and (how) do transnational networks operate to include and circulate the ideas of more marginalised groups in society? This thesis presents results from a survey of the work of 281 conservation NGOs in sub-Saharan Africa, which maps out the institutional context of mountain gorilla conservation and raises questions about the interactions, equality and inclusiveness of the sector. Having identified mountain gorilla conservation as a suitable case study for this research, the thesis explores the political and environmental history of the Virungas, looking at how the two interact and influence (dis)connections. Using data gathered from semi-structured interviews, this thesis introduces the key actors, structures and processes involved in mountain gorilla conservation in Rwanda and the DRC and explores the connections between them. It shows how connections based on perceptions of expertise, staff movement and the professional and social circles people move in cause certain ideas to be respected and circulated, whilst other people and their ideas are ‘accidentally’ excluded. At the same time ‘strategic’ disconnections, which result from personal and organisational conflicts, can prevent idea circulation and lead to project duplication in some areas and a lack of projects in others. The thesis also examines NGO and state claims that ‘the idea (for interventions) came from the community’. It argues that, with exceptions, in a context of ‘sensitisation’ of communities to conservation and a complex political history, NGOs and states often define community ‘ideas’ themselves and do not typically have processes in place to foster local ideas, potentially excluding some of the more marginalised groups in society.",1774245282,,Dissertations & Theses," Scholfield, Katherine AbigailScholfieldAbigailKatherineScholfield, Katherine Abigail", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989323421 , 102698442 , 101309 , 10033542 , 10033542 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:212291", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774245282?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:212291 , (UMI)AAI10033542 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+%28dis%29connections%3A+mountain+gorilla+conservation+in+rwanda+and+the+drc&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Scholfield%2C+Katherine+Abigail&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Negotiating the occupational landscape: the career trajectories of ex-teachers and ex-engineers in singapore,"The central focus of this thesis is how professionals in Singapore negotiate occupational mobility in their career life-course. The research seeks to understand the factors that underpin and guide individual aspiration and motivations when making occupational moves within career trajectories. Occupational mobility is fast becoming the norm among the international skilled labour force, creating a need to understand how such flexibility can be used advantageously, at the national level, for workforce management. The approach taken in this study conceptualises the career landscape as a field, and analyses mobility at the political, social and individual levels. It examines the power that is enacted by government on its citizens and the reflexive meaning making of individuals participating in occupational mobility. The empirical work consists of interviews with ex-teachers and ex-engineers in Singapore. The thesis presents an analysis of their narratives and identifies generic skills acquired in pre-employment training and in employment as a key to understanding how professional individuals are negotiating occupational fields. Amongst the achievements of the research is the understanding of what happens when individuals move from one occupation to the next. The research attempts to humanise the 'human resource' and present, through individual narratives, the individual's perspective on the changing nature of work, the need to participate in boundaryless work contexts and their involvement in occupational mobility. The thesis further illustrates the complexities that surround mobile behaviours of workers within an Asian context, and presents ways of understanding the needs of such professional workers so that they can negotiate the contemporary advanced economy landscape more effectively. The resulting conceptual framework attempts to explain how mobile Asian professional workers negotiate occupational mobility within a context that is influenced by conservative Confucian ideologies that place nation before self, and community before family. The research further emphasises the role that state-initiated lifelong learning structures play in creating the mobile worker and explores how generic skills facilitate occupational movements. It discusses the importance of contextualised skill acquisition and practice for subsequent recontextualisation in a new occupation and also aligns current career discourses to the perceptions that these individuals have of their occupations. Finally, the role that lifelong learning is perceived to play when considering the need for career adaptability competences, the space for recontextualisation of skills and the ideologies that influence individual occupational mobility are presented. By looking at those who have participated in it themselves, this research explores how individuals engage in occupational mobility and explains how control can be maintained over people's personal aspirations in the grand occupational mobility scheme.",1774245440,,Dissertations & Theses," Tan, JoyceTanJoyceTan, Joyce", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989335411 , 102698572 , 101309 , 10022042 , 10022042 , http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/20757/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774245440?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/20757/ , (UMI)AAI10022042 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Negotiating+the+occupational+landscape%3A+the+career+trajectories+of+ex-teachers+and+ex-engineers+in+singapore&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tan%2C+Joyce&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Hybrid agency: postmodern contemporary art from oaxaca, mexico","The last three decades have seen the Southern Mexican city of Oaxaca evolve to become an autonomous centre for the creation and promotion of contemporary art on state, national and international levels. The present research's original contribution to knowledge is the analytical investigation of an art movement's response to the political and technological effects characteristic of postmodernity and effected through globalisation. The research uses a hybrid theoretical framework that includes the work of: Fredric Jameson to discuss postmodernism; Nelly Richard to characterise a postmodern Latin America; Homi K. Bhabha to analyse the postcolonial context and the creation of agency; and, inherent to this structure and the context, the work of Néstor García Canclini. The theoretical investigation is supported by ethnography that ascertains how hybrid political thought and community altruism characterise the Oaxacan art community and the aesthetic expression practised by a new generation of its members. Oaxacan contemporary art is based on the success of the post-Rupture primitivist magical realism practised originally by important Oaxacan artists living and travelling in other locations. The most recent generation of contemporary artists in Oaxaca integrates with, upholds and promotes the model of cultural production that is now inextricably intertwined with the local and wider communities. Participant observation and the analysis of the behaviour of the artists studied, focused the investigation on the efficient interaction between artists and collective action as an integrated sector of civil society. The research determines how the artists studied and the wider Oaxacan art community applies their knowledge of global communications and information technology to create and market a cultural product and promote a postmodern social and political perspective. Regarded as a solid sector of the local and regional community due to its national and international standing, the Oaxacan art community constructs political power from significant, direct involvement with micro-projects to engaging in partnerships with state and federal stakeholders in large-scale cultural endeavours. The research discusses projects instigated and undertaken by the artists studied, including the call for a pacifistic solution to the Oaxaca Conflict of 2006, a six-month socio-political uprising caused by actual and historic conditions in the national and regional Left-Right political duel. The strength of the art community is founded on necessary and reinforcing collective action in both artistic and altruistic projects; often combined through the direct use of art in the creation of funds and media-empowered support towards achieving a perceived common good that centres on the protection of identity and the political defence of diversity.",1774246430,,Dissertations & Theses," Pyatt, NeilPyattNeilPyatt, Neil", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989326181 , 102698502 , 101309 , 10024689 , 10024689 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/13818", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774246430?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/13818 , (UMI)AAI10024689 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hybrid+agency%3A+postmodern+contemporary+art+from+oaxaca%2C+mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pyatt%2C+Neil&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Voicing the stories of the excluded: albanian families' history and heritage making at the crossroads of new and old homes,"My research explores the dialectical relationship between identity and the conceptualisation/creation of history and heritage in migration by studying a socially excluded group in Greece, that of Albanian families. Even though the Albanian community has more than twenty years of presence in the country, its stories, often invested with otherness, remain hidden in the Greek ‘mono-cultural’ landscape. In opposition to these stigmatising discourses, my study draws on movements democratising the past and calling for engagements from below by endorsing the socially constructed nature of identity and the denationalisation of memory. A nine-month fieldwork with five Albanian families took place in their domestic and neighbourhood settings in the areas of Athens and Piraeus. Based on critical ethnography, data collection was derived from participant observation, conversational interviews and participatory techniques. From an individual and family group point of view the notion of habitus led to diverse conceptions of ethnic identity, taking transnational dimensions in families’ literal and metaphorical back-and-forth movements between Greece and Albania. Jiggling between the personal and the national, history making reproduced in intergenerational narratives, to fulfil individuals’ identity requirements and shifting ideologies of the present. The creation of heritage through domestic artefacts and embodied practices, revealed identity continuities and ruptures in the diasporic realm, where the remembrance of home away from ‘home’ did not imply the uncritical endorsement of its heritage. My study concludes by underpinning the salience of the personal subject developing a reciprocal relationship with the social, the cultural and the ethnic in constructing identity, history and heritage. Different personal experiences and sociocultural backgrounds lead to different narratives of negotiating identity, history and heritage meaning, explaining notions of heterogeneity and multivocality in the same ethnic group or family.",1774246445,,Dissertations & Theses," Vomvyla, E.VomvylaE.Vomvyla, E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989332031 , 102698532 , 101309 , 10020018 , 10020018 , http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1410698/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774246445?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1410698/ , (UMI)AAI10020018 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Voicing+the+stories+of+the+excluded%3A+albanian+families%27+history+and+heritage+making+at+the+crossroads+of+new+and+old+homes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vomvyla%2C+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Unconventional futures: anticipation, materiality, and the market in oil shale development","This thesis offers a political geography of unconventional energy development through a study of a particular fossil fuel resource called oil shale. Having long occupied a critical place in the politics and economy of certain states, most notably in Estonia, oil shale is now widely known as an ‘unconventional’ resource that is yet to become technically possible, commercially viable and socially acceptable to exploit. Following the movement through which oil shale becomes both unconventional and conventional, the thesis traces the resource through a series of geo-scientific, economic and political interventions. This study is based on analysis of technical literature and policy documents along with ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, and site visits conducted in Estonia, Colorado, Utah, Jordan, London and Brussels. Drawing together relational accounts of natural resources in political ecology and economic geography with insights from Science and Technology Studies, this project both contributes to critical research on the carbon economy and to recent debates on the concepts of materiality, anticipation, and marketization in social sciences. The thesis proposes a relational conceptualization of resource materiality, situating oil shale in multiple and conflicting forms which derive from geographically disparate practices in both resource assessment and technological development. The future of oil shale exploitation is not pre-determined by the process of global resource decline, nor is it precluded by international demands to move towards lower-carbon futures. Rather, it is determined through the conjunction of different future-oriented economic and political calculations that are entangled with resource materials and associated technological systems. Developing a non-essentialist account of markets as socio-technically distributed arrangements, the thesis argues that these rival calculations influence the design of market rules for both energy and emissions trading. The thesis concludes that what counts as ‘unconventional’ is not given, but continues to be both created and contested at the same time as it is ‘conventionalized’.",1775215392,,Dissertations & Theses," Kama, KärgKamaKärgKama, Kärg", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3992931351 , 89355192 , 101309 , 10044831 , 10044831 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c08589c9-d82a-4c6e-926e-36202bf2060a", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775215392?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c08589c9-d82a-4c6e-926e-36202bf2060a , (UMI)AAI10044831 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unconventional+futures%3A+anticipation%2C+materiality%2C+and+the+market+in+oil+shale+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kama%2C+K%C3%A4rg&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Tracing the cold war in colombian architecture: a disregarded legacy,"Drawing on a social and cultural analysis of the architecture designed and built by the state during the Colombian military dictatorship of the 1950s, and based on original sources, including historical archives, declassified official reports, oral history, and raw blueprints, this PhD research project traces relationships between architecture, and the national and international politics of that time. In doing so, this research analyses the relation between the built environment and power, questioning traditional concepts of representation and identity. It will be argued that behind the nationalist discourse, the nationwide consolidation of modern architecture should also be seen as a camouflaged instrument of the Cold War. As part of the contemporary debate about the worldwide impact of the Cold War, this research focuses on the architecture of the 'National Policy of Public Works' developed during Rojas Pinilla's dictatorship (1953-1957). It takes as a case study one of the regime’s most emblematic projects: the Naval College 'Almirante Padilla' - ENAP, using it as a methodological instrument through which larger issues can be traced: the architecture is taken to be a materialization of the political project of a ‘new state’ in Latin America, according to the policies implemented across the hemisphere during the Cold War. State architecture was explicitly used as a political device of the aspiring 'welfare state' amidst a social and governmental controversial context. This state architecture co-opted the Modern Movement, simultaneously developing modern facilities, and following other agendas. What will be articulated here is a critical view of this seemingly neutral infrastructure by questioning how this shaped what I will refer to as a ‘conflictual identity’.",1777322780,,Dissertations & Theses," Sanchez Beltran, M.

Fictional depictions of limit experiences such as torture are deeply rooted in discourses about remembering and forgetting. I argue that the frequently used term “open secret” is a misnomer which is taken up in literature in order to be critiqued through narrative fragmentation and shifting generic frames. My project is interdisciplinary, and studies literary and anthropological discussions of torture as both a politicized and sexualized system. I address the problem of representing torture and raise questions about the status of historiography and its place within French, Algerian, and trans-Mediterranean discourses. My first chapter, “Histories repeating,” examines how and why fictional accounts of torture and its aftermath tend to deliberately conflate and intertwine various historical periods. Making individual memories of physical violence the subject of fiction, the authors I discuss narrativize the historical reality of torture in order to illustrate the longue durée and endless repeatability of violence. Being tortured and witnessing torture affects how one is able to transmit the memory of that act, as illustrated by the use of imbricated and hallucinatory narratives in generically diverse texts. Novels by Leïla Marouane and Antonin Varenne, and a short story by Assia Djebar, reveal the persistence of the Algerian War of Independence in contemporary fiction, and oblige readers to adopt a multidirectional approach to reading, as the text employs the same strategy to remember (and forget) extreme violence. In Chapter One, I also argue that texts employing a multidirectional approach to memories of the Algerian War and its aftermaths often work to de-inscribe the law that is written onto bodies. By creating characters that are, in one way or another, survivors and narrators of torture, the texts reject the hegemonic markers of torture, and criticize the systems that uphold victime/bourreau identitarianism. In Chapter Two, “The Tortured Body and the Narrativization of the Impossible,” I turn to the oeuvre of Assia Djebar, whose career-long engagement with questions of history and individual and collective memory is evident in all of her texts, to discuss how the transmission of the story of torture is inscribed on the body. I refer to the mise en récit of these stories as a narrativization of the impossible, an impossibility that is predicated on the female body as a concrete trace of an act that is often denied or repressed by the individual. In the collection Femmes d’Alger dans leur appartement (1980) and novel La Femme sans sépulture (2002), Djebar rejects memory as a process at the service of the post-Independence State, and the various forms of transmission of violent narratives in her texts are a movement against monolithic forms of history-making. Rather than taking up positions as lieux de mémoire , static sites that work towards a national conception of memory and history, the narratives I examine refuse memorialization and allow instead an open-ended narrative that must be physically passed down in order to circulate in the face of renewed violence in Algeria. In my final chapter, “Testimonial texts: writing the obscene,” I move away from fictional accounts of the aftermath of torture to explore the testimonial genre. Looking to first-person texts by Henri Alleg, Djamila Boupacha and Louisette Ighilarhiz, I argue that metropolitan French intellectuals had to intervene in their circulation and reception in order to mitigate the social and political unacceptability of these texts that are figured as “obscene.” Ross Chambers’ analysis of testimonial writing as both “untimely” and “obscene” acts in Untimely Interventions: AIDS Writing, Testimonial and the Rhetoric of Haunting underpins my argument that the description of torture in testimonial narratives is an exploration of the obscene; a state of affairs that allows for continual personal and systematic denial of the existence of torture and torture victims. The prevalence of sexual violence and rape and its place in French and Algerian cultural and social memory is also central to Chapter Three and my discussion of the textually obscene: torture is both hors scène , out of sight of the public, and obscene in the kind of limit experience it means for the victim and the torturer. The contrast between private and public discourses and the dissonance that can occur when narratives try to cross the public/private divide complicate how stories of torture are made available and received by readers. Reading testimonial accounts as textual incursions that embody the obscenity of torture and its physical effects, I argue that the paratextual support of French intellectuals was a necessary aspect of the transmission of primary torture narratives during the war. This mediation simultaneously shielded readers from the shock of events that were purposely kept “off-stage,” and, paradoxically, highlighted the details of testimony that were the most contentious: descriptions of sexual violence, protracted legal struggles, and the blurred border between the French “us” and the Algerian “them.” Multidirectional memory, another form of mediation that transmits narratives of torture, describes a shuttling between separate traumatic memories that are ultimately told together. I use Michael Rothberg’s theory to explain and analyze the hinging effect often present more recent fictional texts on the Algerian War that are preoccupied with both the legacy of the War of Independence and the more immediate violence of Algeria’s décennie noire . Using these narrative theories, I argue that the transmission of narratives of torture, be they fictional or testimonial, relies on a certain degree of mediation or deferral. I posit the transmission, or making public, of these stories as both individual and collective, and marked by a necessarily complex relationship to history, memory, and the physical traces of violence. By analyzing both Algerian and hexagonal French literature that addresses torture during the Algerian War, my dissertation frames the “ Question ” of state-sponsored violence as an enduring transnational topos that creates a proliferation of ghosts, unanswerable questions, and unsolvable crimes. As a project that engages with both hexagonal French and Francophone texts, my dissertation offers a new theory of how literature can engage with and defy taboos on memorial transmission and publically-recognizable grievances, and how the memory of torture is narrativized and circulated.",1778102380,,Dissertations & Theses," Vendetti, MariaVendettiMariaVendetti, Maria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4009197131 , 87704822 , 66569 , 9781339581958 , 10075563 , 10075563", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781339581958, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1778102380?accountid=14496, 0313 Romance literature, 0313 Romance literature, 0313 Romance literature,, 0313 Romance literature, Romance literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Algeria , France , Memory , Narrative , Torture , War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Le+Retour+de+%27La+Question%27%3A+Torture%2C+memory%0Aand+narrative+in+contemporary+French+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vendetti%2C+Maria&amp;isbn=9781339581958&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Citizenship, the 'self' and the 'other': perspectives of citizenship educators regarding citizenship, with, focus on religious and cultural difference","In recent decades, we have seen a resurrection of debates concerning what it means to be a citizen. Developments such as transnational migrations, rising socio-economic inequalities, the ""War(s) on Terror"", and political movements based on absolutist ideologies, continue to raise broader questions of justice, equality, quality of life and social cohesion. This research project aimed to study and critically examine perspectives of citizenship held by citizenship educators and the conceptions of citizenship that inform them. Because citizenship includes a number of dimensions. and given Britain's transformation into a multicultural . and multi-faith society with far-reaching implications for citizenship, this study concentrated on developing an understanding towards dealing with religious and cultural difference in the sphere of education. Additionally, qualitative interview data were collected and the q-methodology with thirty five citizenship educators across England. The research findings revealed that citizenship educators held one of three distinct shared perspectives (SPI. SP2, and SP3) on citizenship (as well as some areas of commonality). While there were overlaps among these perspectives, broadly, SP 1 gravitated towards the liberal conception of citizenship. SP2 placed great value on social-democratic citizenship and SP3 associated most strongly with multicultural citizenship. Moreover, all three viewpoints drew from features of cosmopolitan citizenship. In all. these teachers gleaned from beliefs, values and aims originating from a range of conceptions of citizenship to form their shared perspec tives. That said, it was contended that these conceptions of citizenship all entailed c ritic isms in perceiving and dealing with contemporary realities; therefore, a strategic approach with regard to the conceptualization and pedagogy of citizenship was proposed. This thesis argued that different conceptions of citizenship as well as visions of the 'Self' in relation to the 'Other' (exclusivist, inclusivist, pluralist) should be explicitly, openly and critically examined in the cultural. political and especially in the educational institutions of society.",1779233998,,Dissertations & Theses," Ajani, MalikAjaniMalikAjani, Malik", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013233341 , 102698582 , 101309 , 10072404 , 10072404", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779233998?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10072404 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Citizenship%2C+the+%27self%27+and+the+%27other%27%3A+perspectives+of+citizenship+educators+regarding+citizenship%2C+with%2C+focus+on+religious+and+cultural+difference&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ajani%2C+Malik&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"In times of liquid modernity: experiences of the paralympic student-athlete,"This phenomenological study explores the life-worlds of eight Paralympic student-athletes by employing the conceptual framework of Zygmunt Bauman’s Liquid Modernity (2000), and utilising Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, Flowers &amp; Larkin, 2009) as a method of data gathering and analysis. The study aimed to answer the main research question: To what extent is Bauman’s Liquid Modernity an effective metaphor for describing the life of a Paralympic student-athlete. Accounts concerning the lived experience of each of the participants’ life-worlds were gathered via semi-structured interviews and analysed through a double hermeneutic process of interpretation producing a multitude of intricate, intimate and personal themes for each participant. Analysed and presented as individual case studies, the research demonstrates the uniqueness of experience despite the existence of common and shared life environments. Collectively, the themes from each account were then explored via the lens of Bauman’s sociology, identifying connections with Bauman’s considerations of Identity, Otherness, Culture and Belonging in times of liquid modernity. Six key areas were identified for discussion: i) Sport as a container for Liquid life; ii) The problem of Identity; iii) Moving beyond the Social Model of Disability; iv) Belonging to the Paralympic movement; v) The creation of Otherness; vi) The Liquid life of the Paralympic Student-Athlete. iv The research concludes that the metaphor of Bauman’s Liquid Modernity can be used to provide insight to the phases of liquidity being experienced at an individual / psychological level, providing a demonstration of how the concept might be explored within the realms of the sociology of sport, with a specific focus on the Paralympic student-athlete. However, the study also demonstrates a need for research to explore Bauman’s Liquid Modernity at the micro-level to elucidate why some of his global observations withstand for the individual life-words of the participants, and why some observations seemed very much at odds with the accounts provided for this study.",1780250244,,Dissertations & Theses," Campbell, NatalieCampbellNatalieCampbell, Natalie", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018880401 , 103451552 , 101309 , 10062206 , 10062206 , http://roar.uel.ac.uk/3930/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780250244?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://roar.uel.ac.uk/3930/ , (UMI)AAI10062206 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+times+of+liquid+modernity%3A+experiences+of+the+paralympic+student-athlete&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Campbell%2C+Natalie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Development aid in struggles for world order: czechoslovak foreign aid during the cold war,"This thesis reconstructs the history of Czechoslovak foreign aid 1948-1989, based on published and unpublished documents of the period. I propose a periodization rooted in the global class struggle and the internal dynamics of the Soviet commonwealth, within a historical sociological framework of uneven and combined development. Czechoslovakia was the USSR's most active ally in the provision of foreign aid to Third World governments and national liberation movements. Early optimism about the anti-colonial movement was reflected in ambitious attempts to expand Soviet style social relations and forms of state. This gave way to a more cautious programme corresponding to the Soviet bloc strategy of 'peaceful coexistence.' The rulers of non-aligned countries effectively became the revolutionary subject in Soviet and Czechoslovak theories of world revolution, and the adhesion of the non-aligned countries to Soviet projects of world order became the primary motivation for provision of foreign aid. There was also an expansion of foreign aid to support the development of trade with solvent non-aligned countries, and a corresponding decline in aid to those non-European countries of socialist orientation which were not of geopolitical interest to the Soviet bloc. This pattern was modified somewhat during the early 1980s, when the resurgent military confrontation with the US-led western bloc led to an expansion of Czechoslovak foreign aid to selected strategic allies. Early attempts to overcome the conditions of uneven and combined development by extension of the Soviet political economy gave way in most countries to policies which tended to reproduce uneven and combined development at a higher level of industrialisation and economic integration. Non European countries that joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance were more able to close the gap with the European socialist bloc, but by the 1980s, a growing use of market mechanisms meant that multilateral mechanisms in the socialist bloc also tended to reinforce and reproduce uneven and combined development. Foreign aid is approached using a historical materialist analysis, drawing on Leon Trotsky's theory of uneven and combined development and permanent revolution, and Antonio Gramsci's concepts of hegemony and passive revolution. The vacillation of the Czechoslovak and Soviet aid systems between attempts to overcome the uneven and combined development of the non-European socialist countries on the one hand, and efforts to extract a short-term benefit from these conditions and to recreate them at a higher level of development on the other hand is explained as a reflection of the transitional nature of the Soviet social formation as nether state capitalist nor fully socialist. The Soviet contestation of western hegemony is explored in three dimensions: expansion of non-capitalist social relations, expansion of particular state forms, and promotion of a particular world order.",1780275295,,Dissertations & Theses," Novak, AdamNovakAdamNovak, Adam", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018865021 , 103112462 , 101309 , 10070662 , 10070662", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780275295?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10070662 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Development+aid+in+struggles+for+world+order%3A+czechoslovak+foreign+aid+during+the+cold+war&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Novak%2C+Adam&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Crossing borders in taiwan new cinema: historiography, popularity, postcoloniality","Focusing on Taiwan New Cinema from its inception in 1982 to the present, this thesis examines the key features of historical representation, dramatic genre and postcolonial discourse. Taiwan New Cinema configures the different political formations of Taiwanese culture, and deals with the historical, social and cultural relations between Taiwanese culture and other cultures such as Mainland Chinese, American and Japanese. I argue that Taiwan New Cinema has become a vital cultural space wherein questions of national borders and identities are being renegotiated. This thesis will investigate Taiwan New Cinema and its historical and cultural phenomena from three directions. First, it aims to develop an understanding of constructed national identities by examining how Taiwanese history has been written within the Taiwan New Cinema movement and by considering Taiwan cinema in the light of the concept of national cinema. Part 1 proposes that Taiwan New Cinema is the site of a dynamic contestation in the representation of Chinese exile, shifting from a monumental style aimed at encouraging a sense of collective identity to a more self-reflexive and critical approach. Second, this dissertation attempts to reevaluate domestic genres by mapping the spaces culturally occupied by selected new wave film texts produced to challenge, in various ways, the dominant realist aesthetics. Part 2 argues that Taiwan New Cinema tackles the issue of American neocolonialism by exploring the significance of popular genre in Taiwan, especially the effects of the Cold War on Taiwan society. Third, this dissertation is concerned with the way in which postcolonial discourse is inscribed in Taiwan New Cinema. Since the 1990s, there have been transnational trends in deploying Taiwan New Cinema as a site of cultural translation for addressing postcolonial subjects or responses to Japanese contemporary culture. Part 3 reveals a diverse landscape in film narrative, subject matter and cinematic style in relation to an attempt to reimagine the colonial past.",1784059936,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Wan-JuiWangWan-JuiWang, Wan-Jui", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017532631 , 93841502 , 101309 , U618665 , U618665 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/14925", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784059936?accountid=14496, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0459 Communication, Communication," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/14925 , (UMI)AAIU618665 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crossing+borders+in+taiwan+new+cinema%3A+historiography%2C+popularity%2C+postcoloniality&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Wan-Jui&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An evaluation of the contribution of the uk airport master planning system to more sustainable development,"Airport development is a highly controversial process with communities becoming increasingly aware of the negative impacts that air transport operations can have on the local and global environment. Such environmental impacts have the potential to constrain growth and cause airport community conflict, as well as posing operational challenges including scheduling problems and reduced runway capacity. Thus, if the air transport industry is to grow sustainably it must simultaneously meet the needs of society and contribute to economic development, whilst limiting damage to the environment. In response to this challenge, in 2003 the UK Department for Transport published the Government aviation policy document The Future of Air Transport which invited airports forecast to have a minimum of 20,000 air transport movements per year to produce a Master Plan that documented their development proposals to 2030, and the likely adverse social and environmental impacts. Airports were recommended to engage with stakeholders during this process, thereby facilitating a range of stakeholder groups' involvement in development processes. A review of key literature explores the air transport industry, stakeholder engagement, and environmental assessment procedures to provide a lens through which Master Plans can be assessed and best practice from the external procedures established. It was revealed that there is a clear connectivity between Master Plans, environmental management, and public participation; and as such the core outcomes that could be achieved from the strategic planning process include improved environmental performance, social learning and sustainable development. The content of the Master Plans produced by the airports owned and operated by BAA and Manchester Airports Group were reviewed to evaluate the methods employed by reference to the established best practice. From this, three initial case study airports were examined, Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester; followed by a fourth verification case study of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Document analysis and interviews with key actors were utilised to explore the master planning processes, identify current practice and outline areas for improvement. Principle findings identified that Master Plans have the potential to yield more environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable development outcomes, however, this potential has largely not been realised. Master planning was hindered by the non-statutory nature of the master plan process; the flexibility afforded by the Department for Transport Master Plan Guidance; the absence of follow up or repercussions for poor master planning processes; and airports apparent reluctance to fully engage with stakeholders. It is therefore recommended that future master planning includes the publication of more prescriptive guidance; the provision of airport training to highlight the benefits of undertaking a comprehensive process; the introduction of repercussions if Master Plans fall below a certain standard such as an audit or a published review to identify poor practice; and the introduction of elements of environmental assessment procedure best practice. This thesis presents the most recent and comprehensive assessment of master planning for UK airports, advancing previous reviews through comparisons with external procedures. The research is both novel and timely particularly given the scope for policy changes within the UK air transport industry and the policy commitments to sustainable development. A significant contribution to knowledge is made through the original comparison between Master Plans and environmental assessment procedures and the subsequent establishment of criteria to enhance future master plans. Furthermore, the thesis contributes to the development of theories of participatory decision making and advances the debate on stakeholder engagement and its utility within the aviation sector, providing well-timed recommendations to both airports and policy makers.",1785481432,,Dissertations & Theses," Rawson, Rebecca RobynRawsonRobynRebeccaRawson, Rebecca Robyn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018876971 , 103112542 , 101309 , 10059530 , 10059530", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1785481432?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10059530 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+evaluation+of+the+contribution+of+the+uk+airport+master+planning+system+to+more+sustainable+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rawson%2C+Rebecca+Robyn&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Disaster and the dynamics of memory,"Calls for examining the interrelations between individual and collective processes of remembering have been repeatedly made within the field of memory studies. With the tendency being to focus on either the individual or the collective level, there have been few studies that have undertaken this task in an empirically informed manner. This thesis seeks to engage in such an examination by undertaking a multi-level study of the remembrance of the Bhopal gas disaster of 1984. The gas leak in Bhopal (India) was one of the world s worst industrial disasters and has seen a long-running political contestation involving state institutions, social movement organisations (SMOs) and individual survivors. Employing an ethnographic methodology, incorporating interviews, participant observation and archival research, the study seeks to examine similarities and divergences in how these institutional, group-level and individual actors have remembered the disaster. It identifies the factors that modulated these remembrances and focuses on examining the nature of their interrelationship. The study conceptualises remembering as memory-work : an active process of meaning-making in relation to the past. The memory-work of state institutions was examined within the judicial and commemorative domains. The analysis demonstrates how state institutions engaged in a limiting of the meaning of the disaster removing from view the transnational causality of the event and the issue of corporate liability. It tracks how the survivors suffering was dehistoricised and contained within the framework of a localized claims bureaucracy. The examination of SMO memory-work focused on the activities of the two most prominent groups working in Bhopal. The analysis reveals how both organisations emphasise the continuing suffering of the survivors to challenge the state s settlement of the event. However, clear differences are outlined between the two groups in the wider frameworks of meaning employed by them to explain the suffering, assign responsibility and define justice. Memory-work at the individual level was accessed in the memory narratives of individual survivors generated through ethnographic interviews. The study examined how individual survivors have made sense of the lived experience of suffering caused by the disaster and its aftermath. The analysis revealed how the frameworks of meaning imposed by the state are deeply incommensurate with the survivors needs to express the multi-dimensionality of their suffering; it tracks how the state imposed identities are resisted but cannot be entirely overcome in individual remembrance. Engagement with the activities of the SMOs is demonstrated as enabling the development of an alternative activist remembrance for a limited group of survivors. Overall, the thesis seeks to provide a complex and empirically grounded account of the relations between the inner, individual level processes of memory linked to lived experience and the wider, historically inflected, collective and institutional registers of remembrance. The examination of the encounters between these diverse individual and collective remembrances in the context of an on-going political contestation allows the study to contribute to ongoing discussions within the field about memory politics in a global age and memory and justice.",1788101567,,Dissertations & Theses," Bisht, PawasBishtPawasBisht, Pawas", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018876341 , 102698502 , 101309 , 10051464 , 10051464 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/14184", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788101567?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/14184 , (UMI)AAI10051464 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Disaster+and+the+dynamics+of+memory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bisht%2C+Pawas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Between continuity and change: narratives of polish migrants in belfast,"On 1st May 2004, Poland- along with nine other countries- joined the European Union. Three of the existing members- the UK, Ireland and Sweden- granted unrestricted employment and residence rights to the nationals of the new member states immediately after accession. What followed was the largest movement of people in Europe since the Second World War. Belfast, Northern Ireland,- which up until then had small levels of inward migration from abroad and certainly very few migrants from Poland- experienced a large in-flow of Polish migrants in a very short space of time. All of this made the city a unique research setting for this study. The thesis 'Between continuity and change- Narratives of Polish migrants in Belfast provides an insight into migrants biographical developments as experienced in their day-to-day interactions, examined within the theoretical framework of interpretative sociology. As it is argued in th is thesis, biographies equip individuals with a frame of orientation in their changing milieux and become an arena for the continuous renegotiation of the meaning of self, their life-worlds and those of other people. Deriving from twenty seven biographical narrative interviews with Polish post-accession migrants in Belfast, this thesis displays the complexities of migrants' transnational social practices, suggesting that, at times, these practices add to the widening of the gap between 'here' and 'the re', that can trigger a Slate of non-belonging and result in a slow course of divergence between migrants and their relatives and friends in the homeland. By analysing the 'personal communities' formed by migrants in the migration context, this thesis also contributes some alternative interpretations of the common- in recent literature on Polish migration- statements on in-group distrust and rivalry amongst Polish co-nationals abroad. This study additionally outlines the differences in the development of the above processes amongst migrants in different occupational groups in Northern Ireland.",1788103363,,Dissertations & Theses," Bell, Justyna KatarzynaBellKatarzynaJustynaBell, Justyna Katarzyna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018870371 , 103112472 , 101309 , 10039943 , 10039943", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788103363?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10039943 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+continuity+and+change%3A+narratives+of+polish+migrants+in+belfast&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bell%2C+Justyna+Katarzyna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Lifestyle aspects of a core creative class when home and away: a study with reference to the ouseburn valley, newcastle upon tyne","This study investigates aspects of working artists’ lives when in their home environments and when travelling and holidaying in the elsewhere. Artists are seen by Florida (2002) as being a central group in the functioning of a new creative economy in the West based within a global division of labour. This creative economy is seen to be founded on the proliferation of bohemias in cities as catalysts of growth and regeneration, as artists are seen to attract further ‘creative capital’, and form new directions of consumption and lifestyle through their creative outputs and practices. Surprisingly, very little study has been done that gives voice to artists in relation to aspects of their lifestyles, that may inform new directions of consumption. Just as importantly, artists’ views in relation to changing bohemias, wrought through gentrification processes, have often been ignored. This thesis investigates the meanings of place, changing place through gentrification, leisure practices and the travel and tourism preferences of this group. Empirical findings suggest that a desire for an integrated life that blurs the boundaries of work, leisure and travel or holidaying is important to this group. Creativity is a central aspect that permeates the life world of my participants. Gentrification processes are viewed negatively or ambivalently. These processes are not predominantly disparaged due to fears of immediate displacement however, but are related to ideas of changing place, including the social makeup of newer users of the Ouseburn Valley and their sheer numbers, and the associated increased levels of bureaucratic regulation and commercial interests in the formerly ‘marginal’ Valley. During the course of the study, empirical and theoretical directions led to the construction of what I have termed a ‘governing ethic’ that can be seen to inform many of the discourses and practices discussed in relation to the working artist in the Ouseburn Valley. This ethic is one that promotes an integrated life of self-expressive individualism. It is seen to have origins within the Romantic Movement in the late 18th Century, and can be detected in creative-countercultural ideologies and practices up until the end of the 20th century.",1799042366,,Dissertations & Theses," Whiting, JamesWhitingJamesWhiting, James", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4031292201 , 104172222 , 101309 , U608891 , U608891 , http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/4015/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1799042366?accountid=14496," 0357 Fine arts , 0628 Individual & family studies"," 0357 Fine arts , 0628 Individual & family studies"," 0357 Fine arts , 0628 Individual & family studies", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0357 Fine arts , 0628 Individual & family studies"," Fine arts , Individual & family studies"," http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/4015/ , (UMI)AAIU608891 , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , England",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lifestyle+aspects+of+a+core+creative+class+when+home+and+away%3A+a+study+with+reference+to+the+ouseburn+valley%2C+newcastle+upon+tyne&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Whiting%2C+James&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Exodus: towards a non-identity art,"Contemporary western societies are in a state of flux approaching crisis; elected governments appear dictated to by private interests while employment appears increasingly precarious. Crippling poverty is rife across the world while a global war over resources is perpetuated under the guise of freedom. The potential of art, the art world and the artist within this matrix may appear an entirely indulgent debate. However, humanity associates the field with some of its greatest achievements. Considering this, it must have some agency to affect consciousness and social change. I did not hold this outlook at the outset of the research. It was instigated from a perspective that saw the loci of art as limited in their agency to effect social and political change. Considering this, it set itself the task of discovering a potent artist exit from the dominant model of art and its underlying hierarchies of values and societal functions. The research is a practical and conceptual search for an alternative model of art. Taking inspiration from Paolo Virno’s political strategy of exodus (Virno, 2004: 70), the research addresses and quantifies the artist exit from art, the art world and authorship. It deploys a multimethodology which consists of a theoretical/ investigative enquiry, reflexive experimental art production, participant-observation and auto-ethnographic writing. The written thesis develops a historical, cultural and geographic inquiry through a phenomenological and discursive approach. The art production includes personal, ambiguous work alongside experimental, site-specific interventions and collaborations with a series of artist-activist and activist groups. Like the nation state and the museum, our conception of the artist is ‘an ideological product’ of the Enlightenment (Foucault, 1984: 119). Karl Marx foresaw art as an activity that everyone did in the Communist society (Marx, 1978: 160) and Joseph Beuys argued that every human being is an artist (Beuys, 1992: 902). Seeking to develop upon such thought, the thesis argues for the artist exit from conventional authorship and simultaneous affirmation of an egalitarian mode of art production and distribution. The double movement is critical to avoid slipping into a nihilist vacuum. Following the logic of the Salon des Refusés that heralded the emergence of the avant-garde in the 19th century, the thesis should manifest in exhibitions wherein anyone can exhibit. In so doing, it seeks to problematize the hierarchy within art and the alienation and identity divisions between artists and non-artists. Though theorised, the thesis remains dormant knowledge. The motives for this thesis is to incrementally further the egalitarian drive through fostering the agency of the many in art discourse, practice and research. Inspired by Adorno’s negative dialectics, this would strive to be a non-identity art. Adorno’s non-identity thought rejects strong self–identification alongside a commitment to egalitarianism. As it demands ‘thinking against itself’ (Adorno, 1973: 365), the proposed thesis is not fixed or dogmatic; indeed it will be negated at the close. Ultimately, the theorisation of a non-identity art is more so a polemical and tentative hypothesis to engender a reconsideration of the authorship and ownership of the field of art. The application of negation, non-identity and the negative dialectical method in art research is the original contribution to knowledge. Considering this, the method of the study is as important as its content.",1865273994,,Dissertations & Theses," Harron, Rory JosephHarronJosephRoryHarron, Rory Joseph", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4312292611 , 110134962 , 101309 , 10302859 , 10302859 , http://radar.gsa.ac.uk/4734/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865273994?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://radar.gsa.ac.uk/4734/ , (UMI)AAI10302859 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exodus%3A+towards+a+non-identity+art&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Harron%2C+Rory+Joseph&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Foraging Ecology of Banded Mongooses (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo &lt;/i&gt;): Epidemiological and Human-Wildlife Conflict Implications,"Free-ranging banded mongooses ( Mungos mungo ) in northeastern Botswana are infected by a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex pathogen, M. mungi, which putatively infects mongooses through lesions in the skin (often the planum nasale) from an environmental reservoir. To understand the epidemiology of the yearly and highly seasonal outbreaks of M. mungi in this population of banded mongooses, researchers need to understand what factors influence banded mongoose exposure to M. mungi and banded mongoose susceptibility to M. mungi infection. Researchers have no baseline data on the behavioral ecology of this population of banded mongooses — such as home range dynamics, denning ecology, movement ecology, and foraging ecology, all of which may play a role in banded mongoose exposure to M. mungi. Further, researchers have highlighted the potential role of prolonged elevations of glucocorticoids in impairing cellmediated immunity, which would play a significant role in determining susceptibility to a mycobacterium such as M. mungi, however, researchers have no data on the endocrinology of banded mongooses. Finally, researchers have not detected M. mungi infection in any other population of banded mongooses. Our study population has a gradient of troops (social groups) that vary from troops with extremely close association with humans in a town, to troops associated with humans at tourist lodges within the Chobe National Park, to troops with no discernible association with humans within the national park and surrounding forest reserve. Researchers have few data on how synanthropy (living with humans) affects banded mongoose behavioral ecology and no data on how synanthropy affects banded mongoose endocrinology. Researchers do not know whether or how the high level of synanthropy in this population of banded mongooses plays a role in the epidemiology of M. mungi outbreaks.

Further, researchers have highlighted the potential role of prolonged elevations of glucocorticoids in impairing cellmediated immunity, which would play a significant role in determining susceptibility to a mycobacterium such as M. mungi, however, researchers have no data on the endocrinology of banded mongooses.

Researchers do not know whether or how the high level of synanthropy in this population of banded mongooses plays a role in the epidemiology of M. mungi outbreaks. Thus, we document here some aspects of banded mongoose home range dynamics, movement metrics, denning ecology and foraging behavior for our study population in northeastern Botswana. We present a novel method for screening data from global positioning system (GPS) collars for large measurement error and we present a detailed home range study. We also document the spatio-temporal dynamics of glucocorticoid production among several banded mongoose study troops across our study site, using a non-invasive assay for fecal glucocorticoid metabolites, which we validated and also present here. We tested to see which factors, including nutritional limitation, predation risk, and reproduction (and associated competition, agonistic encounters, and predation), best explained the variation in glucocorticoid production among our study troops over several years. We found that the metrics traditionally used to screen data from GPS collars, horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) or fix dimension (2-D or 3-D), performed poorly relative to a new screening metric that we propose, the estimated elevation error (EEE). We propose that researchers use our screening method, which combines test data and a model-averaging information-theoretic framework that uses a priori candidate models of telemetry measurement error. Although we recommend including EEE in a priori candidate models, it may not describe telemetry error in other systems as well as it did in our own. Banded mongooses in our study population formed troops of a median of 13 adults (IQR: 11 to 21 adults) and these troops used home ranges of a median of 68 ha (IQR: 39 ha to 134 ha) with core areas of a median of 15 ha (IQR: 9 ha to 28 ha). These cores (statistically-clumped space use) occurred at a median volume contour of 66% (IQR: 58% to 71 %). Synanthropic troops showed more clumped area use than apoanthropic troops (those living away from humans). Synanthropic troops also used man-made structures for den sites in 81% of nights, fed from refuse sites in 13% of foraging observations, and drank from anthropogenic water sources in 78% of drinking observations. From our conducted adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge, we detected valid increases in fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in mongoose feces using our four tested enzymeimmunoassays. An 11-oxoetiocholanolone assay detecting 11,17-dioxoandrostanes (11,17-DOA) performed best. Using this assay, we detected expected decreases in fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations 48 h after administering dexamethasone sodium phosphate. We also validated this assay using biological events as challenges, in which captive mongooses showed higher fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations during reproductive activity, agonistic encounters, and depredation events. The time delay of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite excretion approximately corresponded with food transit time, at a minimum of approximately 24 h. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite metabolism was minimal up to 8 h post-defecation. Reproduction and its associated challenges dramatically increased glucocorticoid production, which otherwise remained low and stable in a captive troop with a constant food supply and lowered predation risk. Variation in glucocorticoid production in free-ranging banded mongooses was best explained by food limitation as described by current nutritional limitation (proportion of fecal organic matter), recent rainfall (which increases soil macrofauna availability), and access to concentrated anthropogenic food resources. Habitat differences in soil macrofauna density and reproductive events also explained variation in glucocorticoid production in free-ranging mongooses, but to a much lower degree. Predation risk, as measured by canopy cover (escape from aerial predators) and group size (decreased per capita vigilance) explained very little of the variation in glucocorticoid production. In the late dry season, banded mongooses in our population may face a “perfect storm” of nutritional limitation, agonistic encounters at concentrated food resources, aggressive evictions, estrus, competition for mates, parturition, and predation pressure on pups. We suspect that this prefect storm may push glucocorticoid responses into homeostatic overload and may impair cell-mediated immunity in banded mongooses.",1899582733,,Dissertations & Theses," Laver, Peter N.LaverN.PeterLaver, Peter N.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322387393 , 86636072 , 66569 , 9781369754827 , 10596518 , 10596518", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781369754827, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1899582733?accountid=14496," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0409 Endocrinology"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0409 Endocrinology"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0409 Endocrinology",," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0409 Endocrinology"," Wildlife Conservation , Ecology , Endocrinology"," Biological sciences , Banded mongoose , Botswana , Home range , Mycobacterium mungi",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Foraging+Ecology+of+Banded+Mongooses+%28Mungos+mungo+%29%3A+Epidemiological+and+Human-Wildlife+Conflict+Implications&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Laver%2C+Peter+N.&amp;isbn=9781369754827&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"French and Foreign: Émigré Authors in Occupied France,"My dissertation, ""French and Foreign: Émigré Writers in Occupied France,"" explores émigré authors from Eastern Europe who moved between adopted and native languages as they were forced to shift their cultural identities in Occupied France. These novelists, poets, and playwrights came to France in the 1920s, adopting French as their literary language. Their world was turned upside down when the Vichy regime and Nazi occupiers revoked their place in the French nation through discriminatory and Antisemitic laws. Literary studies have only recently turned to immigrant writers from Eastern Europe in the period of World War II. However, scholars have tended to study these authors in isolation, and have not tied them to the context of a generation of Eastern European francophone authors. Furthermore, recent scholarship in Eastern European francophonie focuses on the interwar period and the Cold War, while skipping entirely the Second World War. In light of contemporary theories about transnationalism and multilingualism, my comparative study analyzes émigré authors' choices under the Occupation as a form of intra-European francophonie . Reading these authors' published works alongside anterior manuscript versions, as well as their wartime correspondence and unpublished diaries, reveals that writing in an adopted language can be an expression of cultural assimilation, social displacement, or political resistance. This understudied transnational moment of the war provides an alternative view of French literary life and the canon of wartime literature; instead of pointing to who was excluded, I study how those who were cast out used literature to argue for a multiplicity of identities and languages within the French nation. The chapters of my dissertation correspond to literary and historical problems posed by the writers' specific involvement in the war, and are organized by pairs of émigré writers. Looking at pairs shows that émigré writers on opposite ends of the political spectrum or literary world were dealing with the same concerns in their writing. In the first two chapters, on Irène Némirovsky and Benjamin Fondane, I focus on literary representations of the June 1940 flight from Paris, known as the exode . They were particularly attuned to exile, since they themselves were already displaced. Writing in French about the exodus allowed one of these Jewish authors to reclaim and the other to deny her Judaism in the face of the threat of deportation and the crippling Statut des Juifs . In my second pair of chapters, I study foreigners in the Resistance, both in the internal and external movements. Though it may seem paradoxical, writing in French allowed Elsa Triolet and Romain Gary to maintain multinational and multilingual identities in the French resistance. Despite their political differences, members of the internal resistance and of the Free French Forces in London had similar concerns about exile and identity. I study Triolet's and Gary's writing in the context of a resistance movement that was in fact a multilingual and multinational space with an active multilingual clandestine press. In my final two chapters, on the origins of the Theater of the Absurd in World War II, I focus on Arthur Adamov and Eugène Ionesco. In my original research in diplomatic archives in Romania I discovered something I believe is virtually unknown about Ionesco: he first began to write in French and first worked on The Bald Soprano during his time in Vichy and not in the postwar period, as scholars have previously believed. I argue that Ionesco's and Adamov's wartime writings about the absurd, anchored in language play, helped determine the political choices they made during the darkest years of the Occupation.",1540785841,,Dissertations & Theses," Elsky, Julia LeahElskyLeahJuliaElsky, Julia Leah", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3350378581 , 88672282 , 66569 , 9781321050851 , 3580678 , 3580678", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321050851, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1540785841?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history"," 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history"," 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history",," 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history"," Modern literature , Romance literature , European history"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Emigre Writers , French Jewish Identity , Multilingualism , Occupied France , Translation , Vichy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=French+and+Foreign%3A+%C3%89migr%C3%A9+Authors+in+Occupied%0AFrance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elsky%2C+Julia+Leah&amp;isbn=9781321050851&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""Visionary Realism"" in the New Italian Political Cinema","My dissertation, directed by Professor Millicent Marcus and entitled ""Realismo Visionario"" nel nuovo cinema d'impegno italiano , focuses on the connection between the visionary and the representation of History in contemporary Italian films. Italian Neorealist cinema originated from the need to narrate in real time the vicissitudes of the war and the Resistance to the Nazi-fascists. This intent lead to the emergence of an 'aesthetic of reality' that set the rules for the following developments in Italian cinema in its willingness to deal with the representation of the historical past. Rossellini's Paisan is the most famous example of the documentary-like style that originated from the neorealist ethos. However, this 'aesthetic of reality' was not the only choice available to Italian directors willing to deal with the representation of historical events. As a matter of fact, many Italian films have built their narratives on visionary elements such as the visualization of dreams, dream-like states, or hallucinations. By calling for an aesthetic antithetical to that of Neorealism, the films I analyze propose an 'aesthetic of the visionary' as a means to negotiate the representation of history and individual subjectivity. Although present-day Italian filmmakers do not see themselves involved in any specific movement, I have been able to identify a corpus of films distinguished by what I call a ""visionary realism."" By this I mean a cinematic style deriving from the combination of two of Italian Cinema's most prominent characteristics, namely the documentary/realistic approach and the adoption of an oneiric/visionary gaze. My corpus of films include: Marco Bellocchio's Buongiorno, notte (2003), Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers (2003), Paolo Sorrentino's Il divo (2008), Nanni Moretti's Il caimano (2006) and Emanuele Crialese's Nuovomondo (2006). Every chapter of the dissertation is dedicated to a close reading of each film. On the one hand, I have considered these films as ""works of social interest,"" because they offer a critical and moral vision of Italian society and its history in general. On the other hand, I have interpreted their strong metacinematic component as a threefold attempt to deal primarily with the issues of cinema's reproductive aspects – that is, to take on the problematic relationship between the camera and the 'real' by staging 'real' historical episodes and characters; to consequently problematize the ethical notion of gaze , that is, the way in which the eye of the camera formalizes the world; to finally tie this problematization into the more general question of the formativity of seeing, experiencing and knowing. My research adopts a global and local perspective at once. I then connect my corpus of films both to the general discourse on the modernity of cinema that began in the middle of the Twentieth Century and to the national tradition of political cinema , addressed by the most recent scholarship in terms of Postmodern Impegno.",1542206304,,Dissertations & Theses," Rabissi, FrancescoRabissiFrancescoRabissi, Francesco", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3359468031 , 88786172 , 66569 , 9781321056525 , 3580836 , 3580836", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321056525, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1542206304?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies",," 0313 Romance literature , 0335 European history , 0900 Film studies"," Romance literature , European history , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Art cinema , Historical films , Italy , Marco Bellocchio , Paolo Sorrentino , Political cinema",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Visionary+Realism%22+in+the+New+Italian+Political+Cinema&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rabissi%2C+Francesco&amp;isbn=9781321056525&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cancer Viruses and the Construction of Biomedicine in the United States from 1900 to 1980,"This dissertation provides the first history of viral carcinogenesis that integrates its scientific, institutional, political, and social aspects. Unlike other theories of carcinogenesis, inquiry into the viral causes of cancer, by virtue of its association with the public health accomplishments of microbiology, promised widespread cancer prevention, if not elimination, through vaccination. Later in the twentieth century, the simplicity of cancer viruses offered appealing targets for molecular biologists seeking a means of transferring their practices from prokaryotic bacteria to eukaryotic animal cells. Cancer viruses therefore provide a productive site to consider the relationships between the laboratory, the clinic, and public health defined by the development of biomedicine at the intersection of biology and medicine as separate fields. Over the course of the twentieth century, biomedicine has emerged as an important site for understanding health and illness, defining individual identity, and seeking economic gains. In following cancer viruses this dissertation advances two principal arguments about the broader history of biomedicine. First, the rise of the laboratory in biomedical research was a social as well as a scientific process. Cancer viruses allow us to trace the movement of disease research from clinical observations of human patients to laboratory studies of animals to the manipulation of experimental systems to in vitro experimentation. The use and legitimacy of different model systems or instruments for the study of human disease were closely tied to the interests and agendas of the governmental, philanthropic, and commercial patrons of biomedical research. Cancer viruses, in particular, were a point of contact between these different patronage regimes. This history suggests that the development of laboratory-based biological sciences, such as molecular biology, was much more closely tied to medical concerns and popular enthusiasm than prior accounts allow. However, these patrons did not exert absolute control over these movements. Research into cancer viruses as external agents of cancer resulted in the discovery of internal genetic agents of cancer, oncogenes, in the late 1970s—hardly its intended result. Second, this dissertation claims that biomedicine should be understood as an important area of state formation in the United States after the Second World War. Until the mid-twentieth century, the federal government was a marginal sponsor of biomedical research. However, at the end of the century the vast majority of such research, not only in biomedicine but also in the biological sciences, was underwritten by the National Institutes of Health. As the state increased its support for research, it also sought to direct and hasten is therapeutic benefits. Here, the idea of vaccination against cancer provided an appealing target for intervention. Cancer virus research was a critical part of the so-called War on Cancer in the 1970s, whose ambitions, technocratic ethos, and frustration matched other ambitious acts of state-building during the 1960s and 1970s, including the War on Poverty and the Vietnam War. One theme that runs through this dissertation is institutional, particularly the set of initiatives undertaken by the United States National Cancer Institute to foster and manage cancer virus research through the controversial Virus Cancer Program. Cancer viruses existed, not only as scientific objects in the laboratory, but also as ""administrative objects"" for state management. While the ambitions of the Program were frustrated, the infrastructure it created offers a case study of large-scale, organized biomedical research before the start of the Human Genome Project, which is usually taken as the beginning of ""big biomedicine."" Principally, this dissertation follows cancer viruses in the most literal sense—tracing their points of emergence and their trajectories through public health and laboratory research. Rous Sarcoma Virus, the first cancer virus to be observed in 1911, ties together the early challenges of fitting cancer viruses within the causal schema of infectious disease, but also the emergence of a molecular genetic schema for cancer causation—oncogenes—in the 1970s. Simian Virus 40 links vaccination campaigns for polio with the rise of molecular techniques in cancer research.

Global education movements have led to an increase in access to schooling by rural and Indigenous populations but high drop-out rates persist and education policies, curricular contents, and teacher trainings have progressively become urban-biased and insensitive to context (Barter, 2008). Using Guatemala as my research site, this study offers to improve our understandings of the challenges faced by teachers to provide quality education in rural and Indigenous settings. It also analyzes the potential of pedagogical mentorship as an in-service teacher training resource that considers contextual realities and advances the fulfillment of the right to culturally and linguistically relevant education. This qualitative and multisite research study draws on critical and post foundational epistemologies and on extensive qualitative data collected over a six month period through in-depth interviews, participant observation and document analysis. Results demonstrate that the main challenges faced by rural teachers include economic hardships, malnutrition, inadequate and superficial teacher training in intercultural bilingual education and the persistent absence of basic government social programs. The data also reveal a positive acceptance and demand for pedagogical mentorship on behalf of all the interviewed teachers; particularly to enhance their knowledge and skills on bilingual intercultural education. Teachers agree on mentorship's potential to bring more culturally and linguistically relevant education, yet they also emphasize concerns for these programs' politicization. Patronage politics are feared to lead to forgo intended mentorship goals and to the hiring of unqualified mentors. Pedagogical mentorship offers a powerful opportunity for the Guatemalan government to enhance quality and context sensitive education but is not enough. Educational authorities need to move beyond the superficial inclusion of Indigenous languages, cultures and knowledges in curricular contents and teacher education and dismantle the apartheid of knowledge (Delgado Bernal &amp; Villalpando, 2002), language and socioeconomic opportunities. Multi sectorial efforts are necessary to tackle poverty, hunger and education and move towards the implementation of the long overdue right for rural and Indigenous peoples to access quality education which includes healthy students and linguistically and culturally relevant curricula.",1545887838,,Dissertations & Theses," de la Garza, Katyde la GarzaKatyde la Garza, Katy", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3377099381 , 89140012 , 66569 , 9781303931581 , 3621767 , 3621767", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303931581, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1545887838?accountid=14496," 0458 Education Policy , 0530 Teacher education , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0458 Education Policy , 0530 Teacher education , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0458 Education Policy , 0530 Teacher education , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0458 Education Policy , 0530 Teacher education , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Education Policy , Teacher education , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Education , Guatemala , In-service training , Indigenous people , Mentorship , Poverty , Rural education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pedagogical+mentorship%2C+indigenous+settings%2C+and+rural+education%3A+Perspectives+from+Guatemalan+teachers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=de+la+Garza%2C+Katy&amp;isbn=9781303931581&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Critical Effects of Urbanization on a Charismatic Carnivore: Genetic Change, Disease and Toxicant Exposure, and Disease Susceptibility in Bobcat Populations in an Urban, Fragmented Landscape","Urbanization has profound ecological impacts that reach beyond city boundaries. Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity. To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote ( Canis latrans ) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by &gt; 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline. Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape. I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for &gt; 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.",1548325831,,Dissertations & Theses," Serieys, Laurel Elizabeth KleinSerieysElizabeth KleinLaurelSerieys, Laurel Elizabeth Klein", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3384034011 , 89306132 , 66569 , 9781303938931 , 3622251 , 3622251", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303938931, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1548325831?accountid=14496," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0369 Genetics , 0408 Conservation"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0369 Genetics , 0408 Conservation"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0369 Genetics , 0408 Conservation",," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0369 Genetics , 0408 Conservation"," Wildlife Conservation , Ecology , Genetics , Conservation"," Biological sciences , Anticoagulant rodenticides , Bobcats , Disease , Immunology , Notoedric mange , Urbanization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Critical+Effects+of+Urbanization+on+a+Charismatic+Carnivore%3A+Genetic+Change%2C+Disease+and+Toxicant+Exposure%2C+and+Disease+Susceptibility+in+Bobcat+Populations+in+an+Urban%2C+Fragmented+Landscape&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Serieys%2C+Laurel+Elizabeth+Klein&amp;isbn=9781303938931&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Love and marriage: Domestic relations and matrimonial strategies among the enslaved in the Atlantic world,"""Love and Marriage: Domestic Relations and Matrimonial Strategies Among the Enslaved in the Atlantic World"" argues that the cultural and sociopolitical dimensions of slave marriage were primary issues for diasporic Africans, abolitionists, and proslavery apologists whose lives were intertwined by the cultural and economic connections that framed the Atlantic World throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Through analyzing the interplay between legislation, cultural practice, and political discourse in the early periods of colonial slavery, I first show how matrimonial patterns from Atlantic Africa and Britain were re-imagined by diasporic Africans enslaved in Bermuda, the British West Indies, and colonial North America. Subsequent chapters then illuminate how matrimonial precedents established in these interconnected British territories influenced how both free and enslaved Americans approached the legislative restrictions that characterized slave marriage in the nineteenth-century American South. While past analyses have addressed the social, cultural, and legal dimensions of slave matrimony in specific regions, slave marriage was imbedded within transatlantic discourses that influenced the cultural and political maneuvers of blacks and whites throughout the British Atlantic. Five of my eight chapters specifically concentrate upon the internal dynamics of slave marital relations, and reveal how African-descended peoples reckoned with the circumstances of slavery by creatively re-imagining ancestral marital practices and appropriating foreign customs in Anglophone slave societies. Additionally, I use gender, class, and sexuality as analytical paradigms to explore how the concepts of masculinity, femininity, domesticity, homosociality, social status, and domestic authority were re-imagined by Atlantic Africans and their descendants in the Americas. The remaining three chapters examine how British abolitionism in the early nineteenth century impacted slave legislation and reform in North America up to 1865. As British abolitionists gained public support in the early 1800s their actions spurred the simultaneous developments of a more vociferous North American abolitionist movement, as well as a formidable unit of proslavery apologists. Abolitionists cited the rupture of slaves' domestic relations as the most abhorrent feature of the slave regime, while slavery's apologists cited examples of lavish slave weddings to demonstrate their supposed paternalistic approach toward enslaved laborers. As slave societies crumbled around them, white southerners followed previous examples established by British reformers in proposing that slaves' marital unions be legalized, hoping that this maneuver would promote the system's survival by making it more palatable to both American and international critics. While the reforms were largely ineffective in curtailing the master's authority, the appeal to the marital contract as a remedy for slaves' circumstances is highly suggestive of the subject's importance throughout the nineteenth century. For multiple generations slaves who were ensnared within Anglophone slavery survived multiple events that violated their marital rights, such as the passage from Atlantic Africa to the Americas; Caribbean sugar production; internal slave trades; and the turbulence of warfare. These multifaceted examples plainly reveal the violence done to slaves' domestic relations, and in turn prompt a single, critical question: What does ""marriage"" mean to people who are unable to access a legally-recognized domestic relationship? By grounding my analysis in ex-slave narratives, memoirs, plantation journals, political tracts, and court cases I answer this query by revealing the intricate details of slaves' private lives and how their maneuvers to secure companionship were influential in challenging and overturning the brutal conditions of Atlantic slavery.",1548716360,,Dissertations & Theses," Parry, Tyler D.ParryD.TylerParry, Tyler D.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3385915351 , 89351632 , 66569 , 9781303971716 , 3624156 , 3624156", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303971716, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1548716360?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0506 World History"," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0506 World History"," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0506 World History",," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0506 World History"," African American Studies , Caribbean Studies , World History"," Social sciences , African diaspora , Atlantic world , Jumping the broom , Slave marriage , Slavery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Love+and+marriage%3A+Domestic+relations+and+matrimonial+strategies+among+the+enslaved+in+the+Atlantic+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Parry%2C+Tyler+D.&amp;isbn=9781303971716&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Una sola casa: Salsa consciente and the poetics of the meta-barrio,"The album Siembra (Fania 1978) by Rubén Blades and Willie Colón marked the arrival of Salsa consciente — a strain of New York City Salsa inspired by the global youth revolution of 1968 and the cultural nationalism of the Afro-American Black Panthers and Puerto Rican Young Lords, which gave audible form to Latinidad – the sociopolitical identity of Latinos in the U.S. and beyond. This dissertation analyzes the development of Salsa consciente as a musico-poetic movement that emerged in the mid 1970's and continued as a leading trend at least until 1991. This musical phenomenon expressed the ethnic consciousness of urban immigrants who came to feel that they all lived in una sola casa (one and the same house) or, in the same meta-barrio (urban meta-neighborhood or ghetto), a semiotically constructed abstract meeting space where Latino and Latin Americans interact through the lingua franca of politicized dance music. The style was catalyzed by performers such as Willie Colón, Ray Barretto, Cheo Feliciano, and Eddie Palmieri, following the intellectual lead of composers Rubén Blades and Catalino ""Tite"" Curet Alonso. The term consciente applied to Salsa evokes the idea of class consciousness in the Marxist sense (1971, cf. Lukacs' History and Class Consciousness ) and/or an ethical conscience that rejects consumerist individualism in favor of social solidarity. The artists may have intentionally chosen ambiguity as a means of defying existing political labels. Spread through the media of vinyl records and commercial radio, Salsa consciente was rapidly embraced by communities of various national origins as the socio-musical signature of Latino ethnicity in New York and beyond (cf. Zea, 1986; Padilla 1989; Davila, 2002; Ramirez, 2002; Aparicio, 2003; Caminero-Santangelo, 2007).

Over the past two decades, much attention to warning label design has come from fields such as human factors, ergonomics, and social psychology, but scholarship on abstract visuals in technical communication is not emphasized. Warning labels use generalized abstract bodies to depict the risk of great and potential hazards, demonstrating a removal from physical reality. This paper will look at warning labels through the lens of abstraction. Abstraction is a non-mimetic form of an object or an idea, and its interpretation greatly depends on the context and culture it is observed in. Arnheim's theory of abstraction can help designers create effective designs that communicate cross-culturally based on a system of symbols, signs and pictures. The range of abstraction is evident in hybrid warnings that employ both symbols and pictures. Historical uses of warning labels have been subtly reshaped over the years from highly modernized images to ones that contain symbolic images that aid context and understanding of risk. To analyze the way culture shapes warning images, vending machine warnings were analyzed to understand how context and culture affects the abstraction. A selection of wet floor signs was also analyzed for the cultural influences observed in the abstract representations of human figures. Even though the images are standardized, the international images uncovered links between the designs of the warnings and their current usage that suggested they were influenced by prominent art movements during the 20 th century. While standardization is the surest way to represent ideas across all audiences, the images analyzed in this paper demonstrate that warning label designers can stretch the boundaries of standard designs. Very few of the images remained constant between signs that demonstrate the same warnings, which suggests that viewers are responding well to localized images.",1559198038,,Dissertations & Theses," Jacobsen, Kylie M.JacobsenM.KylieJacobsen, Kylie M.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3420933961 , 90106382 , 66569 , 9781321026191 , 1560295 , 1560295", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321026191, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1559198038?accountid=14496," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0643 Technical Communication , 0681 Rhetoric"," Technical Communication , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Abstraction , Cross-cultural , Design , Human , Risk , Warning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rhetoric+of+warning+labels%3A+Human+figures+in+cross-cultural+design&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jacobsen%2C+Kylie+M.&amp;isbn=9781321026191&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The vicissitudes of democracy: The failure of the left in Pakistan, 1940-1971","The brief but tumultuous story of Pakistan since its creation from the embers of the British Empire in India in1947 is particularly salient in light of the contemporary world affairs. Political histories of Pakistan tend to fall into two distinct camps that are primarily focused on those moments, which seem particularly relevant from the standpoint of contemporaneous events. One strain remains fixated on the rise of the Muslim League particularly in the 1940s, once World War II was immanent, as well as its charismatic spokesman, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, whose constitutionalist vision of a secular Pakistan was formed in opposition to the Gandhi-Nehru-led Indian National Congress. While the other broad stream in the historiographical literature seeks to show that Pakistan is a ""failed"" state—where civil society exists only in an attenuated form. Despite their invaluable insights in diagnosing the state of crisis in Pakistan, such analyses remain aporetic insofar as both tendencies overlook the significance of a wide range of organizations whose activities were politically progressive or ""leftist"" in their orientation, an appreciation of which is necessary for grasping the historical trajectory of modern Pakistan. When historians do attend to the political history of the left, their writings underscore the heavy-handedness of state repression, internecine conflicts within the left, or offer a critique of the Stalinist overtures of the Communist Party of Pakistan. Yet the stress on state coercion or internal fissures is at odds to explain the complete absence of a contemporaneous progressive left; the current historiography is, in other words, unable to distinguish the defeat of the left from the defeatist self-conception of the left. My dissertation project aims to recover the history of progressive politics from the inception of Pakistan in 1947 to the Bangladesh War in 1971. The motivation throughout is to restore to centrality subjects that were once central to social histories—structural change, the state, formal party organizations, capitalist underdevelopment, and the role of historical necessity—as all these refract through the failed democratic legacy in Pakistan. This dissertation addresses this historiographical impasse by mapping out a different approach. That is, rather than accepting the failure of liberal progressive movements in Pakistan, I aim to write a political history on the ""defeat"" of the left; the main object of inquiry is thus the left itself. I conversely ask in the first half of my dissertation to what extent was the decline of the left the result of its failure to transform the nationalist character of the anti-imperialist movement? The failure of the left in Pakistan since the late 1960s, I argue, requires going back to other moments between 1940-71 that were flashpoints for the left, the decisions made at these various junctures complicate the idea that the collapse of the left was due to contingent factors alone. I therefore start by reopening the largely forgotten debates between the Muslim League, the Indian Communist Party, and the Communist Party of Great Britain on the original demand for Pakistan first articulated in 1940. I therefore attempt to show the circuitous route that the left took to support the creation of Pakistan. The second half of the dissertation zeros in on the constitution of the Communist Left in East and West Pakistan, its continuity with the CPI, its self-dissolution in the mid 1950s, and its revival in the 1960s as a distinctly ""New Left,"" which sought to distance itself from the legacy of the ""Old"" or Communist Left. This dissertation was primarily an exercise in fresh archival research that was conducted on a number of visits to Pakistan, at the National Archive in London, the Labour History Archives and Study Center in Manchester, at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, and at the tremendous collections of the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam through a fellowship from the American Institute of Pakistan Studies.",1559962187,,Dissertations & Theses," Khan, AtiyaKhanAtiyaKhan, Atiya", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3422481531 , 87379862 , 66569 , 9781321033441 , 3627843 , 3627843", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321033441, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1559962187?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," Social sciences , Cultural politics , Democracy , Nationalism , Political failre , Politics , Progressive movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+vicissitudes+of+democracy%3A+The+failure+of+the+left+in+Pakistan%2C+1940-1971&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khan%2C+Atiya&amp;isbn=9781321033441&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Therapeutic Communities and the Cultural Politics of Addiction Treatment, 1958-1974","Therapeutic Communities and the Cultural Politics of Addiction Treatment describes how a California commune of ex-heroin addicts refashioned addiction treatment in the early 1960s.

Before Synanon's therapeutic innovation, addiction treatment options were limited to federal penitentiaries and hospital detoxification units; after Synanon, government-supported programs surged.

In the process, I argue that charismatic ex-addict change agents significantly influenced the shifting drug policies that became a pivotal legacy of the 1960s, even as the co-optation of their methods forestalled radical challenges to punitive drug policies after the 1960s ended. This dissertation makes several contributions to historical scholarship. First, historians have largely viewed the political conflict of the ""Long 1960s"" in relation to social movements or the national and global impact of the Vietnam War; far fewer scholars have explored how the seemingly apolitical arena of medicine was influenced by the demands of new interest groups from across the political spectrum. Second, scholars who have analyzed drug cultures of the Sixties have focused on drug use as a symbol of countercultural excess. Medical historians have likewise concentrated on drug use (not treatment) by describing how scientific experts helped construct the concept of addiction and why powerful politicians sought to combat it. As recovering addicts' abstinence-based treatment model ultimately proved compatible with a drug war agenda, this study is among the first to explore the role that addicts and ex-addicts themselves play in historical cycles of punitive and therapeutic addiction policies.",1560897099,,Dissertations & Theses," Clark, Claire D.ClarkD.ClaireClark, Claire D.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3426807921 , 90242992 , 66569 , 9781321148879 , 3634329 , 3634329", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321148879, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1560897099?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0337 American history , 0344 Social research"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0337 American history , 0344 Social research"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0337 American history , 0344 Social research",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0337 American history , 0344 Social research"," Cultural anthropology , American history , Social research"," Social sciences , 1960s , Addiction treatment , California , Counterculture , Drug policy , Heroin , Synanon commune",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Therapeutic+Communities+and+the+Cultural+Politics+of+Addiction+Treatment%2C+1958-1974&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clark%2C+Claire+D.&amp;isbn=9781321148879&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Code-Switching Between Cultures And Languages: &lt;i&gt;Creative &lt;/i&gt; connectivity,"Problem: My thesis addresses individual identity as an interrogation of personal stakes and what constitutes hybrid identification inside competitive notions of authenticity. More specifically, I approach the concept of hybridized identification(s) as in-between zones of code-switching and as a negotiation of spaces continual in their movement between cultures and languages. Such a negotiation results in tensions and/or creative connectivity. Tensions are inherent in any identity construction where the lines that define individuals are not specific to one culture or one language, where notions of pure identity are challenged and communal codes of belonging are jeopardized. Creative connectivity occurs in those instances where code-switching or negotiation of spaces produces open and fluid movement between competing codes of references and differences across color lines, sexuality, culture and language. Issue(s) The notion of hybrid identification is a challenging topic, especially for those who defend the notion of pure cultural identities. It has been a subject of much debate inside literary, political, social, linguistic, communications and even philosophical circles. It is complicated because it shakes the foundation of identity structured inside fixed and inclusive space(s) of cultural and linguistic meaning. For instance, notions of home are not exclusive representations of country of origin or host country. Similarly, notions of race, ethnicity, and sexual spaces are sometimes negatively othered if they fall outside socially accepted and normalized codes. Such codes of meaning are often defined by white heterosexual labels of identification. In today's globalized environment, more than ever, individuals must negotiate who they are inside a sense of self as a movement between local, regional, national, even global models of subjectivity. Approach Thus my thesis explores hybridized subjectivity as a position of tensions and/or creative connectivity between cultures and languages. While I do not wish to simplify the process or issues of self-identification, I believe that hybrid subjectivity is a growing reality in today's globalized arena of cultural bartering. This bartering process is particularly complicated for migrant populations whose desire for belonging in new adopted spaces, their host country, is often in conflict with, or challenged by, desire for past spaces or cultural spaces defined by their country of origin. Thus past references of identification, the base of their core self may not always correspond to, or function harmoniously with, their outer, newer and shifting layers of identification, ones they appropriate from the host country. Because our political, religious, and educational institutions stem from national representations of culture and community, the process of identification and the creation of one's outside self are shaped through an encounter with these institutions. How individuals seek identification between their personal and public spaces thus determines the degree of conflict and or creative connectivity experienced between modes/codes of cultural and linguistic spaces. Therefore identification for migrant populations suggest that ""community and culture will represent both a hybridization of home and host cultures"" (Straubhaar 27).There is much written on hybridity and issues of identity and nation however this thesis focuses on the creative value of code-switching between cultures and languages. What the Literature Will Say Therefore the platform from which I explore my topic of hybridity fluctuates between Homi Bhabha's postcolonial interpretation of hybrid third spaces, Mikhail Bakhtin's model of heteroglossic dialogues, Roland Barthes representation of identity as a transgressive space and Chantal Zabus' understanding of the African palimpsest and code-switching. Then Sherry Simon's model of Montréal's hybrid urban space and Janet Paterson's perceptions of how the Other has shaped and (re)defined literary models of identity in Québec provide a regional and national glimpse of hybridized identification. Finally, Doris Sommer's exploration of bilingualism as an aesthetical, even humorous space of identification situates hybridity as a creative space of connection. Consequence My approach in this thesis does not claim to solve problems that may arise from platforms of hybridized subjectivity. For this reason, I avoid political or nationalistic approaches to identity that refute/discredit, in many instances, hybridized identifications. I also steer away from any in-depth discussion of post-colonial issues. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate how hybridized subjectivity can be a zone of creative connectivity when code-switching offers more intimate exchanges of communication between cultures and languages. It is a creative connectivity because it promotes a more open-minded attitude towards peoples' cultural, linguistic, sexual, even political and religious differences. Hybridized zones of identification allow us to challenge dated traditions, customs, modes of communication and acceptance that imprison people's desire to explore and adopt codes outside standards and models of culture contained within a dominant white discourse of cultural and linguistic belonging.

These rapidly developing technologies allow for new visions of forested landscapes and new forms of social and ecological analysis, and my research investigates both the production of scientific knowledge enabled by remote sensing and GIS, and how this knowledge is used and transformed in application by conservationists. Drawing on over 14 months of field research in Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve — widely recognized as one of the most difficult places in the world to do forest conservation — I analyze how Guatemala's continued history of violence and inequality intersect with technoscience, environmental knowledge, and governance. I present ethnographic accounts of the work of remote monitoring, information processing, and map-making in a joint state-NGO computer lab; the use, interpretation, and transformation of maps and reports by conservationists; and the intersections of this official knowledge with daily lives and livelihoods inside the reserve. I analyze diffractively across these sites and sources, bringing together mundane data processing, images and reports, conservation decisions, local subsistence practices, and both ordinary and exceptional violence. This research reveals the unexpected movements of meaning and politics across scales, the co-construction of official, centralized knowledge with multiple senses of place, space, time, and identity, and the ways in which science and technology are embroiled with deeply felt desires for clarity in a reserve characterized by uncertainty and rapid change. I argue that the violence and political paranoia that characterize post-civil war Guatemala are deeply entangled with the production and interpretation of scientific knowledge about its landscapes and people. Finally, I analyze how this knowledge can facilitate collaboration across social and political difference, while also reinforcing those differences and their embedded power dynamics. This research draws together and contributes to science and technology studies (STS) and environmental anthropology, and also contributes to broad interdisciplinary and applied discussions on the politics of conservation and development practice by examining the dynamics of authority, technology, and knowledge in environmental governance on a troubled landscape.",1564215262,,Dissertations & Theses," Rahder, MichaRahderMichaRahder, Micha", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3439887401 , 87744022 , 66569 , 9781321088373 , 3630744 , 3630744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321088373, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564215262?accountid=14496," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Wildlife Conservation , Cultural anthropology , Environmental Studies , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Conservation , Geographic Information Systems , Guatemala , Mapping , Science studies , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Satellites+and+senses+of+place%3A+Remote+monitoring+of+Guatemala%27s+Maya+Biosphere+Reserve&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rahder%2C+Micha&amp;isbn=9781321088373&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Guardians of the Black Working Class: Labor and Racial Politics in Postwar San Francisco,"“Guardians of the Black Working Class” tells two intersecting stories of postwar urban America. First and foremost, it examines the impact of the “Second Great Migration” on San Francisco and in particular the way in which black labor migrants experienced and transformed the city in the decades following World War II. Second, it provides a different perspective from which to view the “urban crisis” and the fate of postwar liberalism. Contrary to the dominant declension narrative that dominates the historical writing about postwar cities and liberalism, San Francisco seemed to survive the urban crisis comparatively well and represents a place where liberalism remained preeminent in the local political culture. This dissertation argues that black trade unionists, with the support of their unions and especially the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union (ILWU), had a lot to do with this. Arriving in a city with a weak black political and civil rights tradition, a cadre of African-American workers who settled in San Francisco during and shortly after World War II emerged as influential community and civic leaders in the 1950s and 1960s. This study suggests that these black trade unionists, who considered themselves the guardians of the city’s black working class in the postwar period, occupied a unique social, economic, and political niche from which they sought to lead the fight for racial justice and strengthen liberalism in the postwar era. Placing them at the center of the story of civil rights, urban crisis, and liberalism sheds new light on the history of race, class, radicalism, and politics in postwar urban America. This dissertation draws upon a wide range of sources. It uses the archival records of the ILWU and Local 250 of the Transport Workers Union to uncover the activities of black trade unionists within their unions as well as in their communities. Several other manuscript collections, especially the records of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s western region and the mayoral papers of Joseph Alioto, figure prominently in the dissertation’s discussion of local civil rights and political history. These sources are supplemented with an array of government records, hearings, and reports, along with FBI files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The dissertation also draws heavily upon several daily and weekly newspapers, and especially those, such as the Sun-Reporter, published by African Americans. Several oral history interviews, some part of archival and published collections and others conducted by the author, help shed light where the written record is sparse while also enriching the human element to the history that unfolds on these pages. This dissertation is organized into three sections. The first three chapters examine the experiences of black workers who migrated to San Francisco during and immediately after World War II and suggests that the ability of black labor migrants to gain entrance to strong progressive unions was central to the development of black labor, community, and political activism in San Francisco. The presence of the ILWU in particular distinguished the African- American postwar experience in San Francisco from their counterparts in other northern cities – particular those in the Northeast and Midwest. As World War II gave way to the Cold War, white leaders in the ILWU came to view the fate of their union, which had ties to the Communist Party, as intricately bound with that of the city’s new (and rapidly expanding) African American population. It therefore endeavored to establish a mutually beneficial relationship in which African Americans supported the ILWU and the union helped lead the fight against discrimination in employment, housing, and policing. In doing so ILWU leaders groomed a cadre of black trade unionists who could better connect the union to the community. Chapters Four and Five comprise the second section and focus on the relationship between the ILWU, African Americans, and liberalism in San Francisco. Led in part by its African American members, the ILWU forged a strong political alliance with black voters during the 1950s and 1960s. This alliance helped provide each with political muscle, and they translated that strength into palpable political power when they joined forces with Joseph Alioto, a moderate “New Deal” liberal who was elected mayor in 1967. This alliance was significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates how African Americans were able to obtain political influence in a city that lacked a black political tradition and anything resembling a black political leadership class. Second, it highlights the continued role that leftist veterans of the “popular front” era played within liberal politics during the 1960s and 1970s. The ILWU and the city’s black trade unionists sought to push Alioto to the left on certain issues, while Alioto tried deployed them to diffuse racial tensions and help him – with a modicum of success – guide San Francisco through the “urban crisis.” The dissertation’s final section explores the encounter between black trade unionists (along with their liberal political and labor allies) and Black Power. Chapter Six examines an attempt by the Black Panther Party to organize black members of the Transport Workers Union Local 250, which represented the bus, streetcar, and cable car operators in San Francisco. Chapter Seven then describes the efforts of black construction contractors to use liberal reformers’ concerns over community-based Black Power movements as a lever with which to place black entrepreneurs at the center of employment-based affirmative action programs. The failures of both was testament to the strength black-labor-liberal alliance in San Francisco. Although San Francisco’s past does not always conform to the dominant Midwest- Northeast-centered postwar narrative of African American, political, and urban history, it should not be dismissed an exception or an anomaly (as is so often the case). Rather, its distinct and regional characteristics should be considered as variations, alternatives, and contingencies that existed alongside the more well-known histories of its thoroughly-studied counterparts. This dissertation contends that San Francisco can draw our attention to historical developments that might not be as apparent in other places.",1609188858,,Dissertations & Theses," Rosen, John J.RosenJ.JohnRosen, John J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3454988351 , 90824242 , 66569 , 9781321244465 , 3639769 , 3639769", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321244465, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1609188858?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0629 Labor relations"," Black history , American history , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Black panther party , Civil rights , Ilwu , Joseph alioto , Liberalism , National association of minority contractors , National negro labor council , Negro american labor council , San francisco , Twu",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Guardians+of+the+Black+Working+Class%3A+Labor+and+Racial+Politics+in+Postwar+San+Francisco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rosen%2C+John+J.&amp;isbn=9781321244465&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Free Love, Marriage, and Eugenics: Global and Local Debates on Sex, Birth Control, Venereal Disease and Population in 1920s-1930s China","This dissertation traces how eugenics came to underpin discourses pertaining to free love, sex and reproduction in 1920s-1930s China. It shows the eugenic and evolutionist limits to radical or liberal intellectuals' understanding of the role of the individual in the pursuit of sex, free love and birth control. The study examines the scientific view of modernity embodied in eugenics, as well as the challenges to this vision based on humanism and sex aestheticism. Bertrand Russell's visit to China in 1920 with his lover Dora Black led to heated discussions surrounding free love and free divorce, where privacy, the eugenic idea of a ""robust individual"" and science were key. Meanwhile, translations and the reception of Ellen Key and Havelock Ellis's works on eugenics and love underpinned the reconciliation in Chinese liberal intellectuals' thought between individualism/evolutionary humanism and eugenics, particularly in their debates on sexual and emotional ethics in the 1920s. Margaret Sanger's visit to China in 1922 opened up a debate on the suitability of eugenic birth control to solve China's problems, such as overpopulation and venereal disease. By probing into her interactions with Chinese intellectuals in 1922, this study reveals how her eugenic ideas were received, as well as the political tensions regarding her birth control advocacy. The dissertation demonstrates that the sexual reproductive considerations that had been viewed in the 1920s as a problem of the relationship between the individual and nation/race/society, by the 1930s came to completely subordinate the role of the individual to national and racial regeneration concerns. Sanger's continued correspondence with Chinese medical professionals came to shape the birth control movement in the 1930s in more strictly eugenic terms. This research contends that eugenics was not only influential in discourse, but came to be implemented in practice in the fields of sex hygiene, birth control and VD regulation. The agency of pioneer female gynecologists in the 1930s is emphasized by examining how they brought eugenics in practice in their birth control clinics, how they localized global female experience and theories on birth control and hygiene, either through translation or through their attempts to reach working class women with contraceptive sex education. Lastly I argue that eugenics and social hygiene also functioned as a male oriented ideology in VD policies of various colonial powers: British, American, Japanese, and French as part of an economy of empire. By contrast Chinese Nationalist Hygiene Campaigns and female gynecologists' internalizing of eugenics focused on female health.",1615128775,,Dissertations & Theses," David, Mirela VioletaDavidVioletaMirelaDavid, Mirela Violeta", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3468281481 , 87108072 , 66569 , 9781321160864 , 3635118 , 3635118", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321160864, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615128775?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0585 Science history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0332 History , 0585 Science history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0332 History , 0585 Science history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0332 History , 0585 Science history , 0733 Gender studies"," History , Science history , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Birth control , China , Eugenics , Free love , Individualism and ellen key , Sanger, Margaret , Sexuality , Venereal disease",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Free+Love%2C+Marriage%2C+and+Eugenics%3A+Global+and+Local+Debates+on+Sex%2C+Birth+Control%2C+Venereal+Disease+and+Population+in+1920s-1930s+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=David%2C+Mirela+Violeta&amp;isbn=9781321160864&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Monsters of Late Capitalism Along the U.S.-Mexico Border: Legends, Epistemologies, and the Politics of Imagination","My dissertation examines the U.S.-Mexico border during the 20th century, not only as a socio-political space of conflict and struggle, but simultaneously as a 2,000-mile strip of ""haunted"" land, inhabited by many imaginary creatures, fantastic tales, monsters, and popular saints. It is through an examination of government proceedings, archival documents, religious artifacts, interviews, and ethnographic visits to border shrines and festival celebrations, that this research engages with the question of how communities utilize the fantastic and the uncanny to disseminate knowledge and inscribe history. I analyze (a) the myth of the Devil along the border, (b) the Chupacabras, the livestock blood-sucking monster; and (c) the legend of Juan Soldado, a saint of undocumented border crossers. These three entities are used in order to create a genealogy of the effects of capitalism in the region, as each of them correlates to crucial periods of U.S.-Mexico relations. The first chapter begins by studying the legend of El Diablo (the Devil) along the U.S.-Mexico Border, in particular as it is narrated in the novel The Devil in Texas/El Diablo en Texas (1976) by Aristeo Brito. It explores the devil within the context of exploitative capitalism in the region and highlights the interconnection between the events of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the effects of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848), and the emergence of the modern Chicana/o Movement (1960-1970s). The second chapter traces the apparition of El Chupacabras (1994), or goatsucker within the the context of anti-American sentiments in Puerto Rico, the fears and the anxieties of the U.S. post-cold war years, as well as the dismantling of the welfare state. In particular, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers and create a sophisticated polysemic metaphor to illustrate the insatiable appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s. The third chapter continues with the study of Juan Soldado (1930s), one of the saints of undocumented border crossers, within the context of the border transformations created by American Prohibition (1920-1933), the Great Depression (1930s), and the mass ""deportation"" of Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals (1929-1939). This research situates Juan Soldado's conviction for the rape and murder of an eight years old girl, and the subsequent Tijuana riots surrounding this case, as a pivotal event in the long tradition of femicides along the border. This dissertation explores how the battle for survival along the border is performed in the terrains of the fantastic and the uncanny, and where the real and the imaginary are not always clearly defined but deeply shaped by the socio-political and racial tensions of the region. In particular, it analyzes how these legends and popular saints are never random nor naïve, but rather they are sophisticated ""in-context"" social productions assembled and adapted to respond to specific socio-political and racial-economic transnational realities. This project shows how folklore and pop-culture are useful tools to reconstruct the history of violence along the border and to understand the coping mechanisms developed by Latina/o border communities.",1617435746,,Dissertations & Theses," Calvo-Quiros, William A.Calvo-QuirosA.WilliamCalvo-Quiros, William A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3473291451 , 91299952 , 66569 , 9781321201499 , 3637381 , 3637381", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321201499, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617435746?accountid=14496," 0358 Folklore , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0358 Folklore , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0358 Folklore , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0358 Folklore , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Folklore , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Chicano studies , Chupacabras , Folklore studies , Juan soldado , The devil , U.s. - mexico border",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Monsters+of+Late+Capitalism+Along+the+U.S.-Mexico+Border%3A+Legends%2C+Epistemologies%2C+and+the+Politics+of+Imagination&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Calvo-Quiros%2C+William+A.&amp;isbn=9781321201499&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Pacifist Activists: Christian Peacemakers in Palestine 1995-2014,"Inspired by the nonviolence work of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., civilian peacemakers have spent three decades developing third-party nonviolent intervention as a method for preventing the escalation of violence in conflict zones.

The work of this faith-based, non-profit organization is of interest not only in this field, but also to ecumenical scholars and religious leaders exploring interfaith efforts to promote peace and to like-minded nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This dissertation presents a qualitative case study of Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT). This study tests the hypothesis that Christian Peacemaker Teams in the West Bank has effectively developed nonviolent institutions, skills, and training for intervention in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It examines and assesses CPT's organizational model, training, and strategies for intervention in the West Bank including public witness, information politics, and institution-building. Evidence supports the claim that despite its very limited resources, CPT has successfully developed institutions, skills, and training in nonviolent efforts to intervene effectively in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With only four to eight CPTers serving on the Palestine Project at one time, CPT's impact has been extraordinary. One of CPT's most successful endeavors has been its ongoing, nuanced strategy for protective accompaniment in the West Bank. In addition, CPT has been instrumental in the creation of Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions (ICAHD), International Solidarity Movement (ISM), and Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme for Palestine and Israel (EAPPI). CPT has also created a space for Palestinian organizations to develop and operate as exemplified by the South Hebron Hills Popular Committee. CPT's skills and training have served as models for individuals and organizations throughout the West Bank. Although CPT has not approached a large-scale transformation of the violence and injustices within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the organization has transformed the lives of individuals, families, and communities. CPT has saved lives. It has offered moral support to the vulnerable Palestinian community and has taught and modeled for them nonviolence skills. CPT's 20-year effort in the West Bank has contributed to global condemnation of unjust Israeli settlement policies and systematic human rights abuse against a civilian population. CPT has successfully promoted cosmopolitan and communitarian values and cooperation through its interfaith, cross-cultural partnerships. This small group of thoughtful, committed activist pacifists is making a positive difference in Israel/Palestine.",1619354829,,Dissertations & Theses," Leppert-Wahl, Marlaina A.Leppert-WahlA.MarlainaLeppert-Wahl, Marlaina A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3480251251 , 91472412 , 66569 , 9781321234046 , 3639151 , 3639151", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321234046, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1619354829?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0563 Peace Studies"," Religious history , Middle Eastern Studies , Peace Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Nongovernmental organizations , Nonviolent direct action , Palestine , Third-party international accompaniment , West bank",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pacifist+Activists%3A+Christian+Peacemakers+in+Palestine+1995-2014&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leppert-Wahl%2C+Marlaina+A.&amp;isbn=9781321234046&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Language learning perspectives and experiences of stakeholders in the community of Flowers Bay, Roatan, Honduras","When searching for pluralistic models of bilingual education, looking globally for examples is beneficial. The overarching global perspective toward bilingual and multilingual education supports literacy in the student's first, second, and including the possibility of a third or more languages to attain socio-political pluralism. This dissertation project will specifically examine the voices of stakeholders in the local community of Flowers Bay, Roatan, Honduras where the mission of bilingual education is a pluralistic society. The goal of the research study is to examine the perspectives and experiences around language learning within the lens of language as a problem, a right, and a resource of stakeholders in their local community. Chapter I of this dissertation includes the problem statement of the research project, a historical and contextual explanation of the land, people, and social movement toward multilingual education on the Bay Islands of Honduras. Chapter II is a review of the literature surrounding the two frameworks in the research project. The first framework I utilize is the public sphere to describe who is or is not included in the conversations of multilingual education within the community of Flowers Bay, Roatan, Honduras. The second framework I utilize is language as a problem, a right, and a resource to describe and analyze the data collected from national policies, field observations, and stakeholders. Chapter III is an in-depth description of the research design, the demographics of the stakeholders in Flowers Bay, the method data collected and analysis of the data. Chapter IV features the findings from the data analysis using the two frameworks outlined in Chapter II. Chapter V offers a discussion of the frameworks and further research projects inspired by this dissertation project. Three themes emerged from framework of language as a right and resource of stakeholder voices from Flowers Bay, Roatan, Honduras: access, economy, and identity. Two themes emerged from the stakeholder voices not represented in the frameworks: resources needed and parent engagement.",1619367497,,Dissertations & Theses," McNelly, Carla A.McNellyA.CarlaMcNelly, Carla A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3480383251 , 91476712 , 66569 , 9781321254822 , 3640210 , 3640210", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321254822, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1619367497?accountid=14496," 0282 Bilingual education , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy",," 0282 Bilingual education , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy"," Bilingual education , Multicultural Education , Education Policy"," Education , Honduras , Pluralistic society , Public school education , Strong bilingual education programs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Language+learning+perspectives+and+experiences+of+stakeholders+in+the+community+of+Flowers+Bay%2C+Roatan%2C+Honduras&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McNelly%2C+Carla+A.&amp;isbn=9781321254822&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Lawyering Against Apartheid: The Southern Africa Project of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, 1967-1994","Between 1967 and 1994, the Southern Africa Project of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law connected lawyers in southern Africa and the United States to provide funding, resources, and solidarity. The Project, as it became known, existed as a subsidiary of the larger Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington, DC,-based organization formed in 1963 for the purpose of furthering civil rights law in the United States. The Southern Africa Project served as a major funder in southern African political trials, funneling money from donors such as the Ford Foundation, Lutheran World Federation, South African Council of Churches, United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa, and World Council of Churches. Additionally, it provided expert witnesses and pathologists for death in detention cases. The Southern Africa Project provided an important link between solidarity workers in southern Africa and the United States as it transmitted information about detainees and political martyrs and assisted in public, US-based demonstrations against apartheid. This dissertation argues that the Southern Africa Project's work was instrumental to political and legal change in Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa and aims to situate it within the literature on freedom struggles on both sides of the Atlantic. While many organizations provided solidarity and funding, the Project played a unique role in connecting lawyers in southern Africa and the United States. Additionally, it assisted with constitutional research during negotiations on South Africa's future, and it helped facilitate and monitor elections in both Namibia and South Africa. The organization led US and international delegations participating in these elections and became one of the key non-South African actors during the transition. Utilizing archival research, interviews, and media coverage of the organization, Lawyering Against Apartheid traces the organizational history of the Southern Africa Project, contextualizing its 1967 founding and discussing its major initiatives and successes. Research for this particular project has taken place in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has utilized archival sources as well as interviews with Project workers, clients, and colleagues. This dissertation does not present—or even attempt to—a comprehensive view of the organization's many trials, but it does argue for its importance in a few key ones such as the Trial of the Namibians, the Steve Biko Inquest, Neil Aggett Inquest, State v. Ramaligela , and the Cassinga Detaines trial in Namibia. It follows a chronological structure, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1990s and transition period. A brief conclusion attempts to place the Project into a larger historical context. Lawyering Against Apartheid contributes to literature on social change generally, as well as to discussions of change in both southern Africa and the United States. It attempts to insert the Southern Africa Project into discussions about the larger Worldwide Anti-Apartheid Movement and to demonstrate the organization's role in important political trials. Through its discussion on law and social change, as well as its contribution to liberation struggle history, it hopes to provide a springboard for future scholars interested in any of these issues or in the organization and its cases.",1620907275,,Dissertations & Theses," Houser, Myra AnnHouserAnnMyraHouser, Myra Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3484441301 , 91565492 , 66569 , 9781321281941 , 3641745 , 3641745", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321281941, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1620907275?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies"," 0323 American studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies"," 0323 American studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies",," 0323 American studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0616 International law , 0654 South African Studies"," American studies , African history , American history , International law , South African Studies"," Social sciences , Civil rights , Human rights , Lawyering , Namibia , South africa , United states",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lawyering+Against+Apartheid%3A+The+Southern+Africa+Project+of+the+Lawyers%27+Committee+for+Civil+Rights+Under+Law%2C+1967-1994&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Houser%2C+Myra+Ann&amp;isbn=9781321281941&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Piratical Designations: Power and Possibility in Representations of Piracy,"This dissertation analyzes how designations and representations of piracy define, police, and challenge legitimate production and circulation. From antiquity through the present, the labeling of others as pirates has excluded the less powerful from the authorized distribution of tangible and intangible property. Such discursive exclusion not only defines piracy but also creates it, distinguishing it from other, sanctioned forms of appropriation. This exclusion generates political, legal, and cultural subjectivity, thereby allowing so-called pirates to affect the very discourses and processes from which they are excluded. The first chapter traces the term piracy from its linguistic origin in Ancient Greece to its extension to literary property in 17 th century and its current use as a rhetorical weapon in the global information society. Isolating five necessary conditions, this chapter reads piracy across its maritime, intellectual, and digital manifestations, elucidating the success and failure of designations of piracy. The second chapter focuses on the destabilization of these conditions in Hollywood's representations of Caribbean piracy. Due to gaps in the historical record, historians have conflictingly interpreted Golden Age (1650-1720) pirates as criminals, rebels, and anarcho-libertarians. Following these interpretations, but adapting them to its own institutional and hegemonic needs, Hollywood has developed three types of pirates: an actively piratical villain, a reluctantly piratical hero, and a gender shifting temporary pirate. The third chapter develops a genealogy of the anti-piracy media and educational campaigns of the film and recording industries, locating in the 1980's ""Home Taping is Killing Music"" campaign the appeals that have dominated later campaigns. Recreating the reception of the campaigns of the early 2000's, this chapter combines humanities scholarship on copyright industry rhetoric with social science research on the efficacy of the campaigns to understand why these campaigns have failed to affect the copying norms and practices of millennials. The final chapter analyzes the history and interventions of the groups leading the Swedish Pirate Movement, examining how the Piratbyrån, The Pirate Bay, the Missionerande Kopimistsamfundet, and the Piratpartiet humorously appropriate the labels and rhetoric of copyright industry representatives to define themselves and challenge anti-piracy campaigns and legislation.",1622145488,,Dissertations & Theses," High, MichaelHighMichaelHigh, Michael", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3490384971 , 91641592 , 66569 , 9781321301625 , 3642964 , 3642964", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321301625, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1622145488?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0459 Communication , 0900 Film studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0459 Communication , 0900 Film studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0459 Communication , 0900 Film studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0459 Communication , 0900 Film studies"," Comparative literature , Communication , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Hollywood , MPAA , Piracy , Piratebyran , Pirates , RIAA",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Piratical+Designations%3A+Power+and+Possibility+in+Representations+of+Piracy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=High%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=9781321301625&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Environmental Injustice in Washington, D.C.: The Influence of the United States Political Economy on Distributive, Participatory and Procedural Aspects of Justice From 1914 to 2000","Despite the federal attention environmental justice has received in the last few decades, community environmental hazards persist—even in the nation's capital. The purpose of this study was to explore the socio-historical development of environmental hazards in Washington, D.C. to understand how the United States political economy, municipal policies, local practices and community agency shaped hazardous sites in economic and policy periods from 1914 through 2000. This was completed through the analysis of three components of justice—distributive, participatory, and procedural. Thus, the following research questions were used to direct this study: (1) How were environmental hazards distributed in Washington, D.C. from 1914 to 1945? (2) How did community members demonstrate collective agency at Kenilworth Park and Spring Valley? (3) What response and recovery actions did federal government perform at each study site? Central theoretical concepts of historical materialism guided this study as it explored how the laws of capitalism and the forces national and political economy of the United States manifested themselves in forms specific to the U.S. as well as particular to the capital region. The study used historical materialist theory to provide insight into the development of environmental hazards in Washington, D.C. and their relationship to the greater U.S. political economy across three economic periods and four separate policy periods from 1914 to 2000. The economic periods center on shifts in the U.S. economy related to production: World Wars I and II and the Great Depression (1914 to 1945), post war expansion and automation (1945 to 1979), and global capitalism in the electronic age (1980 to 2000). The four policy periods included in these economic periods (1914-1945; 1945-1969; 1970-1979; 1980-2000) were identified by policy development and erosion as well as factors that influenced policymaking such as popular movements. There was an emphasis on U.S. armed conflict and arms-making, as the relationship between these topics and environmental hazards is often neglected in environmental justice literature. A qualitative, case study approach was used to detail how environmental hazards were distributed and remediated in Washington, D.C. over the economic and policy periods. The methodological approach was dialectical and connected each study site to a historical context while examining socio-historical changes and shifts. The study involved the secondary analysis of information from multiple sources in public archives—newspaper articles, books, local and federal government agency records, photographs, and maps—to detail the development of each site as it occurred within its historical context as well as within the greater, structural framework of the nation. For the analysis of hazard distribution, patterns of alienation from nature and the spatialization of race surfaced. Findings regarding community response to hazards highlighted how community stakeholder interests may conflict and change over time, how social classes distinctly respond to their environmental hazards, and how tragedies work to prompt political action and social change. Finally, the analysis of data related to federal and local government response yielded numerous instances of patterns of elite mobilization to shape knowledge. These knowledge-shaping tactics intended to influence public opinion were: information suppression, contestation of knowledge, and the production of knowledge. Overall, research discovered injustices related to race and class; however, data demonstrated that regardless of community characteristics, protecting the interests of the corporate and political elite was paramount. Capitalist imperatives such as the maximization of profit were pursued at all costs, even the health and welfare of people, animals and the environment.",1625052570,,Dissertations & Theses," Turner, Milanika S.TurnerS.MilanikaTurner, Milanika S.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3495777061 , 91760972 , 66569 , 9781321282245 , 3641765 , 3641765", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321282245, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1625052570?accountid=14496," 0470 Environmental Health , 0615 Political science , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy"," 0470 Environmental Health , 0615 Political science , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy"," 0470 Environmental Health , 0615 Political science , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy",," 0470 Environmental Health , 0615 Political science , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy"," Environmental Health , Political science , Environmental Justice , Public policy"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Environmental equality , Environmental hazards , Environmental inequality , Environmental injustice , Environmental racism , Superfunds",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Environmental+Injustice+in+Washington%2C+D.C.%3A+The+Influence+of+the+United+States+Political+Economy+on+Distributive%2C+Participatory+and+Procedural+Aspects+of+Justice+From+1914+to+2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turner%2C+Milanika+S.&amp;isbn=9781321282245&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Bâzgasht-i Adabî (Literary Return) and Persianate Literary Culture in Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Iran, India, and Afghanistan","The idea that some poets in eighteenth and nineteenth century Iran revived Persian poetry by returning to the styles of the classical masters, while poets outside of Iran did not, has left a deep impression on how Persian literary history has come to be written. This idea, known as bâzgasht-i adabî (literary return), has left much historiographical debris in its wake: the conflation of the writing of Persian literary history with that of Iran's own; the assertion of a greater proprietary right by Iran over the great ""masters""; and the erasure from history of many facets of Persian literary culture occurring outside of Iran's borders. As influential as this concept has been, its impact has not been challenged sufficiently. This is equally true for how the idea of bâzgasht-i adabî developed and shaped the writing of both Iranian and Persian literary history, as it is for understanding the activities of Iranian poets who sought a ""return"" to the masters. This dissertation addresses this gap by revisiting the concept of bâzgasht-i adabî and the larger realm of Persianate literary culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Crucial to this endeavor is recognizing that bâzgasht-i adabî is an idea, movement, and category exclusively pertaining to Iran. Its inclusion within the narrative of Persian literary history signifies a special literary path for Iran, as distinct from other locales in the Persianate world. Those places, not subjected to a revival of the masters' styles, supposedly remained stagnant and therefore unimportant to the development of Persian literary culture. Thus bâzgasht-i adabî is an interjection in Persian literary history that at once revitalizes literature in Iran while effectively dismissing aspects of Persian literary history occurring outside of Iran. This omission is all the more glaring because the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a vital and transformative period in the Persianate world, not just in Iran, but in other places as well. This work addresses the immense historiographical impact of bâzgasht-i adabî , and also the historiographies of Persian literary culture in eighteenth and nineteenth century India and Afghanistan. Analyzing the historiographies of Iran, India, and Afghanistan together provides a more integrated approach to Persian literary trends, a necessary corrective in the context of an era of global change. A wide-angle comparative approach offers the benefits of situating bâzgasht-i adabî —as a conceptual category and historical movement—in a larger geographical and chronological framework. This approach enables a fuller understanding of the shifting literary-cultural landscape in the Persianate world during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Following a historiographical appraisal of Persian literary culture in Iran, India, and Afghanistan during these two centuries (Chapter One), this work focuses on three specific literary environments, one in each of these locales. Chapter Two examines the Isfahânî Circle of poets that sought to ""return"" Persian poetry to the styles of the masters and argues for a re-evaluation of their aims and aspirations. Chapter Three focuses on the Persian literary activity at the court of the last Nawâb of Arcot (a ruler of a Mughal successor state in South India) and highlights how local poetic debates remained connected to similar issues vexing the larger nineteenth century Persianate world. Chapter Four explores a series of jangnâmah s (battle-poems) of the first Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842), composed in imitation of Firdawsî's Shâhnâmah, and demonstrates how the circulation of these texts created a robust ""marketplace of the masters"" stretching across Afghanistan and South Asia, in both oral and print forms. All four chapters are based on a wide range of original source material in Persian, especially poetry and works of the tazkirah (biographical anthology) genre. Chapters Two through Four each convey their own stories and geographically bound social and literary histories. Often these topics appear best understood as firmly grounded in events of a local nature and more relevant to the writing of Iran, Indian, or Afghan literary history. At the same time, they document a larger Persianate environment best characterized as a shared engagement with the work, ideas, and personas of the ""masters"" of Persian poetry. The Isfahânî Circle of poets in Iran, the court of the last Nawâb of Arcot, and the Afghan jangnâmah s, are instances of how various individuals in different locales looked toward the poetry and prestige of the masters and engaged with them at a time when the Persianate world was breaking apart. Their occurrence demands a reappraisal of the exclusivity of the idea of bâzgasht-i adabî as applicable only to Iran. With an expanded definition of bâzgasht-i ababî , one that encompasses other engagements with the ""masters"" outside Iran, we are able to rethink the categories used in the writing of Persian literary history and to confront the need to write a more integrative account.",1627787840,,Dissertations & Theses," Schwartz, Kevin LewisSchwartzLewisKevinSchwartz, Kevin Lewis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3507002591 , 91475402 , 66569 , 9781321260991 , 3640633 , 3640633", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321260991, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1627787840?accountid=14496," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0559 Near Eastern Studies"," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0559 Near Eastern Studies"," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0559 Near Eastern Studies",," 0315 Middle Eastern literature , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0559 Near Eastern Studies"," Middle Eastern literature , Middle Eastern history , Near Eastern Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Afghanistan , Eighteenth century , Historiography , Iran , Nineteenth century , Persian culture , Persian history , Persian literature , South asia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=B%C3%A2zgasht-i+Adab%C3%AE+%28Literary+Return%29+and+Persianate+Literary+Culture+in+Eighteenth+and+Nineteenth+Century+Iran%2C+India%2C+and+Afghanistan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schwartz%2C+Kevin+Lewis&amp;isbn=9781321260991&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Elite capture and forest governance in India,"Elite capture is a persistent problem in forest governance. Influential and powerful elites often capture a major portion of forest-based benefits due to their well-entrenched structural domination of forest governance. The problem is chronic and many scholars have held it responsible for the continuous failure of the state efforts to manage forests equitably and sustainably. They have blamed it for inequitable outcomes. The representation of the state as an incapable entity in countering the elite domination has encouraged various actors to promote the alternative institutional arrangements. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is one of such initiatives that call for an active involvement of communities in forest governance through arrangements that do not include only government. CBNRM has been implemented in many countries through decentralization reforms mostly driven by international donors, non-governmental organizations, fiscal compulsions of central governments and the demands of the civil society and social movements. CBNRM is considered as an antidote to the persistent problem of elite capture. By empowering communities to make plans, and implement them, CBNRM aims at tackling the influence and the domination of the elites over the decision-making processes. However, the evidence does not support this contention. Many studies have shown that CBNRM is highly prone to elite capture. Overwhelming evidence from several studies have shown that CBNRM ignores issues of power relations favoring elites. The poor fail to participate effectively in the participatory programs due to structural barriers and, therefore, fail to shape the decisions on forest resources on which their own livelihoods depend. CBNRM has largely failed in breaking the tight inter-locking and multifaceted control of the elites over forest-related decisions. The continuous failure of forest governance to tackle elite capture motivates the question: “What governance mechanisms reduce the probability of elite capture in forest management to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes?” Drawing on the literature from political science, political ecology, policy sciences and natural resource governance literature to conclude, elite capture is reduced when (i) state or external interventions adopt a pro-poor targeted approach, and (ii) autonomous counter power has emerged in the form of individuals or groups that constantly challenge the institutionalized authority of elites. A mixed method approach - both qualitative as well as quantitative - provides a deeper understanding of the processes involved in elite capture generalizes to large set of cases. This dissertation is based on the analysis of (i) comparative case studies of elite capture in three local governments under decentralized forest management (ii) a dataset of 38 local governments over 7 years on the distribution of timber for house construction and repair from public forests, and (iii) state regulation of felling of trees on private lands that includes market transactions between 11,005 farmers and 215 market traders in 573 villages in Northern India. This analysis shows that only where pro-poor state or external interventions create conditions for autonomous counter power to emerge, has the hold of elites over forest governance been reduced. The counter power emerges when certain prerequisite conditions are present. These include the presence of affirmative action from external interventions, the creation of institutionalized space for collective action, and the existence of clear property rights over common-pool resources. The autonomous counter power acts as an external mechanism to ensure accountability of local resource governance. Foresters should, therefore, engage with the existing corridors of powers on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged sections to make existing forest governance equitable and sustainable.",1642406795,,Dissertations & Theses," Rana, PushpendraRanaPushpendraRana, Pushpendra", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3546756511 , 92623052 , 66569 , 9781321366181 , 3646610 , 3646610", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321366181, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1642406795?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0366 Geography , 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Geography , Natural Resource Management , Political science , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Autonomous counter power , Decentralization , Elite capture , Forest governance , India , Natural resource management , Neaest neighbor matching , Spatial econometrics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Elite+capture+and+forest+governance+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rana%2C+Pushpendra&amp;isbn=9781321366181&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Conservation and Development in Chilean Patagonia: Assessing Value Orientations, Cultural Truths, and Rural Change in the Context of Public and Private Protected Areas","This dissertation explores the nexus of protected area (PA) conservation and development in southern Chile. In a three-manuscript format and employing an array of methodological approaches (e.g., principal component analysis, ethnography, personal interviews, surveys, thematic analysis, and cultural consensus analysis), I explored the relevance of value orientations (VOs), utility of cultural consensus analysis, and impacts of private development-based conservation on human wellbeing (HWB). The aim is to show how protected area conservation-development agendas can more fully articulate with peoples’ culturally specific worldviews in Latin America. Chapter 2: Debates about PA wildlife conservation often occur because stakeholders hold divergent VOs. This exploratory study examined differences in the socio-demographic characteristics and policy preferences of Strong Protection and Mixed Protection-Use VO groups in Tamango National Reserve (TNR), Chile. TNR visitors (N = 97) were interviewed during the Chilean summer of 2012. I grouped respondents into Strong Protection (63%) and Mixed Protection-Use (37%) VO subgroups using K-means cluster analysis. Respondents in the mixed groups included residents and non-residents, were more likely to be male, and were less supportive of several huemul ( hippocamelus bisulcus ) conservation policies than respondents in the Strong group. These findings can help the TNR administration devise appropriate responses to tourism, husbandry, and hydroelectric energy production in the region grounded in local perspectives and context. Chapter 3: Large-scale privately owned protected areas (PPAs) in the biodiversity-rich Los Ríos region in southern Chile have generated controversy over their effects on the development pathways open to local residents. This study employed cultural consensus analysis (CCA) and compared PPA conservation officer (CO) and community members’ cultural models of private development-based conservation. A cultural consensus survey was administered between May and August 2013 near the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (RCV) and Huilo Huilo Reserve (HH). Analysis confirms a monolithic CO culture exists for COs and that differences between COs in RCV and HH community members exist. Gaps in communication, inequitable decision making, differences about livelihood impacts and trajectories, and PPA purpose may explain variability in responses, while variability in response between and within communities appear historically contingent. We conclude CCA can help PPA administrations improve their community interactions and refine or replace underperforming authoritative conservation and development models to better achieve conservation and development goals. Chapter 4: As part of the so-called global green-grab movement, PPAs are expanding rapidly in less industrialized nations, transforming geographic borders, influencing politics and economies, and creating socio-political tensions within neighboring communities. This work explored how PPAs impact human wellbeing (HWB) using three case studies in Los Ríos, Chile where three large-scale PPAs were engaging in-situ forest protection. Results from semi-structured interviews suggest residents perceived PPA ownership type affected security and empowerment, while degree of interaction impacted opportunities. These results help establish large-scale private conservation as a social and political process by adhering to principles of “good” governance and chronicling how the green-grabs impact HWB..",1643246385,,Dissertations & Theses," Serenari, ChristopherSerenariChristopherSerenari, Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3551080151 , 93125922 , 66569 , 9781321414387 , 3647688 , 3647688", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321414387, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1643246385?accountid=14496," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Natural Resource Management , Latin American Studies , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Chile , Cultural consensus , Patagonia , Protected areas , Value orientations , Wellbeing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conservation+and+Development+in+Chilean+Patagonia%3A+Assessing+Value+Orientations%2C+Cultural+Truths%2C+and+Rural+Change+in+the+Context+of+Public+and+Private+Protected+Areas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Serenari%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781321414387&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Libertarian Ethic and the Spirit of Global Capital: Post-Industrial Spirituality of the American Workplace,"In recent decades, the business world has demonstrated an elevated interest in the role that ""spirituality"" might play in the workplace. Corporate executives, researchers in fields such as management and organizational behavior, and popular authors suggest that recognizing the ""spiritual"" dimensions of work can not only have a positive effect on employee morale, but simultaneously elevate productivity as well as bottom-line profits. Although scholars of religion have asserted a number reasons for this trend, their explanations prove myopic. I contend that ""workplace spirituality,"" as it has been dubbed, is neither a coherent religious movement in its own right, nor is it merely the extension of the church into business, as others have suggested. Instead, my analysis, which employs ethnography as well as social history, reveals something more basic has changed over the last half century in the way Americans think and behave towards work, and these changes remain inextricably bound to large-scale socio-economic trends over the latter half of the twenty-first century. It is part of a shift from a national economy defined by heavy industry, to a globalized one driven by high technology, finance, and mass consumption. New forms of work that depend greatly on interpersonal skills and emotional labor have risen to the fore. Amidst these new forms of work, I argue, some Americans have turned to rhetorics of spirituality to understand the role of work in their lives, in the society, and in the world. This dissertation, however, pushes the discussion further, to elucidate the political dimensions of workplace spirituality. Neoliberalism, a range of pro-business attitudes that seeks to minimize government intervention into the economy, is an integral and underappreciated component of workplace spirituality. The rhetoric of spirituality at work embraces the ""spirit"" of global capitalism; it celebrates the power of business, operating under the auspices of deregulated markets, to advance human material and spiritual progress. Moreover, it instills within its practitioners a libertarian ethos that valorizes personal responsibility and affords individuals with a sense of power and significance in a world shaped less by nation-states and increasingly dominated by the dynamics of a global marketplace.",1649242722,,Dissertations & Theses," LoRusso, James DennisLoRussoDennisJamesLoRusso, James Dennis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3574300391 , 93683842 , 66569 , 9781321375800 , 3665277 , 3665277", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321375800, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1649242722?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0618 Comparative , 0626 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0618 Comparative , 0626 Sociology"," 0337 American history , 0618 Comparative , 0626 Sociology",," 0337 American history , 0618 Comparative , 0626 Sociology"," American history , Comparative , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Cafe gratitude , Conscious capitalism , Globalization , Libertarianism , Neoliberal habitus , Neoliberal religion , Post-industrial society , Seeker spirituality , Willis harman , Workplace spirituality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Libertarian+Ethic+and+the+Spirit+of+Global+Capital%3A+Post-Industrial+Spirituality+of+the+American+Workplace&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=LoRusso%2C+James+Dennis&amp;isbn=9781321375800&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""When Life Happens"": Theatres of HIV and Complexity in South Africa","This dissertation examines theatre as part of an artistic movement in South Africa to address the social, structural, and emotional repercussions of HIV, as well as a space in which knowledge about HIV/AIDS is actively created, mediated, reproduced, challenged, and presented for public consumption. I focus on innovation in recent theatrical practices that have occurred as artists and members of broader civil society struggle to understand the trajectory of the country's AIDS epidemic and question the scope of popular national HIV intervention campaigns. I use emerging forms of cultural production as a lens through which to interrogate knowledge production and representation about HIV/AIDS, illness, and sexuality in the post-apartheid era; the effects of HIV/AIDS within communities and in individual people's lived experience; and the creative responses front-line health workers develop to mediate between global public health agendas and the particularities of local health needs. I follow the lives of 81 urban theatre-makers across 20 different artistic groups at mainstream, community, university, and non-governmental organization levels. I focus on the lived experiences of six theatre groups and four independent, experimental theatre-makers as a representative cross-section of the artists with whom I worked. My research extends the domain of medical anthropology beyond conventional health settings to include analysis of how artistic technologies lend themselves to HIV/AIDS communication and intervention practices. In particular, I identify and explore certain artistic technologies that are engaged by theatre-makers to rework definitions of health, illness, reflexivity, and activism for the contemporary moment. Principally, I analyze the kinds of language and optics theatre-makers are starting to incorporate into their intervention work on HIV/AIDS and how these changes reflect broader shifts in their ideas about the possibilities for health programming in the second decade after democratization. I argue that theatre-makers are actively challenging the scope and techniques of reflexivity implicit in dominant public health models for HIV intervention. While common global public health attention to HIV/AIDS often privileges focus on biomedical facts or analysis of underlying structural factors that contribute to health inequalities, many artists in the country have recently begun interrogating what they call ""life's complexities"": the hard-to-explain parts of human lives that emerge, not fully rationally understood by the people experiencing them, during times of economic, social, political, environmental, and biological disruption or from contradictions in life. I analyze how, why, and in reaction to what political pressures theatre-makers have begun acknowledging this kind of complexity within interventions related to HIV. In addition, I present ethnographic data for a grounded analysis of what complexity means to the people with whom I worked. I then take those local understandings as a basis for theorizing. I argue that theatre-makers are using the focus on ""complexity"" as a point of entry to produce expanded forms of reflexivity meant to handle or engage with the kinds of existential concerns that emerge during lived experience of systemic structural inequality, marginality, violence, illness, and vulnerability. I suggest theatre-makers are positioning these new ideas about reflexivity as a form of health activism for the post-apartheid era and subtly but significantly recasting the individual/community dichotomy implicit in many global public health outreach programs by challenging neoliberal conceptions of the responsible health citizen. Through these shifts, I argue that theatre-makers are actively developing and promoting an alternative form of health subjectivity based on critical reflexivity around the relationships between self, society, structure, and agency. A final goal of this project was to provide an anthropological critique of theatre as an institution within the broader healthcare industry of South Africa. I investigate how power and oppression articulate within the artistic sector and contribute to differences between how theatre-makers talk about the style and content of their work and what kinds of health theatre are implemented in practice. Examining both what is said and what is done illuminates the tensions health workers face on the ground in mediating between ideological convictions and the structural constraints that often heavily influence applied practice. I analyze what kinds of power are involved in the health theatre sector's interactions with other institutions in the country, as well as what kinds of creativity are enacted when theatre-makers attempt to negotiate the competing interests of involved stakeholders and work at the interstices of disciplinary boundaries. I explicate the kinds of institutional power and influence that shape the context in which knowledge about HIV/AIDS is produced within the arts, how theatre-makers experience these contexts, and what strategies artists implement when they begin to engage with institutional power structures. In addition, I argue that theatre-makers have begun deploying certain ideologies and discursive topics as a bid to gain cultural capital, structural power, and material resources within the broader HIV/AIDS intervention industry.

The disorders of movement and posture are characterised by abnormal patterns of movement related to defective movement coordination and regulation of muscle tone. Secondary problems that may develop include perceptions of fatigue and pain. Difficulties with body function and structure affect the levels of activity and participation of the person, such as functional independence, walking ability and participation in leisure activities. These multiple facets of functioning contribute to the known physical inactivity problem apparent in youth with cerebral palsy. In addition, these low physical activity levels contribute to further deterioration of functioning. Hence, a vicious cycle of deconditioning exists. A community-based swimming programme was proposed to combat this vicious cycle. A systematic review on the effect of an aquatic intervention on the multiple facets of functioning of youth with cerebral palsy revealed no studies that measured the effect on pain, coordination and quality of life. Moreover, none of the authors reported the perceived enjoyment of the participants during the intervention. Furthermore, there was a lack of controlled studies reporting the effect of a swimming intervention on walking ability, fatigue, functional independence, self-perception, participation in leisure activities and aquatic skills in ambulatory youth with cerebral palsy. Consequently, the aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of swimming on these multiple facets of functioning that are associated with the low physical activity levels, in youth with cerebral palsy. A randomised controlled cross-over design was implemented to investigate the effect of a 10-week swimming intervention on pain intensity, fatigue, walking ability, bilateral and upper limb coordination, functional independence, perceived competence, global self-worth, quality of life and swimming skills. A pre-test – post-test design was used to assess the effect of taking part in a swimming programme on participation in leisure activities. Fourteen 7 to 17 year-old youth with cerebral palsy with the ability to walk with or without walking aids completed the tests on all measurement occasions. All youth had a high adherence towards the programme, participated in the intervention with high levels of enjoyment, and most youth continued to participate in swimming after completing the programme. Moreover, no adverse events due to the programme were reported and no participants withdrew from the intervention. Swimming skills improved significantly over the 10-week swimming programme, and improved significantly more than over the control period. The changes were retained throughout a 20-week follow-up period. Positive trends of improvement were evident for walking distance at maximum walking speed, upper limb coordination, functional independence in social functioning and mobility, and perceived motor competence. The intervention was not associated with increases of pain and fatigue. Participation in the swimming programme did not affect bilateral coordination, functional independence in self-care, self-perception and quality of life. The evidence of the pre-test – post-test study suggests that learning the skill of swimming encouraged participation in activities of the formal domain, active-physical and skill-based activities, and facilitated youth to engage in aquatic activities. No control data were obtained in the pre-test – post-test study; however, the results are promising in view of the known deterioration in participation with increasing age. Additionally, the present study showed that the perceptions of youth with cerebral palsy that learning a new skill is too time consuming, and that physical activity is not fun and carries a risk of injury, pain and fatigue, were eliminated in the swimming program. The consolidation of swimming skills and high levels of enjoyment during the programme, are expected to improve participation, engagement and adherence to physical activity, which was confirmed in the present study as youth participated more in aquatic activities after one year than before the start of the study. It was concluded that swimming is an enjoyable and safe community-based physical activity that may have a positive effect on the physical, social and emotional well-being in 7 to 17 year-old youth with cerebral palsy with the ability to walk. The elimination of some of the barriers confronted by youth with cerebral palsy to engaging in physical activity is important with regard to the sustainment of a physically active lifestyle. The findings suggest that participation in swimming may aid in breaking the cycle of deconditioning.",1654747799,,Dissertations & Theses," Declerck, Marlies Hilde PhilipDeclerckHilde PhilipMarliesDeclerck, Marlies Hilde Philip", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3588370391 , 94017002 , 101309 , U622012 , U622012 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1654747799?accountid=14496, 0523 Physical education, 0523 Physical education, 0523 Physical education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0523 Physical education, Physical education," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9459 , (UMI)AAIU622012 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Swimming+and+the+physical%2C+social+and+emotional+well-being+of+youth+with+cerebral+palsy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Declerck%2C+Marlies+Hilde+Philip&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conspiradoras in the contact zone: escritoras chicanas y su obra en espanol hacia una literatura menor,"This thesis deals with narrative and discursive resources found in the works of five Chicana writers who write in Spanish in the eighties: Lucha Corpi, Gina Valdes, Miriam Bornstein, Erlinda Gonzales-Berry and Margarita Cota-Cárdenas. This study analyzes some literary devices that link the production of these five Chicana writers with minor literature and the concept of contact zone; furthermore this project studies how these writers create a transcultural and transnational literature. This study will argue that these five Chicana writers are ""conspirators in contact zones"" and their literary works have been regarded as minor literature. Deleuze and Guattari define a minor literature through three main characteristics; firstly the deterritorialization of language, secondly the political element, and finally, the collective value. The writers discussed in this thesis are configured as conspirators because they fight against the dominant discourses creating other possible narratives that demonstrate the process of exclusion and discrimination that they have endored as Chicana women writing in Spanish in the US. My work also shows how by writing in Spanish, this group of Chicana writers open spaces from where is it possible to resist to a dominant discourse and deconstruct hegemonic form. In addition, this study shows how these writers act as conspirators in an area that Mary Louise Pratt calls ""contact zone,"" a space ""where disparate cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in highly asymmetrical relations of domination and subordination: such as colonialism, or are their aftermaths as they lived out across the globe today"" (Imperial Eyes 7). Following the idea of ""contact zone,"" it's clear that the Chicana writers I analyzed have lived in these spaces, for different reasons, and have experienced culture shock and relations of domination and subordination. As a result of these experiences, their works can be defined as transcultural. In these works we find to a greater or lesser extent, what according to Pratt contain cultural productions that occur in the contact zones: ""Autoethnography, transculturation, critique, collaboration, bilingualism, mediation, parody, denunciation, imaginary dialogue, vernacular expression miscomprehension, incomprehension, dead letters, unread masterpieces, absolute heterogeneity of meaning and related hazards will also present"" (Arts of the Contact 37). My dissertation chapters discuss how using Spanish, these Chicana writers construct poetic spaces and intertextuality from domestic situations, and create a minor literature that questions the concepts considered stable and homogeneous like the idea of nation, language and identity. Furthermore these women also propose their own feminism ranging from the personal to the collective, acting like true conspirators in contact zones. My study is necessary for several reasons. The first reason is because the literary critics overlooked the works of Chicana writers written in Spanish. Although these authors have not been totally ignored by critics, especially Chicano critics, the fact is that these studies have focused on the ones written in English translated into English. A second reason is that there is no study that has grouped these five writers (Lucha Corpi, Gina Valdes, Miriam Bornstein, Margarita Cota-Cárdenas and Erlinda Gonzales-Berry) as representatives of a Chicano literature written in Spanish in the eighties. The presence and contribution of Chicano literary woman remained in the dark for a long time. In the eighties there was an awakening of Chicano literature produced by the female community, as the Chicano woman found its place in American editorials, This was due to the socio-political claims of Chicano movement and also the rise of the feminist movement and civil rights in full fervor during those decades. However, as discussed at various points in this dissertation writing in Spanish did not offer the same publishing conditions experienced by other contemporary Chicano writers writing in English. This thesis covers this lack of attention toward cultural production in Spanish written by women, and shows the need to assert the Spanish language as a vehicle of expression of Chicano literature in the United States. Another reason for the need for this study its multidisciplinary theoretical approach. We understand that the works of these authors should not be regarded just as a purely literary product; in fact they also are tools to understand the variety of Chicano contexts. These writers show a creative desire that goes beyond spatial barriers that reinforce social differences and power relations based on race, class, sex, gender and national status. Supporting this perspective, a cultural and textual analysis of his works should incorporate transcultural argument that reveals two impossibilities: the existence of a single cultural heritage, as expressed by the Moroccan philosopher Abdelkebir Khatibi in his article ""plural Maghreb"", and the inability to oppose the cultural hegemony from positions based on absolute truths of race and ethnicity.

Nearly all of the prisoners had been convicted of acts of homicide against plantation owners, mayorales (overseers), and contra-mayorales (managers) of various estates. The enslaved convicts were connected to resistance movements in Havana, Pinar del Rio, and above all, Matanzas, the sugar-producing core of the island. They served their entire sentences in the Presidio de San Juan, otherwise known as the Cárcel de la Princesa, which became a colonial showcase of punitive disciplinary regulation, modeled in many ways after the slave plantation system itself. There, exiled slaves were subjected to a penal regime similar to what they had experienced in Cuba. Indeed, many were taken from confinement proper to labor on the island's defensive fortification projects and road works, above all, to Puerto Rico's Carretera Central, after 1872, whose builders also included Sino-Cuban penal exiles. However, at the same time, similar to enslaved exploits in Cuba, enchained Africans and their descendants equally challenged their oppression while clutched by the juggernaut of Puerto Rican penal control. Hence, examining the overlooked structural inter-connections between these two Spanish colonial territories, this study also firmly looks to conceptualize Resistance proper as a permanent process and therefore as a structure within the theory of capital. This dissertation is a comparative study of these two built-environments along with the Spanish Peninsula that regulated the social relations of slaves, and how they responded to these regulations, as they became increasingly strident militaristic. The study centers on slaves from Cuba who were condemned to penal servitude. However, as part of the comparative analysis, the investigation also explores the respective development and application of the Bourbon Reforms within Iberian society as a means to unveil the structural homologies and heterologies of the spatial-social operation of global capital during the late-eighteenth to the late-nineteenth century period. I analyze the simultaneous rise of the ""industrial"" phase of the Cuban ingenio (sugar mill) during the island's exponential augmentation in sugar production, and the ""industrial"" phase of penal institutions and structures of confinement in Puerto Rico during the same period. This dissertation contends that the process of capital exploitation and labor formation and extraction were practically identical in all three locations and their corresponding foundational logics were one and the same. Furthermore, the parallel emergence and development of the 'industrial plantation' and the 'industrial penal system' thus became central to the process of modernization in the Spanish Caribbean, revealing an ever-increasing U.S. imperial orbit.",1658528492,,Dissertations & Theses," Ortiz-Minaya, ReynaldoOrtiz-MinayaReynaldoOrtiz-Minaya, Reynaldo", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3606108071 , 92149802 , 66569 , 9781321572124 , 3683188 , 3683188", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321572124, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1658528492?accountid=14496," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Caribbean Studies , Latin American Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , 19th century caribbean , Capital , Cuban slavery , Penality , Puerto rico , Spatiality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+plantation+to+prison%3A+Visual+economies%0Aof+slave+resistance%2C+criminal+justice%2C+and+penal+exile+in+the+Spanish+Caribbean+1820-1886&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ortiz-Minaya%2C+Reynaldo&amp;isbn=9781321572124&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Preserving the homefront: Marinship, California's Black war labor and historic World War II site","This thesis will examine the relationship between the African American Labor Movement of the 1940s, headed by A. Philip Randolph, and the Marinship Emergency Shipyard in the fight for racial equality between wartime industries African American workers and their White counterparts which ended in the California Supreme Court case James v Marinship. Between 1942 and 1945, Marinship became known as the nation's most advanced and efficient shipyard. This former shipyard in Sausalito, California, was one of six Emergency Shipyards built in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. African Americans, as well as other minorities, left their homes in the Midwest and South to pursue new careers at Marinship. African American workers made up ten percent of Marinship's employment. In 1943, the A-41 auxiliary of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders and Helpers of America Union was created exclusively for African Americans employed at Marinship. The auxiliary union restricted African Americans laborers from reaping the same benefits as their White counterparts. During the 1940s many movements transpired in the United States, for equal employment opportunities. The law case, James v. Marinship, is an example of a single event that showcased the ongoing struggle for equality, particularly in the work place for African Americans. Many people in the Sausalito area hoped that Marinship would remain open after the war. Instead, all the Bay Area Emergency Shipyards were also closed after the war. Marinship was decommissioned in 1946 and formally transferred to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1949. The General Services Administration gave 67.56 acres of the former yard to the Army Corps. The Army Corps then subdivided the yard and sold off large chunks to local industries and retained 11.4 acres at the core of the yard. The property known as Marinship has become a home to many commercial buildings. In the summer of 2013, the National Park Service Cultural Resource Diversity Internship Program (CRDIP) listed the California State Office of Historic Preservation as a site for their ten-week summer program. The property was discovered by an employee at the California State Office of Historic Preservation who after further research deemed the Marinship shipyard as eligible as a historic district property. After applying and interviewing for the CRDIP, I was selected as the research assistant to conduct the social history research, evaluate the integrity of the existing Marinship shipyard buildings and document those findings. I developed a historic context statement, evaluated the National and California Register eligibility, and prepared the appropriate forms for the Marinship Historic District in Sausalito, California. At the conclusion of the ten week summer program, I prepared the California Register of Historical Resources District Nomination form for the Marinship emergency shipyard. Included in the nomination form are ten extant buildings at the former shipyard. The following buildings contributed to the Marinship district and includes sufficient historical integrity; Building 10, Building 11, Building 12, Building 13, Building 15, Building 23, Building 29 and Building 30 which are all eligible under Criteria one. Criteria one eligibility includes a property's association with events that made a significant contribution to the local or regional history or cultural heritage of California or the United States. The property is also eligible for nomination under Criteria two due to its association with the James v. Marinship California Supreme Court case. Criteria two eligibility includes the property's association with the lives of persons who are important to local, California or national history. Within these two criteria the preservation office concluded that the focus of the Marinship shipyard would be its significance to California state history.",1660201019,,Dissertations & Theses," Reddon, Morrisa Sharron MoniqueReddonSharron MoniqueMorrisaReddon, Morrisa Sharron Monique", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3612397801 , 94478182 , 66569 , 9781321594782 , 1584706 , 1584706", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321594782, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1660201019?accountid=14496," 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0730 Museum studies"," 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0730 Museum studies"," 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0730 Museum studies",," 0582 Modern history , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0730 Museum studies"," Modern history , Ethnic studies , Museum studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , African american labor movement , Historic preservation , James v. marinship , Marinship shipyard , World war ii",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Preserving+the+homefront%3A+Marinship%2C+California%27s+Black+war+labor+and+historic+World+War+II+site&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reddon%2C+Morrisa+Sharron+Monique&amp;isbn=9781321594782&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Technological systems of small point weaponry of the Postclassic Lowland Maya (a.d. 1400 - 1697),"This study examines small projectile point technology of the Postclassic Lowland Maya (A.D. 1400 - 1697) using a technological systems framework, to evaluate production strategies and the movement of finished goods within Mesoamerican exchange networks. Small arrow points (1 - 3 cm long) were typically made from obsidian and microcrystalline silicates (chert, chalcedony), and were key components of bow-and-arrow weaponry among multiple Mayan-speaking groups and ethnopolities known as the Itza, Xiw, Kowoj, Chak'an Itza, Kehach, Dzuluinikob, Chetumal, Lakam tun (Lacandon), and Chuj. Literature suggests that the Late Postclassic period was a time of heightened ""international"" exchange, defined by frequent inter-polity interactions, information sharing, and intensified long-distance exchange of raw materials across political boundaries. Thus, this study adds to anthropological theory by focusing on the interplay between political geography and material culture to understand the relationship between non-elite goods and intensified social interaction. In total, this study analyzes 2,128 small projectile points originating from 17 different Lowland centers, focusing explicitly on the research domains of raw material procurement, production, use, repair, and discard. Multiple lithic analyses are used to collect data including macroscopic methods, taxonomic classification, and spatial-contextual analysis. Additionally, instrumental methods including portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and cross-over immuno-electrophoresis (CIEP) are used to identify raw material procurement patterns and interpret use activities related to the bow-and-arrow. The results of this study demonstrate that raw material preference and procurement strategies for small points varied significantly across the Maya Lowlands, and were often contingent on ethnopolitical affiliations and factionalism. In particular, strong differences emerge among neighboring polities within the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala, where the Itza, Kowoj, and Chak'an Itza maintained territories in close proximity to one another. A taxonomic and technological classification of small points reveals considerable variability in technological styles in addition to morphometric variability of haft types. Spatial-contextual analyses of depositional patterns demonstrate a range of activities associated with bow-and-arrow weaponry that often included symbolic associations with ritual and civic-ceremonial architecture. CIEP results reveal a multiplicity of use activities of the bow-and-arrow, with several positive immunological matches for indigenous and introduced fauna. Overall, the holistic approach of this dissertation helps bridge the divide between seemingly mundane artifacts and past economic behaviors that are critically important to Postclassic Maya studies.",1660540689,,Dissertations & Theses," Meissner, Nathan J.MeissnerJ.NathanMeissner, Nathan J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3613917481 , 90932252 , 66569 , 9781321600230 , 3684700 , 3684700", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321600230, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1660540689?accountid=14496, 0324 Archaeology, 0324 Archaeology, 0324 Archaeology,, 0324 Archaeology, Archaeology," Social sciences , Economic anthropology , Exchange , Lithics , Maya , Postclassic , Projectile technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Technological+systems+of+small+point+weaponry+of+the+Postclassic+Lowland+Maya+%28a.d.+1400+-+1697%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meissner%2C+Nathan+J.&amp;isbn=9781321600230&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Making Biosecurity, Making Mexico: An Ethnography of Biological Invasion","This dissertation tracks what happens when biology, that is, both life forms and knowledge about them, becomes the object of security. While increasing global traffic has led to a greater degree of movement of people, animals, plants, and microbes, biosecurity measures are concerned with regulating circulation and seek to work against such possibly homogenizing forces by both documenting and maintaining the distinctiveness of life forms in different places. Through ethnographic research in Mexico, I track the social logics, scientific practices, and institutional forms that underwrite biosecurity in three areas: invasive species control, emerging infectious disease research, and the use of transgenic organisms. I examine how conservationists working in Mexican settings – particularly on islands – alternately protect or exterminate the various life forms they encounter; how microbiologists and immunologists studying infectious diseases in Mexico make claims about the relationships between environments, bodies, and viral ecologies; and how ecologists regulate the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and turn them into bureaucratic objects. All these projects entail defining ""native"" life forms and establishing what is unique and valuable about Mexican biology. By bringing together this assortment of interlocutors and research sites I map how biosecurity projects establish the ways that a shared biological substantiality connects the nation and how human and non-human life forms are incorporated into political identities. Through these projects scientists produce knowledge about Mexican biology (including who or what is included or excluded in these populations). As this knowledge in turn informs political efforts to improve human and ecological health, biosecurity projects become ways in which science and the nation in Mexico are co-constituted. I address the production of biosecurity in two canonical places of science, the lab and the field, and I argue for the importance of a third scientific space, the office, a space where scientists engaged with bureaucratic processes and shaped the administration of Mexican ecosystems. Further, I argue that in Mexico biopolitics and biosecurity are no longer only about the regulation of human life, but have been extended beyond the human to encompass animal, plant, and microbial worlds. Mexican biopolitics have become multispecies projects.

In doing so, this thesis will shed light on debates relating to Muslim religious identity, urban life, social status, and gender reform. Madīnah newspaper was published in Bijnor qasbah in Bijnor district, UP, from 1912 onwards. By the early 20th century, elite, literate qasbah dwellers increased their attachment to their ashrāf identity, even as the definition of that social status group was being transformed. The nature of ashrāf conceptions of the qasbah in the Urdu newspaper conversation sheds light onto the nature of the Urdu public sphere, complicating existing narrative explanations of UP Muslim identity transformations. In the 12 years that constitute the span of the study, international developments such as the Italo-­‐Turkish War, the Balkan Wars, and World War I, with domestic transformations in municipal policies and the activism of some Hindu groups motivated Muslims to redefine their place in early 20th century society. At the same time, the early 20th century saw the rising prominence of the qasbah as a centre of spiritual and cultural life among ashrāf Muslims. World War I and the non-­‐cooperation movement threatened the British Empire’s hold on South Asia. In the midst of these shifting sands stood the city of Bijnor, a backwoods qasbah in the district of the same name. Bijnor’s publication Madīnah provided a regional platform for scholars, laymen, and poets to discuss their place in the new order. As part of a network of literary publications exchanged between qasbahs in the first half of the twentieth century, Madīnah shaped and complicated gender boundaries, religious identity, social status, and political alliance, all in the service of the Muslim ummah, or community. This thesis places Madīnah in the context of the broader Urdu newspaper market and the incipient newspaper culture of qasbahs, which both reflected the broadened geographic horizon of the qasbatī ashrāf and placed a premium on the qasbah as a place set apart from the city. After laying this foundation, the thesis turns to the place of Islam in qasbah newspapers and Madīnah. Newspapers reflected a division among ashrāf regarding the centrality of Islam in elite culture, revealing an ideological division between the qasbah and major urban centres Delhi, Lucknow, and Calcutta. Madīnah and other newspapers sought to establish an indelible link between Islam and ashrāf identity, in contrast to some urban newspapers, which sought to lay the groundwork instead for a secular, nationalized Muslim identity. This thesis then turns to the expanding geographic horizons of Madīnah newspaper, both enabled by novel technology and neutralized as a threat by careful framing of international and trans-‐regional content. The subsequent chapter deals with Madīnah's Women’s Newspaper, which demonstrated a trend toward gender ventriloquism in reformist approaches to gender. Many articles penned ostensibly by women had male authors; Madīnah's articles expressed a complex set of reactions to intimate female experiences, including curiosity, fascination, and anxiety. Qasbah newspapers offer new avenues for insight into the tensions that characterized the Urdu public of the early 20th century. This thesis highlights the character of qasbatī ashrāf's engagement with the broader literary conversation via newspapers during a time of dramatic social transformation, in the process contributing to the form of the Urdu public sphere.",1683608762,,Dissertations & Theses," Robb, Megan EatonRobbEatonMeganRobb, Megan Eaton", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3697545631 , 96377252 , 101309 , U632721 , U632721 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:aed9cab9-4c62-40ab-93dc-6d22189186f7", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1683608762?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0708 Mass communications", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0708 Mass communications"," Journalism , Middle Eastern Studies , Mass communications"," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:aed9cab9-4c62-40ab-93dc-6d22189186f7 , (UMI)AAIU632721 , Social sciences , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interpreting+the+qasbah+conversation%3A+muslims+and+madinah+newspaper%2C+1912-1924&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robb%2C+Megan+Eaton&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Promised land: The politics of abandonment and the struggle for a new Detroit,"This dissertation examines contemporary land-use and planning conflicts in Detroit where, in 2014, city officials classified 150,000 lots as ""vacant"" or ""abandoned."" Bringing urban geography into conversation with critical race studies and property theory, the dissertation illuminates how private property, personhood, and racial difference have shaped and been shaped by postindustrial urban crisis. Based on 17 months of engaged research conducted between 2010 and 2012, I examine how different visions for Detroit's future are enacted through black radical farming projects, a for-profit urban forestry venture, emergency management and bankruptcy, a tax foreclosure auction, and a citywide planning process aimed at repurposing Detroit's highest vacancy (or least populated) neighborhoods as urban wilderness while withdrawing infrastructure and public services. The dissertation shows that despite the widespread discourse of vacancy, the neighborhoods targeted for ""greening"" were not empty, but home to more than 100,000 people. This contradiction points to the inequities of an ascendant urban planning ethos that integrates rationalities of environmental sustainability and fiscal austerity while ignoring histories of racialized uneven development. Even as the controversial abandonment and greening of certain neighborhoods proceeded, social movements articulated the right to a different future city by mobilizing around the concepts of the commons and community self-determination. In addition to engaging with twenty-first century urban planning issues, the dissertation challenges historical narratives of the decline of Detroit and other postindustrial cities. Detroit's fall is typically narrated in relation to the global political economy of manufacturing, white flight, and capital flight. While these processes are important for understanding the spatial and economic predicaments Detroit faces, they are limited in two key ways. First, they cast urban abandonment as a past action, rather than an active process. Second, they elide community-based efforts to undo regimes of racial violence. I argue that the struggle for a new Detroit reveals the ""settler colonial present"" as a broader urban condition in the United States. The creation of more just and sustainable urban futures demands that we grapple with how the racialized history of property relations undergirds urban crisis and shapes the spatial imaginaries of those struggling for self-determination.",1685418680,,Dissertations & Theses," Safransky, SaraSafranskySaraSafransky, Sara", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3703747741 , 89195652 , 66569 , 9781321760316 , 3703920 , 3703920", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321760316, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685418680?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning",," 0366 Geography , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," Geography , Public policy , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Detroit , Political ecology , Racialization of space , Settler colonial present , Social movements , Urban planning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Promised+land%3A+The+politics+of+abandonment+and+the+struggle+for+a+new+Detroit&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Safransky%2C+Sara&amp;isbn=9781321760316&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Being nationalist: identity within a post-ottoman state,"The thesis defines and explores three different modalities of nationalism - diagnosis, activism and redemption - in the context of contemporary Bulgaria. Nationalists see a significant divergence between ‘who we should be' and ‘who we are'. This is accentuated by Bulgarian citizens' experiences of socio-political chaos and uncertainty. The thesis looks at the political rituals which aim to redeem the ‘ill' Bulgarian nation, conceived as both post-Ottoman and post-Soviet. It focuses the importance of affect for understanding the relevance of the nation for citizens' sense of self. I begin by examining the apparatus of production through which the Bulgarian national subject is imbued with a particular character. I consider how it has been constituted historically and how it continues to be moulded by contemporary discourses. I demonstrate that ‘being Bulgarian' is nowadays a primarily negative state of being, defined through the discourse of the ill nation. As far as nationalists are concerned, this illness can be cured only through attempting, out of the debris of historical contingency, to renew social structures so that they more closely resemble the ideal. My research focussed on one nationalist organisation in Bulgaria which attempted to fulfil this task: VMRO (or IMRO- the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Movement). I explore how the organisation creates and renews itself as a descendant of the national revival movements of the 19th and early 20th century, and thus as a valid form of contemporary nationalism, while at the same time it fills the role of a modern political party. To heal the nation, VMRO declares a need to be vigilant against further catastrophes and to address the consequences of previous ones. It thus interprets existing social grievances according to specific narratives about the nation's problems and prescribes redemptive action. VMRO addresses a public which has internalised a sense of being judged by ‘the international' (often imagined as ‘a dictate'). This is not the ‘real'international, but an imagined, power-laden domain. Nationalists engage with this domain by constructing illicit discourses which challenge this nexus of power. In the thesis, I explore how the traditional imperatives of a nationalist organisation - making claims for territories, populations and minority issues - are hybridized by the organisation's dialogic engagement with both ‘the international', with citizens' daily concerns and their affective states.",1685876341,,Dissertations & Theses," Ratcheva, VesselinaRatchevaVesselinaRatcheva, Vesselina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3704715031 , 93846172 , 101309 , U633452 , U633452 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/49477/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685876341?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/49477/ , (UMI)AAIU633452 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Being+nationalist%3A+identity+within+a+post-ottoman+state&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ratcheva%2C+Vesselina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"New way of healing: experienced counsellors' perceptions of the influence of ch’i-related exercises on counselling practice in taiwan,"This study examines how Taiwanese senior counsellors with substantial experience of ch’i-related exercise (CRE) perceived the influence of their regular CRE on their counselling practice. I am interested in the perceived influence of CRE on both self-care and professional practice. In this studyn this studyn this study n this study n this study n this study, CRE, CRE, CRE, CRE, CRE refers to any refers to any refers to any refers to any ch'i enhancing exercise that coordinates movement with breathing and inner concentration wherein ch'i is a first order concept used by practitioners and regarded by them as an embodiment of ideas related to human life and human existence and able to be experienced and refined through any ch'i related exercise. CRE is a set of practices and an intrinsic part of local culture in Taiwan which in recent years, has become popular practice in Taiwanese society. There are growing numbers of counselling professionals involved in regular CRE in recent years. Studies examining the effects of CRE indicate the benefits of CRE on practitioners' global health and personal growth. However, no previous study has investigated the influence of the long-term regular use of CRE on counsellors‟ self-care and counselling practice. The narrative research design for this study was developed from a post-structural theoretical perspective located in the domain of social constructivism. The data were co-constructed between the researcher and 12 senior Taiwanese counsellors with substantial CRE experience using a semi-structured in-depth interview approach. Interview data were analysed using the structure-based approach developed by William Labov in the field of socio-linguistics. The study reveals an overall benefit of regular involvement in CRE for practitioners' global wellbeing and personal growth counsellor' self-care. The research findings also reveals the potential of ch’i to be used as a way of expressing health and illness and a way of understanding in therapy and CRE to be lived out in therapy as an embodiment. I argue that collectively the narratives, as a whole, give evidence of an increasing integratin of the ideas and practices of ch’i into counselling practice in contemporary Taiwan. This might even make up a new form of integrated and culturally appropriate practice, what I term ""a new way of healing."" These are therapeutic practices which value the potential of CRE for counsellor's self-care and personal growth; recognize the integral whole of the human person; promote conscious use of the knowledge and experience of ch’i and CRE in therapy as an important aspect of the therapeutic use of self. Implications for practice such as the potential of CRE to be introduced into counsellor training programmes for counsellors' preparation or ongoing education are provided. Recommendations for future research such as the development of a new healing modality based on the research findings are offered.",1687701207,,Dissertations & Theses," Liou, Chin-PingLiouChin-PingLiou, Chin-Ping", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713047471 , 96800602 , 101309 , U640007 , U640007 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9496", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687701207?accountid=14496," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," Alternative Medicine , Counseling Psychology"," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9496 , (UMI)AAIU640007 , Psychology , Health and environmental sciences , China",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+way+of+healing%3A+experienced+counsellors%27+perceptions+of+the+influence+of+ch%E2%80%99i-related+exercises+on+counselling+practice+in+taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liou%2C+Chin-Ping&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""'every honour except canonisation': the global development of the burns supper, 1801 to 2009","This thesis is the first thorough investigation into the phenomenon known as the Burns Supper. This has grown spontaneously over the years from a nine man dinner at Burns Cottage, Alloway in July 1801 which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of Robert Burns, to over 3,500 dinners embracing more than nine million people across the world during the celebration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his birth in 2009. The original event took the form of a convivial club dinner, typical of that period and using invented ritual paying homage to Freemasonry, key elements were grafted onto the running order which remain core today: notably a toast to Burns (‘the Immortal Memory’), poetically addressing (and eating) a haggis and performing Burns’s songs and poems including Auld Lang Syne. While the other contemporary societies and annual literary dinners have fallen into desuetude, the Burns Supper has exhibited longevity and a growth in scale annually that is exceptional. The success of the format is three-fold. First, the Burns Supper remains a social and convivial party; secondly, there is a greater degree of flexibility in how it can be arranged than is often recognised; and finally, the few mandatory elements are key to understanding Burns’s own imperative to be recognised as ‘Bard’ within a milieu which calls for participation. The original Burns Suppers recognised this and deliberately utilised Burns’s most performative verse to capture the spirit of his oeuvre and by incorporating that bardic quiddity, the Burns Supper two hundred years later still shares that fundamental experience which is essential to its immediacy and integrity as a vehicle for the appreciation of Robert Burns. By detailed study of the original minutes of the early suppers, combined, for the first time, with extensive newspaper reports, club archives and biographical sources, the expansion of participation in the Burns Supper from friends of the poet through to Scots at home or expatriate, to the wider global audience is tracked and analysed. As with all amateur (in both senses) movements, enthusiasm has at times exceeded critical judgement and the fear of change has been self-defeating. The simple paradox is that from the Second World War while the academic study of Burns was in steep decline, the number of people attending Burns Suppers grew consistently. By a mutual recognition that the Burns Supper, like Burns’s poetry, is not in the ownership of one nationality, political party or gender, the Burns Supper remains the largest literary festival in the world.",1687707847,,Dissertations & Theses," McGinn, ClarkMcGinnClarkMcGinn, Clark", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713049231 , 93849262 , 101309 , U640237 , U640237 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5232/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687707847?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5232/ , (UMI)AAIU640237 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27every+honour+except+canonisation%27%3A+the+global+development+of+the+burns+supper%2C+1801+to+2009&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McGinn%2C+Clark&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Narratives of economic migration: the case of young, well-qualified poles and spaniards in the uk","This thesis investigates the dynamics, motivations and external factors influencing the migration trajectories of 22 young, well-qualified Polish and Spanish migrants in the South of England. The study is among the first ones researching the current movement of people from Spain to the UK in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007/08, and comparing it to post-EU-accession migration from Eastern Europe. The methodology involves semi-structured, autobiographical interviews focusing on participants’ migration experiences, with a particular focus on their professional ambitions in the UK labour market. The findings of the study demonstrate how both groups interpret emigration as an act of establishing a certain form of normality, be it social, economic or individual. Overall, however, the narratives reveal differences that run along the lines of nationality. In the Polish narratives in particular, a strong focus on the immediate present becomes evident. The present life in the UK, no matter how challenging, is almost always compared to a past in Poland that is retrospectively defined as ‘abnormal’. Participants create a discourse of escape that is then used to make sense of an often ‘not ideal’ present in which participants, despite being university educated, spend prolonged periods of time in low-level jobs. The Spanish narratives, on the other hand, tend to be highly politicised and participants display a strong sense of individualisation and political anger. Most narratives are characterised by an ‘ideology of progress’. Spain is referred to as a space of personal and professional stagnation, while time spent in the UK is seen as a conscious investment in human capital such as English skills. The aim of this investment is the establishment of a certain socio-economic status in the future, and menial jobs in the UK are acceptable as long as participants work towards that goal. In summary, the thesis analyses how both groups react to social and economic changes in times of a global economic crisis, and describes how participants tend to meet unknown circumstances with a known set of behavioural dispositions.",1687709749,,Dissertations & Theses," Jendrissek, DanJendrissekDanJendrissek, Dan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713047841 , 96800782 , 101309 , U639092 , U639092 , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/366444/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687709749?accountid=14496, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0510 Economics, Economics," http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/366444/ , (UMI)AAIU639092 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Narratives+of+economic+migration%3A+the+case+of+young%2C+well-qualified+poles+and+spaniards+in+the+uk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jendrissek%2C+Dan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Musical meaning and social significance: techno triggers for dancing,"Electronically-produced dance music has only recently achieved as much visibility in the global pop music industry as ‘live’ or instrumental pop. Yet the fascination of cultural scholars and sociologists with dance music predates its rise as a product of mass culture. Much of this interest derives from early associations of dance music with marginalised groups and oppositional ideologies. It therefore follows that many explorations of dance music focus on the ways in which techno, house and practices of ‘raving’ are expressions of dissent. As a result, the cultural aspects of dance music are necessarily the focus of these studies, with few musicologists addressing musical features and fewer dance scholars considering the specifics of dance movement. What is more, these differing approaches tend to compete rather than collaborate. In my thesis, I seek to address this divergence and to draw attention to the ways that contrasting disciplinary approaches can complement and enrich the study of any music. I use contemporary techno club nights in Edinburgh as a focal point for addressing musical and social triggers for dancing. I explore subjective experiences of dancing, DJing and producing by interspersing a review of existing literature with my own ethnographic research and musical analysis. Subsequently, I consider how the philosophies of techno are embodied within the movements and postures of the dancing body and social interaction. Participants in techno settings adopt strikingly similar attitudes to the institutionalised classical music world, despite the fundamental differences between the practices of composition, performance and listening. Moreover, these attitudes are repeatedly disseminated by participants, journalists and scholars. My enquiry into social and musical dancing triggers leads me to question the perpetuation of these ideas.",1687709878,,Dissertations & Theses," Gadir, Tami EsterGadirEsterTamiGadir, Tami Ester", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713046381 , 93846932 , 101309 , U639367 , U639367 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9478", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687709878?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0413 Music, Music," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9478 , (UMI)AAIU639367 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Musical+meaning+and+social+significance%3A+techno+triggers+for+dancing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gadir%2C+Tami+Ester&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Whose rules?: the institutional diffusion and variation of private participatory governance,"As a mode of global sustainability regulation, private participatory governance first emerged in the forestry sector in the early 1990s and from there spread rapidly and widely in the global economy. The literature on the topic points to a good fit with democratic norms, neoliberal norms, social movement pressure, and the entrepreneurial activities of civil society actors and progressive firms as the main drivers behind this process of institutional diffusion. Today, multi-stakeholder initiatives operate in many industry sectors, ranging from apparel manufacturing and diamond mining to aquaculture production and soybean farming. Drawing on new developments in the philosophy of democracy, some see these arrangements as part of a ‘deliberative turn’ in sustainability politics with the potential to democratise global governance institutions. However, the legitimacy of multi-stakeholder initiatives remains contested, and there is evidence to suggest that the diffusion of private participatory governance in the global economy has introduced variation in a key dimension of institutional design: whereas some schemes involve a wide range of actors in their governance and standard-setting activities, others are significantly less inclusive. In order to explore this puzzle, this dissertation unpacks the process of institutional diffusion. It develops an analytical framework that distinguishes three stages in the diffusion process: source selection, transmission, and adoption. For the different stages, hypotheses are formulated about the factors that “intervene” in the diffusion process, leading to more or less inclusive institutional outcomes. This framework is put to work in three case study chapters, examining the diffusion of private participatory governance in the biofuels, soy, and sugarcane sectors. A major finding of this study is that varying levels of coercive institutional pressures influenced the diffusion outcome in the cases studied. In environments characterised by strong coercive pressures (biofuels and soy), adopting a more inclusive approach served institutional designers as a strategy to gain political authority – that is, legitimate decision-making power – in these arenas. In comparison, in the low conflict environment of the sugarcane sector, no comparable process of ‘institutional fitting’ could be observed. Furthermore, this dissertation shows that ideas about private participatory governance are far from set in stone. While multi-stakeholder institutions diffuse in the global economy, late adopters learn from the experiences of prior adopters. Based on these experiences and the lessons they draw from them, they interpret, innovate, and de- and recontextualise the model, giving rise to institutional variation.",1689624597,,Dissertations & Theses," Schleifer, PhilipSchleiferPhilipSchleifer, Philip", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3718857131 , 96801622 , 101309 , U641005 , U641005 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/938/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689624597?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/938/ , (UMI)AAIU641005 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Whose+rules%3F%3A+the+institutional+diffusion+and+variation+of+private+participatory+governance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schleifer%2C+Philip&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Geospatial economics,"Understanding how economic systems interact with ecosystems requires models that include geospatial heterogeneity. Integration of economic and ecological systems is vital for sustainable development, especially with respect to climate change, food security and the management of common property resources. Advances in remote sensing and geographic information systems have created a wealth of data applicable to economics, but it is challenging to incorporate high-resolution, global data in existing economic models. In this thesis, I integrate geospatial data with economic theory to analyze important environmental problems. The next three chapters describe the techniques I use for modeling geospatially-explicit economic systems and apply them to current environmental challenges. Chapter one addresses the tradeoffs between food production and environmental protection. I address the question of how we can optimally feed a growing population (requiring a 100% increase in calorie production by 2050) while minimizing the loss of carbon storage (which is important for mitigating climate change). I use high-resolution, gridded global data to give geospatial specificity to the results of the optimization. The framework I present in this chapter includes only one production choice and one environmental good, but it is more broadly applicable to multiple goods and multiple ecosystem services. This chapter also shows how using geospatial data can increase the policy relevance of an analysis. For example, instead of claiming that tropical forests are in general very valuable, using geospatial data allows for the more precise claim that this specific 10 kilometer patch of forest is better kept as forest than cultivated. Spatially explicit information like this can help construct more specific policies, such as food-for-carbon swaps or identifying which parcels ought to be protected first given a limited conservation budget. Chapter two presents a microeconomic model of spatial foraging that addresses how humans gather goods on a spatially heterogeneous landscape when transport costs are non-negligible. The general problem of foraging arises when multiple agents located in space compete for resources that are characterized by their location. I use agent-based simulation methods to account for agents that must move over the landscape subject to terrain and road networks, depletion by rival agents and spatial heterogeneity with a large number of agents (10 million). The model is applicable to several topics in environmental economics, including fuelwood collection and fisheries management, but also more general economic topics such as housing, employment search, transportation, pollution and urban economics. Another contribution of chapter two is that it makes several methodological advances that allow for spatially-explicit agent-based simulation on extremely large systems. These advances are of two types: first, I present data creation methods that allow for high resolution data to be created globally, relying on satellite-derived data products and spatial downscaling techniques to estimate environmental and social indicators, such as population density or spatially defined wages. Second, I identify computational methods (and implement them in a software application) that allows for fast calculation of agent interactions and movement of space. I discuss the data storage types necessary for this along with a method of vectorizing the calculations to enable computation of extremely large systems (with as many as 10 billion agents). Chapter two concludes an application of the spatial foraging model in which I assess how villagers in Tanzania gather firewood from forests. Firewood collection is a useful example because the need for a spatially explicit model is clear. Transportation costs of firewood are very high relative to their value and firewood in almost always collected by agents foraging for their own consumption. For instance, Fabe and Grote (2013) report that 97.5% of household in Tanzania use firewood as their main fuel, but only 13% of firewood is purchased. I define behavior rules in the simulation based on a microeconomic agricultural household production model (Singh et al. 1986, Bardhan and Udry 1999) apply them to high-resolution geospatial data for Tanzania. I iteratively simulate individual agents' foraging actions and observe the value of firewood obtained. The estimates obtained from this method match existing estimates of firewood collection while providing more detail about where the firewood is collected. The empirical application presented in chapter two is useful to practitioners of ecosystem serve estimation. Calculating the ecosystem service value of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been difficult in practice due to computational and theoretical problems. Existing estimation approaches identify the abundance of NTFPs on different forest types but do not explicitly state how agents gather the firewood. The approach I use accounts for how these gathering decisions interact with the abundance of NTFPs to determine the ecosystem service value.

What was life like for the rest of Soviet society? What was it like for the vast population who usually supported the regime, mostly accepted the rules, essentially internalized the ideology, and generally made the same choices as their neighbors and friends? What was it like to live Soviet? This project seeks to provide answers to those questions. It is a close examination of a group of the last two Soviet generations from Kharkiv, Ukraine, covering their lives from childhood to the present. The Brezhnev era, when many of them came of age, was arguably the most stable for the Soviet peoples; since then, their world has turned upsidedown. During this period, Kharkiv’s military professors and their families—the primary subjects of this project—went from comfortable economic circumstances, professional prestige, and political influence as part of the upper stratum of a superpower, to virtual destitution and ignominy in the mid-1990s. Today, many of them are part of Europe’s largest ethnic minority—Russians in Ukraine. Having always considered themselves Soviets, they woke up one morning to find themselves in the new, “foreign” country of independent Ukraine. I conducted 65 “life history” and follow-up interviews with this group, as well as 15 interviews with their civilian counterparts, for a total of 80 interviews. The 3,000+ pages of transcripts generated from this research provide the core of my evidence. Supplementing those sources with materials gleaned from personal, family, and institutional archives, I investigate how these families endured shifting social, cultural, and political realities—and show what those experiences have to offer the study of Soviet and post-Soviet history, bridging the borders and boundaries created by the collapse of the USSR and exploring the foundations of 21st-century Ukraine. The military officers in this study personified the Soviet state’s ambitions—both in the official propaganda and in their own personal identities. From the 1960s on, these officers and their comrades made up a volunteer, professional, and cohesive officer corps that was dedicated to the defense of their state, was highly trained and educated, and was insistent on high standards of performance. These men internalized Marxist-Leninist ideology and were committed to safeguarding the Soviet state, indoctrinating its conscripts, and spreading communism worldwide—the three most important reasons that the Soviet leadership maintained the world’s largest military from 1945 until the collapse of the USSR. These were the New Soviet Military Men, and their lives were so entwined with the state they served that when it fell, so did they. The study of these men, their families, and their contemporaries—as individuals—provides insights into Soviet society and the continuing transition of that society in eastern Ukraine, especially in the areas of gender, ethnicity/nationality, and religion. In the mature Soviet Union, women had clearly defined boundaries at home and at work. Transcending those boundaries took skill, extraordinary drive, and a considerable amount of effort—but it could be done, both at the workplace and in the home. In terms of ethnicity and nationality, the individuals described in this study did not move across borders; rather, the borders moved across them. As their history shows, a diaspora is not always created by the movement of people; in post-Soviet Ukraine, it was possible to be a transnational individual without ever travelling. These are not individuals who had to divest themselves of “natural” national feelings; rather, they were supranational individuals who were forced into transnationality by circumstances. In the post-Soviet period, they learned the mentalities of nationalism in response to nationalist initiatives from others. Regarding religion, I argue that the number of believers in the USSR was always quite strong; grandmothers kept baptizing babies and whispering prayers even when the society seemed to be entirely secularized. The secrecy that surrounded religious belief was also quite strong, demanded by an ideology that required an atheistic society. Overall—both while they were living it and in their memories—life in the Soviet Union was profoundly normal. Joy and heartbreak, triumph and failure, daily life and professional lives—all were experienced not within the framework of Orwellian repression or titanic struggle, but within the framework of daily, normal, Soviet life.",1734460001,,Dissertations & Theses," Westrate, Michael T.WestrateT.MichaelWestrate, Michael T.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3870999091 , 100295452 , 66569 , 9781339180236 , 3731619 , 3731619", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781339180236, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734460001?accountid=14496," 0582 Modern history , 0724 Russian history"," 0582 Modern history , 0724 Russian history"," 0582 Modern history , 0724 Russian history",," 0582 Modern history , 0724 Russian history"," Modern history , Russian history"," Social sciences , Contemporary history , Cultural history , Eurasian history , Military history , Soviety history , Ukrainian history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Under+the+falling+red+star%3A+Living+Soviet+in+Kharkiv%2C+Ukraine+from+the+1960s+to+the+present&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Westrate%2C+Michael+T.&amp;isbn=9781339180236&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The sspnet-mobile corpus: from the detection of non-verbal cues to the inference of social behaviour during mobile phone conversations,"Mobile phones are one of the main channels of communication in contemporary society. However, the effect of the mobile phone on both the process of and, also, the non-verbal behaviours used during conversations mediated by this technology, remain poorly understood. This thesis aims to investigate the role of the phone on the negotiation process as well as, the automatic analysis of non-verbal behavioural cues during conversations using mobile telephones, by following the Social Signal Processing approach. The work in this thesis includes the collection of a corpus of 60 mobile phone conversations involving 120 subjects, development of methods for the detection of non-verbal behavioural events (laughter, fillers, speech and silence) and the inference of characteristics influencing social interactions (personality traits and conflict handling style) from speech and movements while using the mobile telephone, as well as the analysis of several factors that influence the outcome of decision-making processes while using mobile phones (gender, age, personality, conflict handling style and caller versus receiver role). The findings show that it is possible to recognise behavioural events at levels well above chance level, by employing statistical language models, and that personality traits and conflict handling styles can be partially recognised. Among the factors analysed, participant role (caller versus receiver) was the most important in determining the outcome of negotiation processes in the case of disagreement between parties. Finally, the corpus collected for the experiments (the SSPNet-Mobile Corpus) has been used in an international benchmarking campaign and constitutes a valuable resource for future research in Social Signal Processing and more generally in the area of human-human communication.",1774249434,,Dissertations & Theses," Polychroniou, AnnaPolychroniouAnnaPolychroniou, Anna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989344371 , 93850822 , 101309 , 10034120 , 10034120 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5686/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774249434?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5686/ , (UMI)AAI10034120 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sspnet-mobile+corpus%3A+from+the+detection+of+non-verbal+cues+to+the+inference+of+social+behaviour+during+mobile+phone+conversations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Polychroniou%2C+Anna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The crisis of the arab critic: ʽabdullah al-ghadhāmī as case study,"This study examines the crisis of the Arab critic at the present time; it focuses on the works of the Saudi critic ʽAbdullah al-Ghadhāmī as a case study. The function of criticism has always been affected by political and cultural developments; critics have constantly adapted their role in order to maintain their credibility as intellectual leaders of society. However, this role has been recently called into question by global changes. This research examines the critic’s anxiety about these transformations; cultural criticism provides a lifeline that helps critics to address daily-life issues and engage with reality. However, the situation in the Arab world is complicated; the cultural dilemmas of the Arabs have long affected their development. In this context, Arab intellectuals have lost their role, being no longer able to influence and lead change; political reaction and social rejection have made them exiles in their own homeland. This study investigates the mechanism that rendered the discourse of modern Arabic criticism socially ineffective. Al-Ghadhāmī’s intellectual career, the study argues, illustrates the crisis of the Arab critic; his critique, in line with changes in social and political circumstances, can be divided into three distinct periods: the early works of the 1980s show his great enthusiasm for modernising the critical discourse by embracing modern structuralist and post-structuralist theories. Nevertheless, the efforts made by al-Ghadhāmī and his fellow modernists were crushed by the Islamic movement al-Ṣaḥwa al-Islāmiyya, which was given a virtually free hand to dominate Saudi society. The effect of this defeat is evident in al-Ghadhāmī’s works of the second period; he adopts a moderate position, from which he tries to revive the heritage and question it at the same time. However, this attempt does not last long; the third period begins with al-Ghadhāmī’s dramatic announcement of the death of literary criticism, urging his fellow critics to replace it with cultural criticism. This radical proposal is the most extreme of al-Ghadhāmī’s reactions to the crisis of the Arab critic.",1775215636,,Dissertations & Theses," Alzahrani, Adel KhamisAlzahraniKhamisAdelAlzahrani, Adel Khamis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3992940531 , 103020722 , 101309 , 10038542 , 10038542 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/7812/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775215636?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/7812/ , (UMI)AAI10038542 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+crisis+of+the+arab+critic%3A+%CA%BDabdullah+al-ghadh%C4%81m%C4%AB+as+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alzahrani%2C+Adel+Khamis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Cultural politics of climate change activism in the uk as public pedagogy (2005-2011): direct action, relocalisation, and professional activism","This thesis is a study of the cultural politics of environmentalism in an era of climate change and the public curriculum that it generates. Scientists and the policy elite alone are unlikely to solve the ‘wicked problem’ of climate change, even in the unlikely scenario that consensus was reached and concerted international action was forthcoming. Increasingly, it is recognised that institutional learning through technocratic refinements of the status quo are inadequate. Although there is widespread belief that anthropogenic global warming is an urgent problem, political action has not followed scientific knowledge, because we have been slow to recognise the problem’s cultural implications. A range of voices within the environmental movement (broadly conceived) have increasingly challenged technocratic policy framing, with new ways of thinking. By widening the debate these critical voices increase the possibility of learning to react in new ways, which increase the capacity for collective agency. Based on this assessment, the aim of this thesis is to explore the ways in which the cultural politics of particular activist milieus generate public curriculum, through catalyzing the relationship between the cultural politics of civil society and the political culture of the state. From the 1960s onwards, the environmental movement has undergone a process of differentiation and specialisation, such that distinct cultural formations – oriented around direct action, relocalisation, and professional campaigning – emerged. Different ideal typical modes of “climate change communication” – agonistic pluralism, public participation, and social marketing (Carvalho &amp; Peterson, 2012) – can be mapped onto the public pedagogies of these activist cultures. Political theorist Chantal Mouffe (2005, p. 20) uses the term agonistic pluralism to describe a situation where the “adversary” is understood in a productive sense to be “a crucial category for democratic politics”: where this is denied, we/they relations are understood to be “antagonistic” in the sense that conflicting parties do not recognise the legitimacy of one another. This view recognises the power play and affective commitments that determine modes of political association. On the other hand, “public participation” views politics as constituted through non-partisan rational deliberation in legitimate public fora. Finally, “social marketing” approaches discard the notion of people as rational decision makers, but also discard the principle of public participation in favour of the notion that political communication can be improved through expert evidence-based interventions. Cultures of direct climate action tend towards agonistic communicative styles, characterised by contestatory moments and a public pedagogy of “defining the enemy” (Newman, 1994). On the other hand, this approach has been perceived as problematic by movement intellectuals in relocalisation movements, who have argued that the non-politicised experimental practices of local communities, which engage optimistically with a sense of the possible, may in the long run, be more productive of the kind of mass cultural value shift required in order to tackle climate change. More recently, reflecting their own situated organisational structures and actor-networks, knowledge workers in the professional campaigning sector have increasingly applied insights from social psychology, behavioural economics, and cognitive science in order to find ways that engage tacit cultural values and norms in their public pedagogical efforts. In seeking to ascertain the ideal conditions for communication, the ENGO sector aligns most closely with a ‘social marketing approach’ to public pedagogy. Working with the ‘agonistic’ discourse theory of Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau, I believe that all cultures of activism necessarily engage in a contingent politics of articulation, at the heart of which lies antagonism and hegemonic struggle. In this thesis, I construct an intertextual research model, capable of exploring the contingent processes of articulation within cultures of climate change activism, between them, and between the movement at large, and the wider public, as they engage (implicitly or explicitly) in hegemonic struggles that provide moments of educative potential to activists, bystanders and politicians. I argue that the public pedagogies of these cultures of activism cohere around the articulation of what Laclau (2005) would call “empty signifiers”, which link particular claims, interests, and identities through creating a frontier separating them from an outside, which partially constitutes the inside’s identity.",1775429129,,Dissertations & Theses," McGregor, Callum KennethMcGregorKennethCallumMcGregor, Callum Kenneth", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3974074541 , 102698722 , 101309 , 10033572 , 10033572 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9832", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775429129?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/9832 , (UMI)AAI10033572 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultural+politics+of+climate+change+activism+in+the+uk+as+public+pedagogy+%282005-2011%29%3A+direct+action%2C+relocalisation%2C+and+professional+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McGregor%2C+Callum+Kenneth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The demography of the greenland white-fronted goose,"New analytical and technological tools have the potential to yield unprecedented insights into the life histories of migratory species. I used Bayesian population models and Global Positioning System-acceleration tracking devices to understand the demographic mechanism and likely drivers underpinning the Greenland White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons flavirostris) population decline. I used a 27-year capture-mark-recapture dataset from the main wintering site for these birds (Wexford, Ireland) to construct multistate models that estimated age- and sex-specific survival and movement probabilities and found no sex-bias in emigration or ‘remigration’ rates (chapter 2). These formed the foundation for an integrated population model, which included population size and productivity data to assess source-sink dynamics through estimation of age-, site-, and year-specific survival and movement probabilities, the results of which suggest that Wexford is a large sink and that a reduction in productivity (measured as recruitment rate) is the proximate demographic mechanism behind the population decline (chapter 3). Low productivity may be due to environmental conditions on breeding areas in west Greenland, whereby birds bred at youngest ages when conditions were favourable during adulthood and the breeding year (chapter 4), and possibly mediated by links with the social system, as birds remained with parents into adulthood, forfeiting immediate reproductive success, although a cost-benefit model showed the ‘leave’ strategy was marginally favoured over the ‘stay’ strategy at all ages (chapter 5). Foraging during spring does not appear to limit breeding, as breeding and non-breeding birds did not differ in their proportion of time feeding or energy expenditure (chapter 6). Two successful breeding birds were the only tagged individuals (of 15) to even attempt to nest, suggesting low breeding propensity has contributed to low productivity. Although birds wintering in Ireland migrated further to breeding areas than those wintering in Scotland, there were no differences in feeding between groups during spring migration (chapter 7). These findings suggest that Greenland White-fronted Geese are not limited until arrival on breeding areas and the increasingly poor environmental conditions there (chapter 8). More broadly, these findings demonstrate the application of novel tools to diagnose the cause of population decline.",1777324046,,Dissertations & Theses," Weegman, Mitchell DaleWeegmanDaleMitchellWeegman, Mitchell Dale", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4005079861 , 90007352 , 101309 , 10068399 , 10068399 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/16211", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1777324046?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/16211 , (UMI)AAI10068399 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+demography+of+the+greenland+white-fronted+goose&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weegman%2C+Mitchell+Dale&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The happy judicialization of sexual rights: abortion and same sex marriage in mexico,"This project studies one of the most intense moments of the judicialization of Mexican politics: the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice’s intervention in the legal reforms on abortion and same sex marriage approved by the Legislative Assembly in Mexico City in 2007 and 2009. The cases stimulated the optimism of a transnational sexual rights agenda with images of progressive legal reforms and a responsive Court. But a study of the cases, it is argued here, reflects little engagement of the Supreme Court with human rights agendas of progressive images of judicial activism; instead, the momentum of judicialization speaks of a critical period of readjustment of authority in Mexico’s democratic institutions. Judicialization in Latin America is generally studied as the opening of constitutional courts to the citizenry and the establishment of tools for judicial review as the guarantor of constitutional rights in the new democracies. The Mexican experience of judicialization has been of a Court becoming the arbiter of conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of the government; it was historically initiated as a project to guarantee the stability of the political regime and the federal order. The Mexican Supreme Court evolved in democracy with a narrow formalist and self-constrained interpretation of human rights. The sexual rights cases were accepted by the Court when it was going through a compromising political period, and their successful decisions helped to moderate the legitimacy of the judicial tribunal, encouraging the attachment of social movements towards the Court, seen as a vehicle for social change. The thesis recognises sexual rights as a location of enunciation and production of subversive knowledge, generating intimate processes of subjective empowerment that inform new relationalities across a political sphere which includes legal culture. Sexual rights guide the study of the Court and the desire of a better trajectory of judicialization. The legal reforms and their judicial interventions are presented as optimistic promises, as signs that anticipated something good to come, even though they did not fully deliver against such hopes. Part 1 presents a theoretical frame to engage with optimism and promises, aiming to relate to the strategies of critical optimism with which one as a researcher can evaluate the conditions in which different people can relate (or not) to desired futures. Chapter 1 is a theoretical consideration of promises and optimism, chapter 2 presents the optimistic development in the new constitutionalism in Latin America embodied in constitutional moments, or constitutional reforms. Part II presents the political context that precedes the cases: first, in chapter 3, with the history of Mexico City and the institutionalisation of opposition, and then, in chapter 4, with the establishment of tools for constitutional review in the Supreme Court. Part II is dedicated to the case studies.",1779550439,,Dissertations & Theses," Sánchez García, ArturoSánchez GarcíaArturoSánchez García, Arturo", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015197671 , 103716122 , 101309 , 10083283 , 10083283 , http://kar.kent.ac.uk/48613/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779550439?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://kar.kent.ac.uk/48613/ , (UMI)AAI10083283 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+happy+judicialization+of+sexual+rights%3A+abortion+and+same+sex+marriage+in+mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=S%C3%A1nchez+Garc%C3%ADa%2C+Arturo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Charting material memories: an ethnography of visual and material transformations of woollen blankets in canada, aotearoa new zealand, and the united states","Taking one thing—the industrially produced woollen blanket—as an object of investigation, this thesis sets out to bring together a study of aesthetics, materiality, and locality in relation to the woollen blanket to consider it as a possible “technology of enchantment” (Gell 1998) in both its original and transformed states. This dissertation investigates the aesthetic transformations of the woollen blanket into art, craft, and Indigenous cultural property within our current historical moment and within specific abstract and concrete localities. Two distinct locations, Aotearoa New Zealand and North America, where such acts of transformation upon woollen blankets have had a sustained presence, are examined and compared. This project attempts to address how focusing upon the acts of transformation of materials makes visible a gap in the literature where more consideration into the movement and consumption of materials simultaneously in multiple locations is needed. The dynamism of multi-vocal and, yet, intensely local uses and transformations of woollen blankets reveal that movement and consumption are together a single transformative act. What results from these acts of transformation are both tangible and intangible values that will be described through case studies of use in order to draw out the imagined futurity of woollen blankets in their ‘renewed’ forms against their historical and colonial legacies. The varied values that emerge from distinct aesthetic transformations enable a new reading of the importance of aesthetic and creative manipulations of materials and matter that informs the local take-up of an industrial product. This thesis pushes beyond a current analytical framework that has considered how objects come to be entangled in local and global meanings through either their social life or biography. Instead this thesis focuses on the intentional transformations of materials that inform larger critical arguments around how both Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and communities fashion cultural knowledge and identity through soft materials that are themselves manifestations of the hard-edged, imperial, colonial, and industrial projects.",1782841683,,Dissertations & Theses," McDonald, F.

This was partly due to the effects of a global economic recession and arguably failed national economic structural adjustment programmes, rampant public sector corruption and a rise in authoritarianism, as states tried to keep restive populations under control. Zimbabwe saw intense political struggles between the government and various agents of social change who were pressing for democratic space. This study specifically investigates how the news media in Zimbabwe played a critical role in actively mobilizing for political change and as a site for opposition politics and agitation during moments of turmoil and repression from 1997-2010. Zimbabwe’s news media, particularly privately owned newspapers, provided more accessible platforms for robust debate that challenged the status quo in the troubled state. Not only did the private press in Zimbabwe successfully oppose the one-party state after the country attained independence in 1980, they were even more significant at the height of the economic and political governance crisis, also known as the Zimbabwe Crisis, from 2000-2010. My research focuses on the unprecedented ways in which newspaper journalism helped the cause of democratisation in Zimbabwe. The research is designed as a qualitative case study of The Daily News, a leading private newspaper whose masthead was aptly worded: “telling it like it is”. Apart from content illustration of purposely-selected headlines of newspaper articles, it was based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 51 respondents, who were mainly politicians and journalists living in Zimbabwe. I also draw upon my experience and observations of having worked for the Daily News during this eventful period. The research methods gave me access to primary data on the institutional and personal experiences of a private newspaper and its journalists, who reflected and affected the political crisis in Zimbabwe. The main aim was to investigate why and how news journalists working for a prominent private medium came to oppose an undemocratic state under conditions of repression. The analytical lens of alternative media facilitates a construction of how The Daily News and its journalists experienced, reported, confronted and navigated state authoritarianism in a historical moment of political turmoil. The study discusses the complex relationships between the independent and privately-owned press, the main opposition political party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and civil society organizations. Such groups include the labour movement and the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), the main constitutional reform movement. This dissertation argues that in the struggles for political change that ensued between the opposition forces and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party, The Daily News provided form and solidity to oppositional and civic voices that were previously shut out by the dominant public media. The significance of this study is that existing scholarship on media and communication studies in Zimbabwe do not adequately capture these experiences. The agency of such media institutions and journalists has rarely been investigated. Further, the research provides an original analysis of the operations of The Daily News and its journalists in the context of highly undemocratic political moment, inclusive of the trials and tribulations, such as assaults, arrests, detentions, and office bombings, civil and criminal trials. Arguably, this study fills an important lacuna in scholarship on the role of the news media in democratising states during moments of political instability. The study thus contributes to knowledge on the experiences of alternative, opposition, activist and often radical journalists in Zimbabwe, where they championed ordinary citizens’ stories instead of focussing entirely on expert views of the crisis. By embracing alternative media theory as the analytic lens of the study, there is arguably a normative contribution to knowledge through the use of the framework in a democratising context to broaden the understanding of the role of the news media in societies going through turbulent political transitions.",1782842400,,Dissertations & Theses," Runhanya, PedzisaiRunhanyaPedzisaiRunhanya, Pedzisai", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989352081 , 102698832 , 101309 , 10024540 , 10024540 , http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/14688/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1782842400?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/14688/ , (UMI)AAI10024540 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Alternative+media+and+african+democracy%3A+the+daily+news+and+opposition+politics+in+zimbabwe%2C+1997-2010&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Runhanya%2C+Pedzisai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Exploring the lifeworlds of community activists: an investigation of incompleteness and contradiction,"This research investigates the lifeworlds of community activists, paying particular attention to the issues of incompleteness and contradiction. My interest in the subject area arises from a three-fold context – the development of my own subjectivity; enhancement and understanding of work-based learning; and the impact of structural inequalities, privileges and hierarchies embedded within UK society. This study deploys a multi-site action research (MSAR) methodological framework to explore (auto)biographical accounts of activists’ working contexts. Using a combination of appreciative inquiry and Lacanian analysis, the methods of this research enable an investigation and impact analysis of how political difference is formulated, articulated and mobilised in landscapes, established and characterised by disparity of access, injustice and social struggle. Hence, having identified and celebrated the key contours of community activism, these findings are critiqued and placed within the wider turbo-capitalist context. In response to the aforementioned critique, this research concludes by exploring the opportunities and challenges faced by community activists in a global age. Particular focus is given to the issues of weakness, abeyance within social movements, cracks within the capitalist system, and anarchic readings and future developments of community activism.",1782842420,,Dissertations & Theses," Erskine, Christopher KeithErskineKeithChristopherErskine, Christopher Keith", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989361601 , 102698972 , 101309 , 10020779 , 10020779 , http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/13801/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1782842420?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/13801/ , (UMI)AAI10020779 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+lifeworlds+of+community+activists%3A+an+investigation+of+incompleteness+and+contradiction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Erskine%2C+Christopher+Keith&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Interconnected memories: left-wing terrorism in postmillennial german and italian cinema (2000-2010),"This thesis examines the representation of left-wing political violence in Italian and German films from 2000 to 2010 drawing on postmodernism theory, film genre, memory studies and gender theory. It considers filmic texts and paratexts, historiography and political discourses to offer a comparative analysis of the mnemonic dynamics in new millennial Italy and Germany. This thesis looks at why the experience of revolutionary terrorism in the 1970s reappears at the turn of the new millennium in a cluster of fiction films, which innovate and sometimes challenge previous paradigms. It reads this revival in connection with industrial trends and historical events, such as the end of old ideologies, the early release of former terrorists and 9/11. The memory of left-wing terrorism has found new lifeblood in the new millennium because there are ample resonances with contemporary social issues, such as political activism and global fears of international terrorism. Focusing on eight case studies, I argue that the memory of left-wing terrorism unfolds beyond and across temporal and spatial boundaries, reactivated by present-day occurrences and through contacts with other traumatic memories. The notion of ‘interconnected memory’ is fundamentally conceived as a nexus of multiple meanings, the fruit of past recollections, and movements between different socio-historical dimensions and generational memories. Representational strategies and narrative trends are also explored to shed light on crossnational forms of memorialising political violence and its legacy. The first part analyses how postmillennial films deal with the possibility of forgiveness, here interpreted as an approach to normalise the past through narratives of pacification or exclusion. It highlights the figure of the teenager as a metaphor for the changing memory of terrorism, generational conflicts and the implications of 1970s violence for young generations. Moreover, it discusses the depiction of female terrorists and the containment strategies adopted to mitigate the anxiety for terrorist acts perpetrated by violent women. The second part of this thesis is concerned with the risks of forgetting and more precisely on an aesthetic normalisation of the terrorist discourse through popular genres and a more commercial style. It comments on the hyper-authenticity and retro aesthetics in biopics about notorious terrorist groups, and the spectacularisation of violence via the thriller and heritage film genre. It also investigates how contemporary comedies satirise the phenomenon of anarchist revolts and political kidnappings to reflect on present-day social problems.",1784055358,,Dissertations & Theses," Caoduro, ElenaCaoduroElenaCaoduro, Elena", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017557581 , 103112762 , 101309 , 10045958 , 10045958 , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/374393/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784055358?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/374393/ , (UMI)AAI10045958 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interconnected+memories%3A+left-wing+terrorism+in+postmillennial+german+and+italian+cinema+%282000-2010%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Caoduro%2C+Elena&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""British and irish state responses to militant irish republicanism, 1968-1971","This thesis has as its focus the reactions of the British Government and the Government of the Republic of Ireland to the growth of militant Irish Republicanism and the deteriorating political and social situation in Northern Ireland, during the period 1968-1971. A granular analysis of the various agents of each state allows the complexity of the developing conflict to be shown. What emerges is a picture of strategy and policymaking which emanates from a range of different actors from political, diplomatic, military and civil service spheres. To date, studies of the period have tended to treat the respective states as monolithic; the approach here is to disaggregate, to allow the cross currents ' and purposes of policymaking and strategising, which served the differing agendas of individuals and departments within the states to be fully laid bare. The situation on the ground in Northern Ireland is the backdrop for all state activity, and the analpis offered here of power plays and internal dynamics within the Republican movement itself, shows that movement to be an evolving one during the period, and one which was afforded space to develop and expand by the management of the conflict by the respective states. Northern Ireland, a relative backwater in 1968, was pushed to the top of the political agenda in both Dublin and London, and was on the international stage by 1972. Extensive evidence from primary sources from this crucial period is presented here in an analysis of the activity of the Irish and British States, to gain an understanding of the processes in operation as they reacted to the rapidly-evolving events on the ground.",1792788730,,Dissertations & Theses," Rice, B.

Before the war, citizenship within east central European states stood above ethnic and linguistic categories yet, in an unstudied revolution that gripped the region after 1945, new political entities came into being that were predicated on homogeneous populations. I trace this process in Czechoslovakia and Poland, and use debates and laws regarding Jewish citizenship to understand the revolutionary changes of this time. The story begins in London and New York, where Poles and Czechs in diplomatic exile interacted with Allied governments and transnational Jewish organizations like the World Jewish Congress. Within these circles new ideas were forged concerning who constituted the Jewish people and where they belonged geographically. By 1944 and 1945 two distinct developments impelled key Czech, Polish and Jewish authorities to consider emigration away from Europe and towards Palestine as the most desirable option for east central Europe's Jewish citizens. First, the deadly extent of the Holocaust became increasingly public. And second, two high-profile meetings of the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) failed to produce a plan helping three groups of ""stateless"" European Jews who could not return to their pre-war ""homes"": Czechoslovak Jews who opted for German nationality before 1938, Jews from Subcarpathian Rus, and Polish Jews in the lands occupied and later annexed by the Soviet Union. Accordingly, the second half of my dissertation follows these three groups after liberation and examines laws and social policies in the postwar era that codified ethnic difference and facilitated Jewish migration elsewhere. Notably, Czechoslovak officials played a key role in helping many east central European Jews leave Europe by fashioning their state into a major transit point en route to Palestine. In sum, my dissertation shows how a deeper transformation of ideas concerning who belonged to a given nation-state under-girded broader political, economic and societal changes thus enabling the emergence of three new ethnic polities: Czechoslovakia, Poland and Israel. My dissertation makes important contributions to studies of the Jewish experience, east central Europe and the contours of citizenship in the twentieth century. First, it shows how an ""ethnic revolution,"" that took place among Allied leaders in exile, inspired new ideas about the Polish and Czechoslovak body politic and Jewish/Gentile coexistence thereby mandating massive population shifts as World War II ended. Usually, scholars think of the revolutions gripping east central Europe after 1945 as being political or economic, but in fact wartime shifts in ideas about ethnic belonging greatly influenced the course of the socialist revolution. Second, I showcase how the bricha, or semi-legal movement of Jews towards Palestine, can be linked to broader stories about Jewish citizenship, postwar state policies encouraging ethnic un-mixing and the massive population transfers that transpired in the wake of Germany's defeat. Finally, by illustrating how the possibilities for Jewish belonging narrowed over a short period and how a triad of ethnically homogenous states materialized, my work helps us better understand the prevalence of ethnically-defined nation-states.",1815773938,,Dissertations & Theses," Cramsey, Sarah AgnesCramseyAgnesSarahCramsey, Sarah Agnes", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4167215081 , 91596872 , 66569 , 9781369055009 , 10150734 , 10150734", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781369055009, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1815773938?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0335 European history , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0335 European history , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0335 European history , 0751 Judaic studies"," European history , Judaic studies"," Social sciences , Bricha , Czechoslovakia , Diplomacy , Holocaust , Poland , World jewish congress",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Uncertain+Citizenship%3A+Jewish+Belonging+and+the+Ethnic+Revolution+in+Poland+and+Czechoslovakia%2C+1938-1948&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cramsey%2C+Sarah+Agnes&amp;isbn=9781369055009&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Re-embodying leadership through a re-examination of the sacred,"The last couple of decades have witnessed an exponential increase of interest in religion and spirituality in the academic disciplines of leadership and organization. Some scholars argue that this interest is prone to neglect analysis of Western religion’s historical origins and therefore of what may be its repressed influences on leadership and organizational practices. Others, that this revived focus on the sacred may be limited by an over-reliance on too narrow a theology rooted within a singular (Judeo-Christian) cosmology. I seek to both speak to and expand the concerns of such previous research. I do this by introducing ecofeminism as a theoretical framework for a critical analysis of the macro level of what has already been framed as the repressed influence of mainstream religious orthodoxy within the field of leadership studies. Building upon the perspectives provided by ecofeminism and feminist spirituality I extend the aforementioned concerns by suggesting that some of the ethics within the Judeo-Christian cosmology itself bear some relationship to and responsibility in crises relating to environmental sustainability and social justice. I explore a number of related themes, arguing in particular that the demotion of nature and partnership with what might be described as the divine feminine within Western culture are not only linked but also generate profound dysfunction, in both leadership and organization. In the second section I present empirical data at a micro level, collected within a contemporary spiritual community where both nature and the divine feminine play central roles in its cosmology. The School of Movement Medicine functions as a financially successful business organization dedicated to the encouragement of spiritual fulfillment, ecological sustainability and social justice. The practices it teaches are specifically designed to assist those who engage with them to take responsibility for responding to the individual, societal and global challenges that lie before us - aiming, in other words to make leaders out of members. My hope is that these explorations may answer some of the calls of previous work to broaden representation within the leadership and spirituality field, as well as enriching its theory and practice with greater potential to generate increased levels of social justice, environmental sustainability and human fulfillment.",1827514755,,Dissertations & Theses," Young, Alison Margaret GriegYoungMargaret GriegAlisonYoung, Alison Margaret Grieg", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209455371 , 90007352 , 101309 , 10177560 , 10177560 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/16455", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827514755?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/16455 , (UMI)AAI10177560 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re-embodying+leadership+through+a+re-examination+of+the+sacred&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Young%2C+Alison+Margaret+Grieg&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The co-operative model town society: history, planning, architecture and social character of an indigenous garden suburb in colonial lahore","This thesis investigates the Co-operative Model Town Society Lahore; a town covering an area of around 2000 acres developed in the 1920’s in the (then) suburbs of Lahore, capital of Punjab province in British India. The Town is a remarkable interpretation of Ebenezer Howard’s Garden City ideals and the co-operative principles. However, the real significance of the town is it being a unique example of a co-operative garden town built by the local Indian bourgeois, majority of whom were forced to migrate due to the disturbances that followed after the declaration of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947. Despite the admiration and significance of the Town in the realm of pre and post-Independence Lahore, very little has been documented about it. Its formal documented history is non-existent while its original built environment, an excellent example to illustrate late-colonial architecture in the region, is diminishing rapidly due to negligence and reconstructions. The aim of this research is the documentation of history, urban form, social character and architecture of the pre-independence Model Town. Consequently, through an analysis of its built environment this study intends to develop an insight into the colonizer-colonized cultural transfers, in particular, to the transformation of British town planning ideas in the colonies due to their interpretation by the local Indians under the influence of prevalent religious, cultural and social practices. The research was conducted by the process of historical construction, whereby evidences from the documents and the built environment have been used collectively to develop the historiography of the town. The selection of primary material has been based on its availability as the documentary evidences are scattered across Pakistan, India and the UK. The built environment has been documented using the official drawings as well as onsite surveys and measurements where the original drawings are unavailable. The Town has been analysed in a comparative setting with respect to contemporary urban, architectural and social trends and practices prevalent locally ( both by the colonial rulers and the colonized natives) as well as global movements, especially Western ideologies and perspectives and their retrospect local adaptations. The documentation and analysis were used as a ground for four interpretative conclusions. The first conclusion elaborates on the need of urban historiography in Pakistan. The second conclusion interprets the Model Town in the realm of twentieth century urban planning in the region. The third conclusion elaborates on the colonial architectural styles. The fourth conclusion gives an insight into the Model Town with reference to western styled ‘Indian’ nationalism.",1827600204,,Dissertations & Theses," Anbrine, ShamaAnbrineShamaAnbrine, Shama", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209784381 , 102698782 , 101309 , 10177202 , 10177202 , http://repository.liv.ac.uk/2010879/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827600204?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://repository.liv.ac.uk/2010879/ , (UMI)AAI10177202 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+co-operative+model+town+society%3A+history%2C+planning%2C+architecture+and+social+character+of+an+indigenous+garden+suburb+in+colonial+lahore&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anbrine%2C+Shama&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"For 'getting it': an ethnographic study of co-operative schools,"The marketisation of the educational sector continues to shape educational provision, policy and practice on a worldwide scale (Apple, 2001; Ball, 2008; Giroux, 2004), ostensibly providing ‘freedom’ through the conflation of consumer ‘choice’ and ‘equality of opportunity’ via the invisible hand of the market. The assumption that competitive markets will produce better schools and outcomes for their students veils the extent to which a large proportion of the world’s population are positioned as marginal actors, unable to ‘compete’ or ‘choose’ as equals, as they engage on a significantly uneven playing field (Mills &amp; McGregor, 2014; Reay, 2012). Historical and global (cf. Fielding &amp; Moss, 2011; Neill, 1990; Wrigley et al., 2012) examples of democratic alternatives to the traditional institution of ‘the school’ have provided rich evidence of the radical possibilities for social change in the form of case studies and academic critique. However, the absence of a cohesive platform which allows a multiplicity of voices and diverse contexts to collaborate together and develop a more effective voice, risks positioning these more radical models at the fringe of educational reform. This represents a significant challenge for extending democracy within educational contexts. The co-operative movement represents a possible solution to this, especially in terms of developing its capacity to create a powerful alliance of partners which can reorient the means and ends of public education towards social justice. Indeed, in just six years co-operative schools have come to represent the third largest grouping within the English public education system (Munn, 2013) and in January 2014, there were just over 700 schools in the UK which have committed to adopting co-operative values (self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, solidarity, openness and honesty, social responsibility and caring for others) within the very heart of their school’s ethos (Shaw, forthcoming, 2015). Although the first English co-operative trust school opened in 2008, sustained analysis of this model has not been undertaken to date. Therefore, this research project attempts to offer the beginnings of a critical conversation that considers the possibilities and challenges that such a model of schooling might have to offer by undertaking a systematic examination of the recent emergence of a ‘co-operative’ model of public schooling from within the socio-historical context of decades of neoliberal educational ‘reforms’. This piece of research maps out how this model is variously conceived as a more ethical brand by some, and as a radical project which creates the necessary conditions for democracy and social justice to flourish by others. This research therefore, seeks to understand how tropes of “getting it” both constitute and confuse readings of freedom and equality in education as nascent understandings of co-operative school membership become slippery subjects of cooperative school discourse. By undertaking a critical discursive analysis of claims that co-operative school governance structures allow everyone to ‘have a say’, this thesis develops a theoretical engagement and provocation of ‘voice’ in education as it becomes increasingly troubled with and by attempts to answer the question, ‘what is a co-operative school?’ and ‘what can it do?’ In order to answer these questions, data drawn from critical ethnographic fieldwork undertaken at three co-operative trust and academy schools during 2012-13 was considered alongside discourse analysis of an emerging body of ‘texts’ that sought to inform and promote ‘co-operation’ in school. As a result of exploring the accounts of Others who offered a range of narratives that reflect the ‘making up’ (Hacking, 1990) of the co-operative subject, these different versions of events brought into view both the challenges and the possibilities that ‘cooperative’ schools and their members face; as the values and principles of cooperation are also shaped (but not necessarily determined) by claims made for equality which reflect the messiness of everyday school life. Furthermore, this piece of research highlighted the extent to which students’ experiences of “getting it” (cooperative schooling) troubled corresponding rights to be included in decision-making processes as the conditions of co-operative school membership are intersected by multiple axes of difference and inequality, both within educational discourse and in wider society. This research suggests that despite the promising emergence of a model of schooling that places a collective approach to civil society at its core, historical asymmetries of power and entrenched marketisation of educational provision and practice tended to prevail. This severely limited the extent to which schools were able to create the conditions of possibility for everyone to “get it” and ‘have a say’. I thus argue that, in order for co-operative schools to resist the neo-liberal appropriation of freedom through the lens of the ‘rational’ individual consumer of education, significant restructuring of governance arrangements is required alongside considerable advocacy work that addresses students’ rights to be included and protected as full members of the school community. This thesis closes with a number of observations and recommendations that contribute to reinvigorating the debate about what cooperative schooling can do, in addition to highlighting how this research project offers further insight about the conceptual and methodological dilemmas that work to shape the construction of children’s agency and subjectivities as students are variously positioned as heterogeneous subjects of co-operative education and educational research.",1857778156,,Dissertations & Theses," Davidge, GailDavidgeGailDavidge, Gail", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4299254051 , 103112782 , 101309 , 10302555 , 10302555 , http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/843/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1857778156?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/843/ , (UMI)AAI10302555 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=For+%27getting+it%27%3A+an+ethnographic+study+of+co-operative+schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davidge%2C+Gail&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Beyond Gender: A Translation of and Commentary on Anne F. Garréta's ""Sphinx""","This thesis comprises a translation from French to English of Anne F. Garréta’s novel Sphinx and a two-part critical introduction that puts the work into context and examines my translation method. My translation of Sphinx will make accessible to English-language readers a French text unique in both its style and message. A genderless love story, Sphinx enacts through the French language and French context a genderless vision of the world that is not immediately accessible to an English speaker. The first part of the introduction examines the work as taking inspiration from the methods of the écriture féminine movement of 1980s France—most notably as enacted through the works of Monique Wittig—and from the ideas of Roland Barthes, particularly his Fragments d’un discours amoureux . I also examine how the work uses linguistic constraint, solidifying Garréta’s place as a member of the experimental literary group Oulipo ( Ouvroir de littérature potentielle ), but simultaneously deviates from many other Oulipian texts by using linguistic constraint as a means to raise questions about society. In the second part of my introduction, I examine my translation process, including how I maintained the high literary style used throughout the text and how I avoided gender markers in English. My aim was to preserve the constraint in order to spread Garréta’s message—that gender difference is not an important or necessary determinant of our relationships or identities but is rather something constructed purely in the realm of the social, and therefore that the idea of gender difference is inane. I argue that translating this narrative for an American audience expands the validity of Garréta’s ideas to another culture as it allows for English readers to think about gender in a different way—a way that doesn’t revolve around the ideology of difference—by reading a book that creates a world of genderless amorous relations, a world that escapes the oppressive binary of male and female, a world created at the crossroads of French feminism, LGBTQ studies, and the Oulipo, a world that can help foster international discussion and ideas about identity.

Relations between Turkish Cypriots and the British on the one hand, and Greek Cypriots and the British on the other, were asymmetrical. During the colonial era in Cyprus, the Muslim community had undergone an enormous change in terms of national/ethnic identity and class characteristics. Turkish Cypriot nationalism developed belatedly as a militant nationalist and anti-Enosis movement. Against this background this thesis explores the relationship between the emergence of the Turkish national identity and the British colonial rule because the latter set out the international, political, social and ideological context wherein the Turkish national identity was shaped. In particular this thesis focusing on the period between the two World Wars (1923-1939) when the transformation of the Muslims of Cyprus into Turkish Cypriots occurred, examines the extent to which the British rule affected the process of development of Turkish nationalism on Cyprus. This thesis discusses educational and administrative policies implemented by the British rule that had an impact on the politics of the Muslim community of Cyprus. The development of Turkish Cypriot national identity is also placed in the broader international context of the Eastern Mediterranean, with due attention being paid to the role of both Turkey and Italy. The impact of the Kemalist reforms on Cyprus and the resultant division of Turkish Cypriots into two conflicting groups of Kemalists and traditionalists is presented, and British fears of Italian expansionism under Mussolini are also examined. The final conclusion is that while a Turkish Cypriot identity would inevitably have developed, the divisive way it developed was a result of the imperial policies the British rule implemented during the period in question.",1896107337,,Dissertations & Theses," Xypolia, IliaXypoliaIliaXypolia, Ilia", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322233493 , 103029842 , 101309 , 10595833 , 10595833", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896107337?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10595833 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contextualizing+the+emergence+and+the+development+of+turkish+nationalism+in+cyprus%3A+the+british+imperial+impact%2C+1923-1939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xypolia%2C+Ilia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Between the Magic of Magic and the Magic of Money: the Changing Nature of Experience in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta,"When people in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta are gathered around the hearths of their houses, it is common to hear the sound and movement of the women’s spindles whirring on the earth floor as they pull out threads of material, and the rhythm of men’s hardwood rods rubbing continuously against the mouth of their gourd containers. It is at this point of intimacy and flowing vitality at which the familiarity of the indigenous Sierra comes alive. According to Kogi, Wiwa and Ika cosmology, there is a life force that grows in people, as much as animals and plants, which like the thread of a spindle extends from the center of the cosmos. “It is here where the Universal Mother planted her gigantic spindle across the highest peak,” as she said: “this is Kalusankua, the central post of the world.” This vital thread, like an umbilical cord, holds all living elements as they fulfill their fate on Earth. It is a very different strand from the one that Walter Benjamin mentions in the story of the genie who gave the boy a ball of thread and said: “This is the thread of your life. Take it. When you find time heavy on your hands, pull it out; your days will pass quick or slow, according as you unwind the ball rapidly or little by little. So long as you leave the thread alone, you will remain stationary at the same hour of your existence.” But the boy started pulling the thread and before he knew it he became a man, married the girl he loved, saw his children grow up, passed over his anxieties, lived honors and profits, and then cut short his old age, all in four months and six days. Pre-Columbian materials -many times sonorous and full of detailed expressions; made of gold and copper, ceramic, jade and stone quartz of different luster and color- are said to be the medium through which people, plants and animals are able to concentrate the necessary life force to fulfill their fate on Earth. Buried all around the vast mountainous terrain of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, these ancient materials sustain the interconnections to the creative energies in the cosmos. However, as these materials are looted and pulled out of ancient indigenous grounds, they cease to hold together the center from which this vital force grows. As they are sold as commodities, they appear in the international art market, independent of their place of origin and devoid of any life force. With the new modes of industrial production, observes Karl Marx, the creative energy or central force of people disappears in the things that they produce. Matter severed from its producer acquires a second life independent of its source of energy and equivalent to all other things in the form of commodities. As capitalist societies begin to measure the output of energy in terms of this second life of things, individual skills and creative energies become irrelevant to the process of growth. “The individuals are now subordinated to social production, which exists externally to them, as a sort of fate,” notes Marx in the Grundrisse in 1857. Walter Benjamin then extends this idea and points out: “In ‘fate’ is concealed the concept of ‘total experience.’” He quotes the following passage in The Arcades Project: “It is not a question of ‘the triumph of mind over matter’…; rather, it represents the triumph of the rational and general principles of things over the energy and qualities proper to the living organism.” Even though Pre-Columbian materials are not produced in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta today, they are believed to mediate the energies and qualities proper to living beings. These energies are lost as they are dug out, and as the holes in the Mother Land of the Ika, Wiwa and Kogi people grow, so does the value of these pieces in the market. It is only in the realm of the inorganic that we can begin to fathom this concept of value. Walter Benjamin’s notion of a “new kind of 20th C fate” helps us observe this vast contradiction now lived in the native Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, whereby the threads that like umbilical cords connect living beings throughout their life to the sources of energy around their territory, no longer seem to be growing out of experience but rather out of money.

It studies the project's conceptual arc, shifting ontology, discourses, institutions, practices, and technologies in their interrelatedness to constitute a new Iraq. It is an ethnography of a thixotropic regime of law and order in translation; a circuit through various landscapes and temporalities to narrate the 1991 war, the institutionalization of sanctions and inspection regimes, material transformations within the American military, the 2003 war and finally the nation-building processes as a continuous and unitary project. The dissertation makes three central arguments: First, the 2003 war on Iraq was imagined through intricate and fluid spaces and temporalities. Transforming Iraq into a democratic regime has served as a catalyst for transforming the American military organization and the international legal system. Second, this project has reordered the spatialized time of Iraq by the imposition of models in translation, reconfigured and reimagined through a realm of violence. These models have created in Iraq a regime of differential mobility, which was enabled through an ensemble of experts, new institutions and calculative technologies. Third, this ensemble took Iraq as its object of knowledge and change rendering Iraq and Iraqis into a set of abstractions within the three spaces under examination: the space of American military institutions; the space of international legality within the United Nations; and, lastly, the material space of Baghdad. Part one examines the pre-invasion political, military, and legal practices that enabled the 2003 invasion and the so-called nation-building projects that ensued. In the American military space, the dissertation focuses on the 1991 and the 2003 military campaigns and operations and traces both campaigns in Iraq in terms of discourses of spatialization and temporalization to historicize the emergences of the so-called 'revolution in military affairs' and its progression to a full-fledged theory of cyber-war renowned as network-centric warfare (NCW). In the UN space, this dissertation studies the forms of sovereignty that emerged through the political, legal, and military processes of the 1990s and early 2000s. The 1991 military campaign; post-1991 deployment of the United Nations' authority in order to establish, as an institution, the sanctions and inspection regimes; the 2003 invasion itself; and, finally, the re-siting of the Iraqi Archive: These events are the work of various technologies of violence and control which led to extensive asymmetrical movements of people and things in and about Iraq resituating the sovereignty of the state not within the territorial borders of Iraq but at the level of the globe. Part two studies the post-invasion regime of law and order imposed by the American occupation, its role in reconfiguring the architectural and social space of Baghdad, the identity of the city's population, and the persistent crisis in which the city was subsumed. The Iraqi legal system was flattened and remade with speed and intensity as a prerequisite for a new democratic Iraq creating a new set of laws to be administered by reorganized government institutions, and a new lexicon of political categories that has divided the city's population and mapped them onto the divided city-scape. In Bagdad's urban space, architectural barriers, empowered by new technologies of surveillance, targeting and identifications, have become a permanent element of the post-invasion system as spatial signifiers of law and order.",1666454331,,Dissertations & Theses," Shaheen, AbeerShaheenAbeerShaheen, Abeer", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3635117611 , 94961042 , 66569 , 9781321613933 , 3685396 , 3685396", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321613933, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1666454331?accountid=14496," 0422 Philosophy , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0422 Philosophy , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0422 Philosophy , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0422 Philosophy , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," Philosophy , Middle Eastern Studies , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American project , Counterinsurgency , Democracy , Institutions , Insurgency , Iraq , Violence , War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Dictatorship+to+Democracy%3A+Iraq+under+Erasure&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shaheen%2C+Abeer&amp;isbn=9781321613933&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Immigrant Labor in Contemporary Southern Literature, 1980-2010","This dissertation project emerges from an interest in immigrant labor, the globalization of southern literature, and the ways in which laboring bodies, specifically those of food processing workers, casino workers and motel workers, are represented in contemporary literary and cultural productions. Literary and cultural productions about immigrants and immigrant labor aim to problematize and challenge the dominant perception of immigration and narratives of immigration that continue to perpetuate ideas of exploitation and alterity. In doing so, these texts contribute to the reconstruction of the U.S. South as a global region and to the liberation of southern literature from traditional conceptual models that reinforce its insularity and exceptionality. The introduction of this project argues for a different way of reading immigrant narratives that deconstruct binaries in the region in order to situate new immigrant narratives as contributing to the extension of the boundaries and borders of the southern literature. Here the movement of people across constructed national boundaries is no longer situated between spatially and temporally differentiated areas, but instead is seen as taking place within a global system. The contemporary cultural productions analyzed in the dissertation provide varying representations of immigrant labor and labor exploitation and include works of literature and a film. The first chapter examines the ways in which the contemporary immigrant narrative is employed in the novel Holy Radishes! by Roberto G. Fernández in order to trace the perpetuation of labor exploitation through exiled female employees of a food processing plant in Florida. Chapter two provides an analysis of Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full and focuses on the novel's rendering of undocumented immigrant workers in food processing plants and its challenges to the ideological and social perceptions of immigrant labor. The third chapter focuses on representations of immigrant labor, which is performed in the public sphere of the casino industry in Cynthia Shearer's The Celestial Jukebox . The final chapter analyzes Mira Nair's film Mississippi Masala and concentrates on the labor of Indian motel workers addressing, as in the previous chapters, deep-rooted labor history and historical labor traumas in the region.",1672951879,,Dissertations & Theses," Altindis, HuseyinAltindisHuseyinAltindis, Huseyin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3654127941 , 95379702 , 66569 , 9781321666229 , 3688230 , 3688230", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321666229, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1672951879?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Alterity , Hybridity , Immgration , Liminality , Multiculturalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Immigrant+Labor+in+Contemporary+Southern+Literature%2C+1980-2010&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Altindis%2C+Huseyin&amp;isbn=9781321666229&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Rule of Sanctuary: Security, Nature, and Norms in the Protected Forests of Kerala, South India","The aim of this dissertation is to understand how worries over nature’s degradation, ensuing securitization practices, and emergent norms intersect in environmental protected areas. It concerns the Nilgiri Biosphere in Kerala, South India, and how regimes of nature protection effect the lives of its human inhabitants, the Kurumba, a so-called primitive adivasi tribe. Combining ethnography with archival research, it asserts that the labors and logics of nature protection, present and past, participate in a distinctly liberal problematic of competing securities, manifest in the tension between sovereign discretions and the freedoms of legal rights and market interests. This study makes two overarching claims. First, that during the colonial era, nature’s inessential character allowed for flexibilities in legal interpretation that furthered imperial ambitions. In the silence of the law, norms mediated by colonialist pejoratives operated to satisfy those ambitions, while supplementing the knowledge necessary for government. Second, analysis of recent environmental movements and ecological projects surrounding the Nilgiri Biosphere shows how norms derived from civil society are produced to intervene between security prerogatives and social freedoms. The upshot of these normative practices, I argue, is to depoliticize natures and agencies, while extending and intensifying security’s command of unruly natures. While ensuring lives lived in accordance to it, this normativity endangers those who fall short of or otherwise elude it. To understand this endangerment, I provide an interpretation of adivasi resistances and rejections, in particular the Kurumba turn to illicit cultivation of ganja in the Biosphere’s core area. I contextualize this turn within the history of forest-adivasi relations, recent adivasi actions elsewhere within the Nilgiri Biosphere, and the global discourses of indigenous peoples and the environment. I argue that by operating not through a putative politics of rights and interest, but through counter-conducts and illegalities, the Kurumba present a challenge to the political as such.",1680843164,,Dissertations & Theses," Gajula, GoutamGajulaGoutamGajula, Goutam", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3684562371 , 92775132 , 66569 , 9781321716801 , 3701185 , 3701185", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321716801, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1680843164?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0332 History , 0392 Environmental philosophy"," Cultural anthropology , History , Environmental philosophy"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , India , Kerala , Nature , Protected forests , Sanctuary , Security",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Rule+of+Sanctuary%3A+Security%2C+Nature%2C+and+Norms+in+the+Protected+Forests+of+Kerala%2C+South+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gajula%2C+Goutam&amp;isbn=9781321716801&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Black Like Me? A Narrative Study of Non-Anglophone Black U.S. Immigrant Selves in the Making,"The passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act abolished discriminatory national origin quotas that favored European immigrants. The U.S. has since experienced steady flows of immigrants of color. These diverse groups have brought their racial, social, cultural and historical experiences, which adds greater complexity to the existing Black/White and ingroup/outgroup models that shape group relations, and psychological theorizing about identity. This dissertation focuses specifically on the smaller, less visible, yet growing segments of these immigrant populations. It presents a study of the lives of ten individual immigrants of African descent originating from a non-Anglophone country within Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Using a narrative identity framework, informed by critical race and cultural theories, life story interviews were conducted. The objectives of this inquiry were threefold. First, this study sought to understand how diverse groups of individuals construct, and make-meaning of their identity development while situating each life within a global/local and temporal context. Specific attention was devoted to the formative role played by historical experiences, different cultures, migration, and the power dynamics framing the varied localities of each individual's development. Also considered was the specific influence other individuals and groups have had in shaping conceptions of self/others. Second, this study documents how being Black and an immigrant is socially and subjectively experienced within race, and across differences in ethnicity and nationality. Third, this study explores the distinct changes, opportunities and difficulties each individual negotiates as his/her hybrid racial and cultural identity challenge dominant stereotypes and static conceptions of group identity. The findings highlight nuances in meaning-making and in narrative constructions of self. For this dissertation, two sets of narratives emerged. One small group constructed narratives focused on the historical, cultural and political nature of racial identity and its intersections with class, gender and nationality--illustrating the influence that social location plays in navigating different environments marked by power dynamics.

While the immediate postwar years gave rise to a germanophone literature that was largely intolerant of formal experimentation—due to widespread adherence to a neo-Sartrean model of littérature engagée and a restorationist return to classical form—certain writers began to oppose this aesthetic conservatism in the early fifties. Influenced by international avant-garde developments—from concrete poetry to the nouveau roman —they developed a new form of German writing that actively experimented with literary and linguistic form. Their work was often accompanied by a sophisticated theoretical critique of language, connecting back via Wittgenstein and Whorf to the turn-of-the-century Sprachkrise and the writings of Mauthner and Hofmannsthal. I aim to offer an analysis of this language-skeptical approach to writing, showing how it was employed to create a cultural space for avant-garde literature in the postwar period—presenting experimental writing as a legitimate intellectual endeavor with tangible social value, despite its running contrary to prevalent models of politically engaged or formally conservative writing. Against the common literary-historical view of the sixties as the decade of the ""politicization of literature,"" I aim to show the existence of an alternate track of ""linguistic aesthetics"" propagated almost exclusively by writers of experimental literature, developing in the fifties and extending through the sixties and beyond. For these writers, a skeptical and analytical treatment of language became the necessary starting point for any progressive literature. I also aim to show how later writers like Handke and Brinkmann came to see this linguistic skepticism as en encumbering limitation of literary possibility. In their early-seventies work, which is often grouped with the movement of New Subjectivity, these writers adopt a pragmatic model of language as a flawed but functional tool for the communication of subjective experience, resulting in a writing that continues to explore the ambiguous link between word and world.",1699085558,,Dissertations & Theses," Davis, NathanielDavisNathanielDavis, Nathaniel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3759215171 , 97951582 , 66569 , 9781321850727 , 3709443 , 3709443", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321850727, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1699085558?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0311 Germanic literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0311 Germanic literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0311 Germanic literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0311 Germanic literature"," Comparative literature , Germanic literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Aesthetics , Avant-garde , Language , Linguistics , Literature , Postwar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+limits+of+literary+language%3A+Linguistic+skepticism+and+literary+experiment+in+postwar+Germany+and+Austria&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davis%2C+Nathaniel&amp;isbn=9781321850727&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Essays on Emigration and Politics,"This dissertation provides new theory and evidence on the relationship between emigration and politics through three related essays. In the first essay, I examine the relationship between migration and political change using evidence from Mexico's twentieth-century agrarian reform. The agrarian reform was a transformative redistributive program that began during a time of high emigration between Mexico and the United States. These migration patterns were interrupted by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. Using a research design similar to a difference-in-differences approach, I show that there was a large differential acceleration in land redistribution in high- relative to low-emigration states after the closure of the U.S. labor market during the Depression. Drawing on historical research from archival and secondary sources, I argue that this acceleration can be traced to the effect of ongoing emigration in reducing social pressure for reform during the 1920s and to the role of repatriates in the agrarian movement during the Depression. In the second essay, I present a theoretical model to illuminate some of the political tensions over emigration policy, focusing on the effect of exit options on citizen coordination. The global-games model highlights two mechanisms through which emigration opportunities can reduce political mobilization: those with access to emigration options are less likely to participate in collective action given their profitable exit opportunities, and the common knowledge that some citizens have access to exit options reduces everyone's confidence that collective action can be successful. As a result, all citizens become less likely to mobilize, making successful collective action less likely. In the third essay, I examine the impact of emigration on public service provision using household- and community-level data from contemporary Mexico. I use an instrumental-variables empirical strategy based on the role of pre-existing transportation and migrant networks in facilitating future emigration from a household or community. I show that, though emigration increases the wealth of sending households and communities, the relationship between migration and public services is ambiguous. I present some empirical evidence that the positive wealth impacts of migration might be offset by its adverse impacts on community governance.",1700219804,,Dissertations & Theses," Sellars, Emily A.SellarsA.EmilySellars, Emily A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3763691271 , 96259052 , 66569 , 9781321911640 , 3714099 , 3714099", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321911640, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1700219804?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science"," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science"," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science",," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science"," Economics , Political science"," Social sciences , Development economics , Mexican politics , Migration , Political economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+Emigration+and+Politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sellars%2C+Emily+A.&amp;isbn=9781321911640&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Peace with justice through the eyes of Palestinians living in their historic homeland,"Since 1948, voices of Palestinian civil society have mostly been absent from the media as have debates about how to resolve their grievances and overall situation of life under the constraints imposed by Israel. This dissertation was intended to provide a venue for those voices to be heard to cultivate a clearer understanding of how Palestinians would address the conflict, occupation and overall historical and contemporary circumstances of their economic social, cultural and global situation. A context of Palestinian history and culture is provided. Face-to-face interviews and observations were conducted in October and November 2012 of Palestinian Arabs living in the West Bank, Occupied East Jerusalem and Gaza. This study addressed the core research question: What do Palestinians living in their historic homeland define and envision as a peaceful and just solution to the current situation in Palestine/Israel? It provides an alternative to speculation offered by the media, politicians and others as to what Palestinian civil society wants or needs as a final resolution to the ongoing conflict. The analysis of the study results reveals that none of those asked were strongly in favor of the two-state option. Only two even mentioned it. Both did not prefer it, but would accept it if offered as the only choice to end the occupation. Palestinian unity was very much on the minds of all participants with little support for current leadership. It was often difficult for participants to envision anything except the current paradigm under occupation. For the most part they want what freedom of movement, the ability to earn a living, to live their lives without being controlled by Israel, Egypt and the United States. Most importantly they want the world to hear their voices, understand the reality of their lives under occupation with the hope that will bring an end to the current paradigm and their suffering.",1707929034,,Dissertations & Theses," Nassor, DonnaNassorDonnaNassor, Donna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3791106571 , 94328062 , 66569 , 9781321897661 , 3712746 , 3712746", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321897661, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707929034?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0451 Social psychology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0451 Social psychology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0451 Social psychology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0451 Social psychology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Religious history , Middle Eastern history , Social psychology , Middle Eastern Studies , Ethnic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Psychology , Nakba , Occupation , Palestine , Palestinians , Peace , Zionism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Peace+with+justice+through+the+eyes+of+Palestinians+living+in+their+historic+homeland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nassor%2C+Donna&amp;isbn=9781321897661&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Military urbanism and the government of risk in post-9/11 Oakland,"Over the better part of the last decade, urban control and policing techniques in the United States have become increasingly militarized. This paper contends that such events are best understood as being situated within the emergence of a resurgent “military urbanism” — a broad set of military and security discourses, procedures and technologies initially deployed in the neo-colonial frontiers of Iraq or Afghanistan — which is now significantly reshaping urban space and governance in the “homelands” of the West. In the city of Oakland, these processes have been spurred by concerns over sharp increases in violent crime and the escalating militancy of recent political uprisings, resulting in the intensified policing of historically marginalized populations and the brutal demobilization of mass political movements. Using the city of Oakland between the years of 2003-2014 as a case study this paper argues that while these still-developing strategies have been deployed under various guises of violent crime prevention and counter-terrorism, these measures function to secure against the attendant structural instability and social unrest caused by recent domestic and global financial crises.

Since the 1980s, this market has expanded, fueled by local projects of cultural renewal and global interests in postcolonial art and creative resources. First Nations cultural activists have intervened into Canadian politics of recognition, demanding sovereign rights that diverge from official policies of multiculturalism to enable greater control over territories and resources. Taking up the fluid categories of contemporary art - its potential for participatory practice, political intervention, and play - a new generation of Native artists are challenging modernist and secularist models of art's efficacies, imagining different ways that aesthetics and politics can comingle in Indigenous practice and sovereignty. Based on two years of research with First Nations artists and cultural producers in British Columbia, as well as other locations of contemporary Indigenous art in Canada, this dissertation is an archival and multi-sited ethnographic inquiry into the discursive production of Northwest Coast-style art. Documenting artists' practices, contexts of display, and deployments of art and agency that expand on traditional object-based protocols, I analyze the modalities of the contemporary that artists propose in imagining the past, present, and future of sovereignty—visions that may challenge neoliberal models of cultural property and critical histories of contemporary art, as artists simultaneously draw on and intervene into deep complicities between art and extraction in the preservation of cultural resources. Contributing to understandings of global contemporary art and contemporaneity as a temporal and spatial condition, this dissertation emphasizes how artists navigate this terrain in dialogue with histories of the art market, formalist obligations, and social and environmental movements. Throughout, I argue for an understanding of First Nations art practices as sovereign political interventions into the unsettled conditions, values, and spaces of both Native—non-Native relations in British Columbia and of contemporary art.",1710796008,,Dissertations & Theses," Kisin, Eugenia CarolKisinCarolEugeniaKisin, Eugenia Carol", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3803303621 , 94994182 , 66569 , 9781321954395 , 3716549 , 3716549", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321954395, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1710796008?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0740 Native American studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0740 Native American studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0740 Native American studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0740 Native American studies"," Cultural anthropology , Native American studies"," Social sciences , British Columbia , Canada , Contemporary art , First Nations , Indigeneity , Northwest coast",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unsettled+Aesthetics%3A+First+Nations+Art+and+Acts+of+Sovereignty+on+the+Northwest+Coast&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kisin%2C+Eugenia+Carol&amp;isbn=9781321954395&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A Model of Dance/Movement Therapy for Resilience-building in People Living with Chronic Pain: A Mixed Methods Grounded Theory Study,"Awareness of pain as a multifaceted phenomenon is growing and more people are seeking complementary and alternative medicine or psycho-therapeutic approaches for chronic pain management. Furthermore, the significance of positive health concepts focusing on individuals’ strength within the context of adversity, such as resilience, has been recognized in chronic pain management. However, contemporary pain management strategies as well as existing resilience models have largely been neglecting a fundamental component of the experience of chronic pain and its rehabilitation, namely embodiment. This study aimed at examining how Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT), an embodiment and enaction-based psycho-therapeutic approach, may help people living with chronic pain to foster resilience through the corporeal experience of the moving body. To answer the question, “What theoretical model grounded in qualitative and quantitative data may explain the therapeutic factors and mechanisms of DMT for resilience building in people living with chronic pain?” an innovative multiphase Mixed Methods Grounded Theory (MM-GT) study was developed and conducted. In phase I, a substantive model was generated based on the findings from two sets of data collection and analysis processes, namely meta-modeling and reflexive GT. Based on these findings, a 10-week group DMT intervention was designed and appropriate quantitative outcome measures were determined. In phase II, the substantive model was tested quantitatively and qualitatively during the clinical intervention. The quantitative and qualitative findings were then compared and integrated to generate a clinical model. Through integrating the models from the two phases, a refined final composite model was constructed. The quantitative findings showed that there was statistically significant change in resilience ( p &lt;. 001), kinesiophobia ( p =. 031), attention regulation , a subscale from body awareness ( p =. 016), and pain intensity ( p =. 03) after the 10-week intervention. The Patient’s Global Impression of Change score indicated that about 70% of the participants felt moderately to a great deal better after the treatment. The immediate effect of DMT sessions on mood, stress, relaxation, and pain was also tested significant with p &lt;. 001 for all outcomes. Correlation analysis confirmed that there is a statistically significant relationship between body awareness and self-efficacy ( p &lt;. 0001). The final GT model shows that the DMT process involves dynamic interactions between various factors that facilitate the intricate mechanisms of DMT to foster resilience resources for chronic pain management. The overall phenomenon is a process of breaking free from the rigidity and imprisoned state created by the overpowering impact of chronic pain toward regaining control over pain and one’s life. DMT provides a novel environment for creative self-exploration and interactions, and mobilizes people to loosen up at all levels – physical, cognitive, emotional, and social. Key therapeutic mechanisms include activating self-agency, connecting to self, connecting to others, enhancing emotional intelligence, and reframing . Several moderator factors were identified namely person factors (i.e., peer support and therapist support) and therapy factors (i.e., self-directive structure, optimal level of challenge, music, and home practice). A set of contextual conditions were also identified namely activity level, alexithymia, % of time in pain, social support, other life stressors, and engagement with the psycho-therapeutic aspects of the treatment. Therapy outcomes include being in-control, integration, emotional health, plasticity, and readiness to engage with outside world. As a result, people experienced new ways of living in their body and being in the world. Based on the findings, several theoretical, clinical and methodological implications as well as suggestions for future research are proposed. The process and outcome of the study confirmed that MM-GT is an effective research method for generating and testing a theoretical model that can describe complex data.",1718419327,,Dissertations & Theses," Shim, MinjungShimMinjungShim, Minjung", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3824924611 , 98151072 , 66569 , 9781339008226 , 3720108 , 3720108", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339008226, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718419327?accountid=14496," 0382 Physical therapy , 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0569 Nursing , 0622 Clinical psychology"," 0382 Physical therapy , 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0569 Nursing , 0622 Clinical psychology"," 0382 Physical therapy , 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0569 Nursing , 0622 Clinical psychology",," 0382 Physical therapy , 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0569 Nursing , 0622 Clinical psychology"," Physical therapy , Behavioral psychology , Nursing , Clinical psychology"," Psychology , Health and environmental sciences , Chronic pain managment , Creative arts therapy , Dance/movement therapy , Grounded theory , Mind body medicine , Mixed methods research",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Model+of+Dance%2FMovement+Therapy+for+Resilience-building+in+People+Living+with+Chronic+Pain%3A+A+Mixed+Methods+Grounded+Theory+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shim%2C+Minjung&amp;isbn=9781339008226&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Return migration of British retirees living in Marina Alta Region (Spain),"Return migration has been historically a neglected aspect of migration processes. Even now when Spain has gone from being a country characterized by sending emigrants, then a receiving country and back again, it is not easy to find academic analysis on return processes. In the case of the British retired population, return migration after retirement analysis gets complicated by several factors, among which there is the fact that quite often these migrations are considered by the host society as touristic movements and also the generalization of wealth among the community. This thesis presents an analysis of return migration after a retirement migration of British citizens in the region of the Marina Alta (Alacant). Using approaches as the International Retirement Migration, Lifestyle Migration and core migration theories, we consider a triple approach to an invisible phenomenon with very little evidence. Data from Continuous Register Statistics and the Residential Variations Statistics and the Population Information System is used. Secondly, an approach to the return intentions as they are expressed by the group of British residents in the Marina Alta territory has been studied. These opinions were collected through an electronic survey conducted during the months of August to October 2014. Finally we used semifocused interviews with 30 informants that are people in touch with the group of residents and who are offering their point of view both of the British residents’ return process as well as the difficulties they face. The main results of this study are, in first place, that the British return movement from Marina Alta to the UK has been growing in recent years, with major peaks in 2010 and 2013, and it is expected a growing trend in the next few years. Several reasons explain this trend: on the one hand the gradual aging of the group, mostly arrived between 1999 and 2006. On the other hand, the effects of the crisis, among which there is the expected difficulty to sell the properties acquired hoping that they would assure a wealthy retirement, which in result, would accelerate the sale process, even taking losses against the initial investment. Another factor to consider is the comparison of costs and benefits between the services offered by the Spanish welfare system, cut to a minimum in its practical application under the “Dependency Law” in the Valencian Country, and a liberal system, although with a high range coverage in the case of the UK. And last, but not least, there is the administrative depuration of the register, which has undergone in the last few years. Second, it has to be noted that the group of British residents in the Marina Alta mostly express their desire to remain in the region, thus denying his desire to return. 29% of the surveyed sample expressed their desire to return to a higher amount than others return intention measures observed in similar territories. In addition, a significant portion of the population moves between return and remain intentions, which leads us to consider the weak migration planning with the consequences this may have for an aging and sometimes vulnerable population. Finally, the discourse analysis of semifocused interviews provides an overview on the return process, in some way opposed to the canons of research on retirement migration. On the one hand, because of the difficulties faced when the group has to perform an assisted return under unfavourable conditions in terms of health or finances. On the other hand, because of the helping ways that the expats found regardless of autonomous return or family helped return, basically managed by local or British charities, or by a combination of both. Given the results, this research suggests the need to take measures to normalize the residence of British population in the Marina Alta and, by extension, in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the rest of Spain. These measures have to go through the need to legalize the residence in Spain, with tight controls in the registers and, in particular, an increase in the effort to ensure the proper administrative and statistical monitoring of migrations and a greater involvement of the UK authorities. Moreover, we should introduce measures to promote the exchange of information between authorities, not only on economic and tax matters, but also to reduce the fraud and misuse of health and social services, and to have real information of migratory processes, and ultimately facilitate a return process that sometimes can become calamitous. Finally, there should be a greater involvement of the British government, not only in control and information, but also in ensuring health and social welfare among their residents.

Out of this process emerged new relationships between people and the environment, ecological questions of disease, land, and water management, and novel forms of social interaction. This dissertation examines that frontier ecology in Cilicia, a borderlands region of the Eastern Mediterranean situated at the historical juncture of Anatolia and Syria. Centered on the city of Adana, the Çukurova delta plain was home to small urban and village communities along with transhumant pastoralists who used the plain for winter pasture at the mid-19th century. The people of Cilicia migrated to the mountains during the summer to beat the heat, graze their flocks, and avoid the risk of malaria in the marshy lowlands. Following the Crimean War, this ecology of transhumance began to change through the expansion of cotton cultivation, the arrival of tens of thousands of Muslims migrants, and the forced settlement of pastoralists. Wheat, cotton, and sesame took over the former swamps and pastures. Settlers grappled with epidemic malaria as they sought to make a living on a sparse, fertile, and uneven plain. The seasonal migrations of pastoralists slowly gave way to the seasonal migration of agricultural laborers. And the region's center of gravity drifted from the mountains to the plain. This process has been narrated through the various lenses of modernization, nationalism, imperialism, and global economic transformation, but this study approaches the remaking of Cilicia from the vantage point of vital issues in the quotidian life of its inhabitants from the late Ottoman period onward. This is the story of the people of Cilicia and their ever-changing relationship with the environment over the course of a century. It uncovers the activities of Muslim and Christian villagers and merchants, the journeys of immigrants from the Caucasus, the Balkans, and Crete, the labors of Arab, Kurdish, Armenian and Assyrian seasonal workers, and the enduring movements of pastoralists and their flocks. It studies how state and society confronted unique ecological questions like malaria that arose out of settlement. It explores a world born of rapid agrarian change, which became the stage for tales of economic triumph, physical struggle, and communal contention over access to land and resources. This study follows these themes through the tumultuous years of WWI and into the Republic of Turkey, tracing the shifts and continuities between the late Ottoman period and the post-WWII mechanization of agriculture and transport and the near elimination of malaria. In order to achieve a multivocal narrative, this dissertation draws on a wide source base from different state and non-state archives in Turkey, France, the US, the UK, and Lebanon as well as periodicals and published sources in a number of languages, especially Ottoman/Modern Turkish and Armenian. Perspectives from literature and folklore add further texture to this picture of agrarian change in a region of the modern Middle East.",1720163061,,Dissertations & Theses," Gratien, ChristopherGratienChristopherGratien, Christopher", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3830532011 , 96041722 , 66569 , 9781339057934 , 3723138 , 3723138", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339057934, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1720163061?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0477 Environmental Studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0477 Environmental Studies"," Middle Eastern history , Environmental Studies"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Disease , Migration , Ottoman empire , Pastoralism , Syria , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+mountains+are+ours+Ecology+and+settlement+in+late+Ottoman+and+early+Republican+Cilicia%2C+1856-1956&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gratien%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781339057934&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Green Accessibility: Estimating the Environmental Costs of Space-time Prisms for Sustainable Transportation Planning,"Accessibility is a concept that describes the ease to reach facilities, resources, and services (collectively called opportunities) within an environment. Increasing mobility (the ease of movement) is one way to achieve greater accessibility. However, mobility may also result in environmental costs such as fossil fuel consumption, emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants, and noise pollution. In recent years, a paradigm shift from mobility toward accessibility has emerged as part of a move toward sustainable transportation. A widely applied measure of accessibility is the space-time prism (STP). It demarcates all locations that an individual can be present in space and time while travelling from an origin to a destination given a time budget and maximum travel speed. For accessibility within transportation networks, the network-time prism (NTP) accounts for additional constrains such as one-way restrictions and posted speed limits. Therefore, prism-based accessibility measures are sensitive to socio-economic backgrounds of individuals and changes in land-use and transportation system. However, there is an assumption in transportation applications that larger prisms are better since they can provide more accessibility benefits to individuals. This ignores the fact that larger prisms also indicate greater mobility and may hereby bring higher environmental costs. Moreover, existing research have only used the prism boundary to delimit accessible locations and times from inaccessible locations and times, and ignored that locations and times within the prism may not be equally accessible. This theoretical and methodological weakness limits the ability to estimate the potential environmental and social costs associated with STPs and NTPs. This dissertation develops theory and methods to estimate environmental costs of prisms for the use in sustainable transportation planning. It develops an analytical theory for estimating the environmental costs of a prism, specifically, speed-related costs such as fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Three components constitute the theory are: (1) the distribution of visit probabilities that describes the likelihood to visit a location among all accessible locations within the prism, (2) the expected speeds while passing these accessible locations and (3) a function that can estimate the costs of these speed-specified motions. To implement this theory, the dissertation first develops methods for calculating or simulating visit probabilities within STPs and NTPs based on fundamental movement theories, including random walks (RWs), Brownian bridges (BBs), and continuous-time semi-Markov process. Building on these methods, this dissertation then develops methods for estimating the expected speed distribution within NTPs for input into the cost functions, in this case a vehicle emission model named MOVESLite. The dissertation also validates these methods using vehicle trajectory data collected by global positioning system (GPS) in New York City, New York, U.S. and Phoenix, Arizona, U.S. The theory, methods and validations in this dissertation contribute to developing cost-benefit measures for prism-based accessibility and using them in sustainable transportation planning practices. They also contribute to further completing the theoretical framework of time geography by characterizing the properties of prisms' interior.",1730396692,,Dissertations & Theses," Song, YingSongYingSong, Ying", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3857703011 , 100028682 , 66569 , 9781339162874 , 3730144 , 3730144", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339162874, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1730396692?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0370 Geographic information science , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0709 Transportation planning"," 0366 Geography , 0370 Geographic information science , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0709 Transportation planning"," 0366 Geography , 0370 Geographic information science , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0709 Transportation planning",," 0366 Geography , 0370 Geographic information science , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0709 Transportation planning"," Geography , Geographic information science , Environmental Studies , Transportation planning"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Earth sciences , Environmental costs , Green accessibility , Space-time prisms , Sustainable transportation planning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Green+Accessibility%3A+Estimating+the+Environmental+Costs+of+Space-time+Prisms+for+Sustainable+Transportation+Planning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Song%2C+Ying&amp;isbn=9781339162874&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rio de Janeiro's Emerging Sporting Mega-Event Geography: Unraveling the Carioca Pattern of Urban Development,"In a span of two years the City of Rio de Janeiro will have hosted two of the biggest sporting events in the world, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. As I argue throughout this dissertation, the potential these sporting mega-events hold for attracting capital investment to the city is immense. And, as such, the City of Rio de Janeiro has unveiled a dizzying array of new urban policy initiatives designed to prepare the city for the mega-event and in the process make the city an attractive space for international investors. The consequences of these policies, I argue, is irrevocably altering the socio-spatial structure of the city creating new landscapes for tourist consumption and zones for real estate speculation. In the process, the City of Rio de Janeiro is permanently reconfiguring its nearly 450-year-old urban settlement pattern characterized by a relatively high-percentage of low-income residents occupying residencies in and near the urban core. This dissertation examines how this process is unfolding across the city. My findings suggest low-income residents are being pushed to the periphery of the city through both ‘hard’ displacement (forced evictions) as well as ‘soft’ forms of displacement, including gentrification. This research specifically focuses on the latter, exploring the various ways in which gentrified landscapes in Rio de Janeiro’s sporting mega-event city have been produced. My research findings suggest a myriad of forces, including ‘exceptional’ urban policies, the commodification of Afro-Brazilian culture, and community ‘pacifying police,’ have been instrumental in producing gentrified landscapes in the city. Yet, by exploring gentrification in a number of spatial contexts over my five years of fieldwork, I suggest these processes unfold in a spatially uneven and place-contingent ways. I thus argue gentrification in Rio de Janeiro is actualized through a series of geographically unique connective processes, rather any one homogenizing force. This dissertation also examines how residents at risk of losing their homes resist gentrification and displacement. Through in-depth interviews with activists and months of participant observation, I point to the importance of place-based social movements asserting their ‘right to stay put’ through vigorous discursive and material defenses of their communities. These activists work to shift the production of locality in their favor so their communities might become viewed as a ‘home’ rather than an exploitable commodity.",1731045257,,Dissertations & Theses," Goode, Ryan JamesGoodeJamesRyanGoode, Ryan James", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858664591 , 95926662 , 66569 , 9781339218137 , 3733519 , 3733519", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339218137, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731045257?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Gentrification , Rio de janeiro , Tourism , Urban morphology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rio+de+Janeiro%27s+Emerging+Sporting+Mega-Event+Geography%3A+Unraveling+the+Carioca+Pattern+of+Urban+Development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goode%2C+Ryan+James&amp;isbn=9781339218137&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reframing Romantic Nature: Towards a Social Ecocriticism,"Reframing Romantic Nature: Towards a Social Ecocriticism is an attempt to offer a new way of thinking about ecological approaches to literature. Rather than separate ecology from the movement of history, or support an anthropocentric historicism, my approach aims to merge the interests of both environmental and historical criticism in order to provide a more interdisciplinary view of conceptions of the natural and the social. The process of history owes much more to the non-human than has been generally allowed, especially in the face of contemporary ecocrisis. In the more than two hundred years since the advent of Romanticism in Britain, figures such as William Wordsworth have become icons, their work celebrated as defining intrinsic elements of cultural identity and history. Yet this same period has seen greater environmental destruction than any other in human existence. The poet who announces the renewal of nature does so at the dawn of the anthropocene, and it is no longer possible to treat these phenomena as entirely distinct. Looking back at the Romantics from our own era of ecocrisis evokes an ambivalence towards Romantic constructions of the natural world. This thesis is an attempt to address this complex ambivalence. The thesis advances these concerns through the reading of texts in various genres by five Romantic authors. The first chapter explores a foundational work of Romanticism, Mary Wollstonecraft’s Letters from Denmark, Norway and Sweden, in terms of how various landscape descriptions are interrupted by both outside forces and internal states, and how these interruptions are emblematic of the irruptive force of capital. This work, though celebrated on its publication for the beauty of its landscape descriptions, is full of a tumultuous and often vexed sense of place. The second chapter addresses the history of deforestation in terms of William Wordsworth’s poem “The Ruined Cottage.” The sense of dearth that poem evokes is, I argue, directly related to the drastic deforestation of England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The next chapter examines the acoustic ecology of John Clare as exemplified in his poem “The Fallen Elm.” How the sounds of the natural world appear as both subjects in his poetry and as influential on the formation of his own patterning of sound is explored, as well as the ideological significance of different types of soundscapes. The focus of the fourth chapter is the urban and suburban landscapes of Thomas De Quincey. Here I examine the appearance of urban sprawl in a variety of works by De Quincey and the way in which the addicted body and the sprawling city become darkly symbolic of each other. The thesis concludes with a reading of Mary Shelley’s The Last Man, a novel about the end of humanity written at the end of the Romantic era. Here I consider how changing thought about the relationship of humanity to deity, along with the panic of 1825, which marked an important recognition of the global reach of capitalism, inform a broader revision of earlier Romantic idealism and anticipate later existential thought.",1734364061,,Dissertations & Theses," Rowney, MatthewRowneyMatthewRowney, Matthew", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3870867781 , 96875812 , 66569 , 9781339147796 , 3729027 , 3729027", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339147796, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734364061?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0329 Ecology , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0329 Ecology , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0329 Ecology , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Ecology , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Biological sciences , British romanticism , Ecology , Economy , Landscape , Material history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reframing+Romantic+Nature%3A+Towards+a+Social+Ecocriticism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rowney%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781339147796&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Epistemology and networked governance: An actor-network approach to network governance,"This dissertation suggests that network governance theory may have reached an impasse, and in order to pursue its advance, new methods need to be used. It tests the viability of actor-network theory on providing new insights on network governance, which could contribute to the strengthening of network governance theory. The author suggests that actor-network theory may offer both an epistemology and ontology that intents to not impose current definitions and divisions of traditional social science. By doing so, actor-network theory focuses on the performance of associations rather than on the traditional categories of structures, institutions, individuals or groups — characteristic of most network governance studies. This study tests the viability of actor-network theory in a complex international environmental policy network in the Andean Amazon. It employs Latour’s three-movement method of deployment of controversies, rendering associations traceable again, and reassembling governance. The methodological strategy provides a clean slate to search for a new perspective of network governance, which is based on participants’ perspectives. It is found that associations are established among programs, projects, public policies, among others; and that this associations seem to remain even if organizations, programs, and projects leave the network. Actor-networks’ roles in network governance appear to be not static, and their degree of affiliation ranges from formal to informal associations. Applying actor-network theory in the study of network governance suggests that action is dislocated, and that groups are in continuous formation. Groups’ boundaries are define and redefine based on participants’ perspectives and associations. Finally, a discussion in regards to the implications of this research for both network governance and actor-network theory is offered.",1747393123,,Dissertations & Theses," O'Brien, Mariana G.O'BrienG.MarianaO'Brien, Mariana G.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3890636871 , 100672832 , 66569 , 9781339170251 , 3730734 , 3730734", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339170251, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1747393123?accountid=14496," 0393 Epistemology , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0393 Epistemology , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0393 Epistemology , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy",," 0393 Epistemology , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," Epistemology , Public administration , Public policy"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Actor-network theory , Epistemology , Network governance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Epistemology+and+networked+governance%3A+An+actor-network+approach+to+network+governance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Brien%2C+Mariana+G.&amp;isbn=9781339170251&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Projecting in Space-time: The Laboratory Method, Modern Architecture and Settlement-Building, 1918-1932","Between 1918 and 1932, a number of European modern architects described their work as ""scientifically managed"" or ""taylorized"", and as ""laboratory work"" or ""practical experiments"", all of which were approaches attributable to the principles of organization used in American industry. Scholars would later dismiss these claims as ""ideological"" or ""propagandistic"", since many of the architectural works of this period were in fact neither fabricated like industrial products nor did they perform as efficiently. However, relying on recent scholarship regarding the history of American industrial organization between 1880 and 1918, this dissertation reassesses the claims of these architects, revealing a more nuanced and thorough comprehension of the principles of American industrial organization, particularly scientific management, than has been previously acknowledged. While many modern architects admired the tools, products and spaces of industry, a select group also showed interest in scientific management's central ontological theory, the ""laboratory method"", which called for the fusion of inquiry and material production within a single space. While the laboratory method is most closely associated with Frederick Taylor, who developed this approach specifically for use in the industrial plant, it was Frank Gilbreth, who, by 1918, had translated this theory for use in a different space of production, the construction site. Frank and his partner, Lillian Gilbreth, developed a ""multi sensory"" approach to projecting processes in ""space-time"", one that combined orthographic projection with data mapping and new media, such as photography and film. Their ""visualization theory"" offered modern architects assistance in an already defined design problem, namely the projection of architectural artifacts at the scale of the pre-modern urban unit, the village or settlement, with the intricacy of a pre-modern manufactured product, such as a door or window, all while considering the perception of a moving subject. Utilizing the principles of modern management, architects sought to rationalize their own ""mental work"", the production of drawing sets, as well as to participate in the bureaucratization or standardization of material parameters and social conventions, occurring at the municipal, national and international scales, during this period. While an interest in scientific management among interwar architects was widespread, this dissertation will show that there were few actual examples of the application of these principles to the process of architectural production; the most notable examples were those conducted by Peter Behrens (1918-1920), Le Corbusier (1923-26), Martin Wagner (1924-1929), Walter Gropius (1926-1929) and Ernst May (1926-1930). In all five cases, the primary goals were the same as they had been for Taylor and Gilbreth, the derivation of novel tentative standard methods, and not solely increase in the efficiency of material production. The application of the laboratory method to settlement-building by these architects was not revolutionary so much as it was evolutionary, with Hermann Muthesius' notion of typological evolution and adaptation, summarized in Kleinhaus und Kleinsiedlung (1920), as well as a set of projection instruments included in Raymond Unwin's design manual, Town Planning in Practice (1909), providing a crucial foundation for the interwar work. This interwar work was further informed by a series of American experiments in industrialized settlement-building, including the Atterbury, Harms and Small, and Unit Systems. The laboratory method and visualization theory of scientific management required a particular balance of control and feedback, which proved difficult to achieve in architectural production, helping to explain the relatively few applications of these principles. Expanding conjecture from the atelier onto the construction site and into use itself, exposed architects to a myriad of problems that they were not entirely equipped to handle. The unique context of Weimar Germany afforded architects like Wagner, Gropius and May a framework that combined the degree of bureaucratization necessary to support experimentation without the ""over-bureaucratization"" that would define the postwar period. A similar framework of control and feedback afforded a team of architects, working within in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, between 1957-1964, an opportunity for applying the laboratory method to architectural production. This work would in turn attract the attention of an international group of artists and theorists, the New Tendencies movement (1961-1973), who saw in it the architectural equivalent of ""programmed art"". As one of the most frequently cited books at these conferences, Norbert Wiener, explained in 1952, ""the notion of programing"" was itself rooted in the ""work of Taylor and the Gilbreths on time study"", before it was ""transferred to the machine"". This research will serve to show that modern architects had translated the principles of industrial organization well before programing became digitized.",1747405303,,Dissertations & Theses," Rupnik, IvanRupnikIvanRupnik, Ivan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3890652701 , 100690792 , 66569 , 9781339295992 , 3739062 , 3739062", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339295992, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1747405303?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning",," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," Architecture , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Design theory , Modern architecture , Scientific management",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Projecting+in+Space-time%3A+The+Laboratory+Method%2C+Modern+Architecture+and+Settlement-Building%2C+1918-1932&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rupnik%2C+Ivan&amp;isbn=9781339295992&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Florentine House of Medici (1389-1743): politics, patronage, and the use of cultural heritage in shaping the Renaissance","A great many individuals and families of historical prominence contributed to the development of the Italian and larger European Renaissance through acts of patronage. Among them was the Florentine House of Medici. The Medici were an Italian noble house that served first as the de facto rulers of Florence, and then as Grand Dukes of Tuscany, from the mid-15th century to the mid-18th century. This thesis evaluates the contributions of eight consequential members of the Florentine Medici family, Cosimo di Giovanni, Lorenzo di Giovanni, Giovanni di Lorenzo, Cosimo I, Cosimo II, Cosimo III, Gian Gastone, and Anna Maria Luisa, and their acts of artistic, literary, scientific, and architectural patronage that contributed to the cultural heritage of Florence, Italy. This thesis also explores relevant social, political, economic, and geopolitical conditions over the course of the Medici dynasty, and incorporates primary research derived from a conversation and an interview with specialists in Florence in order to present a more contextual analysis. Further analysis examines how the Medici successfully used knowledge and beliefs concerning the past, as well as contemporary Florentine culture to advance themselves and cement their legacy. Historical parallels are also explored. Existing literature makes plain that the Medici contributed a great deal to the Renaissance movement through their acts of patronage. This thesis contributes an original perspective to existing literature by concluding that the House of Medici largely shaped, and ultimately epitomizes the Renaissance itself through its contributions to Florentine cultural heritage, and by historic preservation efforts that define how we understand the Renaissance today. Justification for this conclusion is supported by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Advisory Body Evaluation, which cites Medici contributions to the cultural heritage of Florence and the Renaissance in support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designation of the Historic Centre of Florence as a World Heritage Site. The lesson learned is that the cultural heritage of the world is priceless, but it is nothing without measures taken to ensure its protection.",1748999807,,Dissertations & Theses," Cuozzo, Nicholas J.CuozzoJ.NicholasCuozzo, Nicholas J.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3895332841 , 95715702 , 66569 , 9781339226477 , 1603560 , 1603560", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339226477, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1748999807?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Art , Cultural , Culture , Florence , Heritage , Historic , History , Icomos , Italy , Medici , Patronage , Politics , Preservation , Renaissance , Tuscany , Unesco",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Florentine+House+of+Medici+%281389-1743%29%3A+politics%2C+patronage%2C+and+the+use+of+cultural+heritage+in+shaping+the+Renaissance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cuozzo%2C+Nicholas+J.&amp;isbn=9781339226477&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"In transit: Travel and mobility in Latina art and literature,"The myth of American travel and mobility has long shaped ideas of nation and national identity. In postwar cultural production, to move freely is to enact rights governed by U.S. citizenship. Mobility is thus an embodied social, cultural, and political exercise that informs the production of an ideal national subject. Yet, access to and participation in mobile practices is deeply fraught around issues of difference. This project therefore considers Latina engagement with the promise of travel and mobility, drawing attention to the limits of citizenship and complicating the homogenizing tendencies of Latino identity formation. While other scholars primarily focus on Latino mobility through the lens of subjugation and migrant labor, my analysis attends to generational cultural shifts and changing socio-economic conditions. Throughout the study, I focus on the work of Latina artists like Helena Maria Viramontes, Cristina Henríquez, Michele Serros, and Erika Lopez to show how Latinas adopt various modes of travel and mobility that refute fixity in order to forge cross-cultural affiliations on local and global scales. My work sees Latina movement not simply as reenacting U.S. mobility, but also as a complex raced and gendered action anchored in particular political and cultural realities. Reading Latinas’ engagement with postwar mobility-cum-citizenship, In Transit considers how rearticulations of space and time serve to challenge exclusionary practices from within and beyond Latino communities. By considering Latina mobility at various geographic, temporal, and cultural scales, this project complicates Latino literary and cultural theory which tends to separate texts as either resistant or assimilationist. Instead, I see Latinidad as less tied geographically to the U.S. and more about the interplay of gender, class, race, sexuality, space, and time. I provide readings of cultural texts that represent Latinas on “unexpected” paths, thus responding to and reimagining travel down routes heretofore untaken.",1753116928,,Dissertations & Theses," Ruiz, Ariana A.RuizA.ArianaRuiz, Ariana A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3910990241 , 101174972 , 66569 , 9781339326641 , 3740546 , 3740546", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339326641, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1753116928?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0323 American studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," American studies , Womens studies , American literature , Gender studies , Hispanic American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Chicana , Gender , Language , Latina , Literature , Literature and linguistics , Race , Social sciences , Travel , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+transit%3A+Travel+and+mobility+in+Latina+art+and+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ruiz%2C+Ariana+A.&amp;isbn=9781339326641&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The shifting sands of authority in the age of digital convergence,"Authority is a much contested concept often connected to notions of violence and control, and it emanates variably from class, institution, and now—as I argue—from digital convergence, which is the availability and shareability of information across multiple digital platforms at all times. This dissertation considers how digital convergence is responsible for taking what would otherwise be a difference of degree (simply more people sharing more information) and turning it into a difference of kind (people turning information sharing into knowledge making, previously the domain of institutions). Through the tools made available both online and on multiple technological platforms, individual users of the digitally converged network (though primarily users of the Internet) are building their own auctoritas. In the particular case of journalism, this threat primarily stems from individuals and groups of individuals sharing information online that both acts as news and critiques the mainstream media (MSM). Institutions are currently facing such a foundational threat through the platform-wide information availability and shareability of digital convergence and specifically through the topology and design of the network created by it (and which it simultaneously creates). This threat of digital convergence leads to a situation in which individuals and groups of individuals are empowered to create and maintain auctoritas outside the institutional structures that Western culture traditionally leans on for authority and knowledge creation. The individual auctoritas uniquely enabled through digital convergence acts as a valid challenge to the institution’s structure, causing it to respond with proto-authorization and other tactics designed to limit individual auctoritas and maintain institution per se. The Fifth Estate, considered and defined in this dissertation, is a porous border across which the needs of American journalism consumers are met both by journalists and by consumer subjects moving into the journalism role just-in-time. Porousness of the border between production and consumption of cultural knowledge is a threat to an institution whose job traditionally has been considered to be cultural knowledge creation. In many ways, this movement across the porous border between news consumer and producer is neither a new concept nor a new practice. The difference is one of technology and performances. It is through the affordances of a globalized social structure and a global technological connection, as well as ubiquitous access to multiple platforms, that a Fifth Estate can become influential enough to need defining—that is, influential enough to bring American journalism back to its roots in citizen auctoritas. I use three sub-case studies to look at ways the Fifth Estate makes use of tools of digital convergence to cross this porous border and challenge the institutional authority of the Fourth Estate.",1759161416,,Dissertations & Theses," Cassorla, Leah FriedaCassorlaFriedaLeahCassorla, Leah Frieda", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3929625071 , 99535032 , 66569 , 9781339410135 , 10000587 , 10000587", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339410135, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1759161416?accountid=14496," 0489 Information Technology , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0489 Information Technology , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0489 Information Technology , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0489 Information Technology , 0681 Rhetoric"," Information Technology , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Applied sciences , Authority , Digital , Internet , Journalism , Media , Rhetoric",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+shifting+sands+of+authority+in+the+age+of+digital+convergence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cassorla%2C+Leah+Frieda&amp;isbn=9781339410135&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Media narratives on Mapuche hunger strikes in Chile: Constructing ethnic, national and gender identities","The present research focuses on the media narratives covering the Mapuche hunger strikes of 2008 and 2010 in Chile. The objective of the research is to identify and compare the preferred mainstream and ethnic media narratives constructing notions of ethnicity, nationality and gender, as well as, contribute to the current public debate on ethnicity and nationality in Chile. The narratives identified within the mainstream media in 2008 and 2010, pointed to the discursive strategy of the ideological square reinforcing the boundaries between “us” and “them,” as well as, on supposedly Mapuche violence and terrorist actions, and the Mapuche strikers’ alleged disregard for Chilean legislation. By selecting such narratives, the demands and claims of the Mapuche activists were delegitimized and situated outside the borders of the Nation. In terms of gender, the mainstream media illustrated how ethnic and gender boundaries combine to create a unique narrative of exclusion. Female bodies and actions were scrutinized, policed and supervised in relation to a normative standard of femininity; such focus on the gendered body and its transgressions was absent in the case of male strikers. In the case of the ethnic media, the preferred narratives criticized the role of the Chilean State in the repression and criminalization of Mapuche social protest, and the role of the neoliberal expansion in the exploitation and endangering of Mapuche territories and natural resources. The ethnic media also gave preferential attention to the historical context of the conflict, absent in the mainstream media, and the solidarity of the international community with the indigenous movement. The ethnic media narratives can be seen as an example of de-colonial forms of knowledge. In conclusion, the dissertation spells out how media narratives contribute to the construction of notions of ethnicity, nationality and gender. The dissertation highlighted the centrality of the perspectives of coloniality and intersectionality to study how gendered and racialized bodies are subjected to particular narratives of exclusion within mainstream media, and what spaces for alternative narratives are possible.",1766579666,,Dissertations & Theses," Valle, Maria TrinidadValleTrinidadMariaValle, Maria Trinidad", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3957551001 , 102251282 , 66569 , 9781339479477 , 10013399 , 10013399", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339479477, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1766579666?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure , 0733 Gender studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure , 0733 Gender studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure , 0733 Gender studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure , 0733 Gender studies"," Latin American Studies , Political science , Ethnic studies , Social structure , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Ethnicity , Gender , Indigenous movements , Mapuche , Media narratives , Nationality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Media+narratives+on+Mapuche+hunger+strikes+in+Chile%3A+Constructing+ethnic%2C+national+and+gender+identities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Valle%2C+Maria+Trinidad&amp;isbn=9781339479477&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Religion, Iraq's Domestic Political Dynamic and the Islamic State","This thesis examines the government of Iraq and their history that led to the creation of the Islamic State. In addition, it focuses on the ways the Islamic State uses religion to justify their actions while gaining supporters and fighters. In this study, the Islamic State is analysed, predominantly in Iraq, within a historical sense in order to uncover the reasons for their emergence, strength and determination. Within the past thirty years, Iraq has had an incredibly interesting political dynamic. Starting with the Ba'athist party taking control in Iraq in the late 196O's, Iraq began a pro-Sunni regime and decades of Shia oppression. With years of torture and oppression conducted by Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist regime, the United States intervened in 2003, beginning the de-Ba'athification process and government transition. With a new Shia-led government, the tables turned and Sunnis began becoming oppressed, misrepresented and tortured. The Islamic State has shown a great amount of resilience and perseverance throughout their past few years of significance. Before being known as the Islamic State, IS was known as Jamaat al-Tahwid wa-i-Jihad (JTWJ) which was founded in 1999. Once pledging allegiance to Al-Qaeda in 2004, JTWJ adopted their new name, Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). With the change of leadership, the group, once again, adopted a new name, Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), in 2006. However, the Islamic State really gained a name and reputation for themselves once Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took control in 2010 and made the terrorism levels international, as opposed to remaining in the Middle East and North African regions. With the declaration of a caliphate and the use of social media as their source of targeting and recruiting, IS sparked a new fire within the jihadi movement, predominantly targeting the young adult generation. Being a jihadi organisation, the Islamic State identifies themselves with Salafism and Wahhabism. Both Salafism and Wahhabism are branches of Sunni Muslim political ideology that aim to purify the religion. In addition, one can be considered a `true Muslim' only if they follow Salafism and Wahhabism. The jihadi train of thought sees no issue in killing those who they consider to be nonbelievers or non-supporters of their ideology. Since the scholars of Wahhabism, such as Ibn Taymiyya, encouraged for such actions, the Islamic State has gone ahead and taken action, while justifying their actions on a jihadi train on throught. Therefore, this study examines the background and historical context of Iraq and the Islamic State, as it is essential in understanding the reason for their uprising. In addition, this study focuses on the religious implications that the Islamic State has used and continues to use in order to justify their acts of terrorism.

It analyses the manifestation of Islamic reformism in the city’s urban periphery where social organisation has historically been structured by principles of Makhuwa kinship and post-socialist citizenship, while religious life is dominated by Makhuwa ritual specialists, the Catholic Church and Sufi orders. Recently, however, the ranks of Sufi orders have been dwindling. The decline has been matched by a sharp increase in the number and influence of reformist mosques. With financial support from international Islamic donors, reformist mosques seek to bring local understandings of Islam in line with globally-oriented Salafi-inspired interpretations. The thesis describes the appropriation, contestation and impact of these interpretations. There are three main findings. First, I found that Islamic reformism unsettles existing conceptions of personhood. The majority of city dwellers combine their religious and national sense of belonging with Makhuwa notions of relatedness and conceptualise the self as interdependent. In contrast, reformists define themselves in relation to the divine, and objectify the self as they seek to make it available for self-fashioning. Second, the significance of this reorientation lies in its epistemological ramifications. A variety of social forms in northern Mozambique, including neighbourly assistance, the administration of justice and political relations, are premised on the understanding that events in this world are structured by invisible forces. Attempts of Islamic reformists to orient themselves towards God lead them to perceive reality in more objective terms, and consequently, their participation in neighbourhood sociality changes. Thirdly, this reorientation is tentative. In a setting where many do not share the outlook of reformism, it produces dilemmas and uncertainties. People cope with these uncertainties using strategies of confrontation, negotiation and compromise. Islamic reformism and other dimensions of social life become, as a result, mutually constitutive. These findings have several theoretical implications. The recent trend in anthropology has been to study Islamic reform movements through the lens of practices of ethical self-fashioning. This thesis argues that this focus is too narrow. My data shows that the multiplicity and complexity of the life worlds of Muslims need to be considered, and that attention should be paid to questions of how Islamic reformism shapes social practice as a system of knowledge.",1779253556,,Dissertations & Theses," Laheij, ChristianLaheijChristianLaheij, Christian", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013252231 , 103451732 , 101309 , 10088861 , 10088861 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3128/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779253556?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3128/ , (UMI)AAI10088861 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+country+of+trial%3A+islamic+reformism%2C+pluralism+and+dispute+management+in+peri-urban+northern+mozambique&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Laheij%2C+Christian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Digital technologies, social media and emerging, alternative documentary production methodologies","My research is a practice-based project involving documentary production and theoretical analysis of emerging forms of documentary and online co-collaboration, exploring paradigm shifts in digital technology particularly in the web-based feminist activism and feminist social praxis. The practice-led research explores new forms of production practices outside traditional methodologies and dissemination. Specifically, by utilizing cheap digital technology tools and working within online social networking platforms the research theoretically analyses what means were available towards online participatory media practices to create new documentary forms. My research aims are therefore to investigate how the new paradigm shifts in digital technology and the democratization of the filmmaking process, through online, collaborative practice, can allow women documentary filmmakers to connect to a global marketplace outside the traditional filmmaking channels. Further, looking at the history of the documentary form, as well as the feminist movement, I am interested in which of the key themes and debates that have characterized their intersection are still important at this moment of changing and emerging technologies. Can new technologies, access to cheap digital tools and collaborative modes of practice help or hinder the creative process of making a digital documentary? In examining the history of feminist filmmaking and the emerging documentary shifts in production offered the opportunity to position my own practice within these traditions and experiment further with online forms of modality. This experiment allowed me to gather empirical data using new media practices (i.e. creation and curation of online and repurposed content, use of new production tools within online spaces) to create a first person, auto-ethnographic narrative on the subject of feminism and online activism. Additionally, my research looks at the theoretical and historical underpinnings surrounding feminist filmmaking, new documentary practices and its implications within new technologies, and the emerging forms of collaborative online modes of practice. Each of these areas will intersect within the three key areas of debate surrounding documentary filmmaking; those of 1) narrativity, 2) witness and 3) ethics. My practice investigates these interactive, participatory modes created with emerging technologies and online audiences and how this is shifting narratives, audience reception and producing new ethical debates around ‘truth' and ‘authenticity' as these lines are continually blurred. Rethinking documentary in the virtual space brings about new challenges to the old debates around evidence, witness and ethics, as it is the product of a more democratic attitude towards practice, distribution and dissemination of its stories. New participatory audiences are now also helping to create the very product they are witnessing. Therefore, creating media within the public sphere can bring about a wealth of new tools, wider contributions to media making and a more global awareness of its dissemination. But it is not without its controversy and challenges. Further, my research looks at how working within this co-collaborative mode, the position of filmmaker as the ‘sole' creator or ‘auteur' comes into question. It discuses the advantages and/or the disadvantages to this approach and in doing so looks at what contributions and challenges an online audience can provide to support the filmmaker that cannot be gained through historical and traditional production and exhibition forms. What once was a higher barrier to entry into the film business is now a more open and online accessibility where anyone can wield a cheap camera or mobile phone device, make a movie and share it on the internet. These newfound democratic practices could potentially disrupt an already complex system of communication practices. However, it could also supply it with a much-needed collective idea bank for tackling global issues and finding sustainable solutions. Within the scope of participatory practices, a first person filmmaker can experience the greatest of democratic freedom within the confines of this process and delivery. The research is supported and conducted through a practice-led film project, web support platform (including blog and social media sites) and published case study. The final output film project around which these questions are posed is entitled: “Single Girl in a Virtual World: What does a 21st Century Feminist Look Like?”. The film's purpose is therefore to engage an online global audience of participants and contributors to the film's narrative thread by asking for contributions within the production, creation and financing of the documentary film. The practice utilizes social networks, crowd funding initiatives, web blogs, viral video, virtual chat interaction and traditional modes of documentary practice in its methodology in an effort to collect data surrounding activity and attempt to answer my research questions at large. The overall objective is to create an online documentary film that exemplifies feminist activism in a new frame through application of documentary modes and new emerging digital media practices.",1779253799,,Dissertations & Theses," Nelson, JodiNelsonJodiNelson, Jodi", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013250841 , 103716172 , 101309 , 10086269 , 10086269 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/54595/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779253799?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/54595/ , (UMI)AAI10086269 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Digital+technologies%2C+social+media+and+emerging%2C+alternative+documentary+production+methodologies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nelson%2C+Jodi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"(in) formality in e-waste movement &amp;amp; management in the global economy,"This thesis unpacks the dynamic nature and architecture of the global e-waste (electronic and electrical waste) recycling network. It analyses the functions of formal (guided by regulatory apparatus) and informal sectors (usually outside the regulatory orbit) involved in waste production and processing and their structural inter-linkages to situate the process and practise of informality in e-waste in the realm of formal capitalist economy. Additionally, it investigates the impact of regulatory interventions on the waste network and the actors therein. It focuses on the spatiality of waste treatment where the narrative of the physical material starts in the formal sector of electronics manufacturing and consumption and travels along quasi-legal channels of e-scrap trade and traffic to reach the informal sector (often in developing countries) for its end-of-life management. Till date, the systemic interconnections between formality and informality in waste processing operations have not been analysed in the waste scholarship. Despite critically reviewing the widespread presence and preponderance of informality with its definite characteristics, the literature has largely disregarded its relationship with formality and the broader lexicon of production and exchange. This research addresses this important omission in the literature and examines the drivers of informality and myriad formal-informal associations in e-waste transfer and treatment in the changing contours of the global economy. The following research question guides the structure and argument of this thesis. Main Research Question: What drives informality in e-waste movement and management?The research follows the trajectory of the international waste stream and examines how these path(way)s are embedded in the socio-economic processes of formality and informality. It uses the qualitative field work conducted in Netherlands, Belgium and India (Delhi) in 2011 and 2012. The fieldwork covers all the stakeholders engaged directly or indirectly in the e-waste network starting with the manufacturers, consumers to the traders, collectors, dismantlers, recyclers and second-hand sellers in both formal and informal sectors as well as the state and NGOs. The production, distribution and consumption of electronics, its waste and the recovered elements are not disjoint despite their apparent dispersion across geographical and political borders. Rather it is a functionally and organizationally inter-connected network characterised by a continuum of formal-informal material transfer, socio-economic transactions and financial arrangements between different players performing diverse functions. The analytical foundation of this study is laid by the Global Production Network (GPN) approach which follows the spatial e-waste flow in the post-consumption stage and locates the role and position of the various actors engaged in the process. It deconstructs the inter-connections between the formal and the informal actors by drawing on the rich formality-informality discourse. It uses the Global Value Chain (GVC) framework to specifically interrogate the vertical and horizontal governance patterns and power imbalances between the different players and additionally employs the idea of informal social networks from the industrial clusters literature to understand the ties of family, kinship and community between them. The study also engages with the diverse (re)valuations of e-waste and the (re)creation of secondary products that are used for further consumption and production. The value generated, circulated and captured in the waste recycling stream by the participating actors is understood using the Marxian exposition of circuits of capital. The e-waste network is institutionally embedded in particular geographical settings, socio-cultural milieus and regulatory framework leading to spatially differential comprehensions and treatment of e-waste. The roles of the regulatory and civic initiatives in conditioning and configuring this network are scrutinised to deliberate on the different paradigms of its management. The research illustrates that the fluidity between formality and informality in waste processing is crucial in (re)fashioning and (re)constructing waste for further use. It suggests that commodity production, consumption, waste generation and treatment are conjoined internationally in which value is created and circulated across sectoral and geographical boundaries. In effect, it reflects on the politics and practices of waste production and management and questions the design and enforcement of state policies towards eco-friendly processing of e-waste.",1779362243,,Dissertations & Theses," Laha, SomjitaLahaSomjitaLaha, Somjita", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013254321 , 102699132 , 101309 , 10078495 , 10078495 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:263090", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779362243?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:263090 , (UMI)AAI10078495 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%28in%29+formality+in+e-waste+movement+%26amp%3B+management+in+the+global+economy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Laha%2C+Somjita&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cross-border higher education and quality management,"Several dynamics have contributed to the increasing conception of higher education as a service, universities as service providers, students as customers and quality as value for money. Quality management has been pursued as a means to promote accountability and is primarily driven by student satisfaction surveys. This has resulted in the dominance of the retrospective customer model for the management of quality in higher education (Biggs, 2001) with emphasis on accountability and ‘value for money’ for the student customer. At the same time, decreasing public funding and a growing student demand for higher education programmes has increased the provision of programmes across borders. This has increased cross-border education activities, which involve the movement of people, institutions and programmes across borders. The latter, termed transnational education, happens when higher education institutions collaborate with institutions in other countries to offer their programmes offshore by forming transnational education partnerships. The current quality management model in transnational education partnerships is dominated by concentration on ‘risk mitigation’ for exporting countries and ‘sameness’ of quality standards between ‘home’ and ‘offshore’ provisions. This is pursued by the exporting country’s retrospective customer model, which takes no consideration of the difference of student expectations and perceptions in different locations of programme delivery. Thus, the applicability of the retrospective customer model in TNHE can be problematic, owing to the fact that students who study in different parts of the world on the same programme are very likely to have different expectations and perceptions of quality in higher education. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the applicability of the retrospective customer model and to propose a prospective model for the management of quality in TNHE partnerships. The research is pursued within a Critical Realist theoretical paradigm, considering that students, irrespective of their location, will form common expectations and perceptions independently of their own interpretations, but at the same time will be impacted, to a significant extent, by the deeper social and cultural dynamics of a particular time and space. The research strategy deployed in this thesis is a case study, using a mixed methods sequential design including a questionnaire survey followed by individual semi-structured interviews as the data collection methods. The analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data showed that students appear to share a common ‘customer’ identity which is shaped by the prevailing quality discourse 2 in higher education. However, students appear to be immature as customers, contrary to the assumption made within the current quality discourse about students being rational decision agents. Students, irrespective of their location, seem to be less aware of the transformative role of higher education and appear to develop an instrumental approach in regard to their expectations and perceptions of quality in higher education. The analysis of the data also showed that the expectations and perceptions of students who are studying on the same programme but at different geographical locations vary. Specifically, it was found that student expectations and perceptions are shaped by a range of contextual dynamics. A conceptual framework has emerged from the findings of the research which can be used as a framework for the analysis, discussion and evaluation of student expectations and perceptions in a TNHE context. The findings of the research have significant ramifications for the applicability of the retrospective customer model in TNHE relating to both service quality (student satisfaction) and educational quality. Specifically, the findings of this thesis suggest that a retrospective customer model which has been designed in one country using the local contextual dynamics would not be applicable in another country without modifications and adjustments. Instead, the research justifies and proposes the adoption of a prospective model for the management of quality in TNHE which enables the acknowledgement and management of student expectations and perceptions prior to academic delivery",1779544788,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsiligiris, VangelisTsiligirisVangelisTsiligiris, Vangelis", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015225971 , 103733452 , 101309 , 10076657 , 10076657", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779544788?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10076657 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cross-border+higher+education+and+quality+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsiligiris%2C+Vangelis&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Risen from chaos: the development of modern education in china, 1905-1948","My PhD thesis studies the rise of modern education in China and its underlying driving forces from the turn of the 20th century. It is motivated by one sweeping educational movement in Chinese history: the traditional Confucius teaching came to an abrupt end, and was replaced by a modern and national education model at the turn of the 20th century. This thesis provides the first systematic quantitative studies that examine the rise of education through the initial stage of its development. It mainly contains three analytical parts. The first one sets out the jourey toward the birth of the first modern education system, and generalized the main virtues and progresses it brought to China. The second section provides long-term estimates on how much education progressed through 20th century based on a rich variety of indicators: literacy rate, enrolment ratio, and more importantly -- human capital stock (average years of schooling). This exercise allows putting Chinese accomplishments in education into international perspective. The last Chapter of this thesis tackles one hotly debated question that ‘what factors drove the rise of mass schooling (primary education)?’ Given its political turmoil and economic backwardness, the expansion of modern primary schooling that was mainly driven by increasing public efforts seems puzzling. What contributed to mass education’s noteworthy diffusion in China? Based on a dataset that covers more than one thousand counties, we find that economic factors have little power in explaining the variations in educational outcomes. In contrast, both informal practice of governance imposed by gentry (one important social group in Chinese history) and regional political stability presented their critical importance. The findings of this section not only contribute to pin down determinants of education expansion, but also shed lights on a growing literature stressing the importance of informal institution in providing public goods in non-democratic societies.",1780274873,,Dissertations & Theses," Gao, PeiGaoPeiGao, Pei", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018938771 , 103451732 , 101309 , 10091735 , 10091735 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3169/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780274873?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3169/ , (UMI)AAI10091735 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Risen+from+chaos%3A+the+development+of+modern+education+in+china%2C+1905-1948&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gao%2C+Pei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Understanding chinese nationalism through chinese politics: competing claims and state-society dynamics,"This thesis explores how different understandings, interpretations, and claims of diverse social actors from a growingly liberalizing society interact with China’s authoritarian state and various agents in the market in shaping contemporary Chinese nationalism. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that sees the force and impact of nationalism primarily through its homogenizing effect on the people, this thesis argues instead that the success of nationalism, as a mobilizing force, depends on the existence of differences that various social actors inject into the discourse of state nationalism. Therefore, the key to understanding contemporary Chinese nationalism is to study the meanings and causes of such differences, which are wrapped up in the discourse of nationalism and reflect new dynamics of Chinese politics. This phenomenon, as observed in China, represents a typical case in societies where the willingness and capabilities of people have increased in lodging nationalist claims towards other peoples. By explaining how and why nationalism has become a useful mobilizing force in China, where people do not take for granted what is propagandized by the government, this thesis also tries to make a theoretical push in the literature of nations and nationalism. It investigates the dialectical relations between tensions and disparities embedded in nationalism, on the one hand, and the homogenizing effect of nationalism at the national and symbolic levels, on the other hand. In so doing, it sheds new light on one of the most inviting puzzles in the field of nations and nationalism – why nationalism (like all ideologies) can incite widespread passion and appeal on the ground. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 examine the phenomenon of contemporary Chinese nationalism, the conventional wisdom under which it has been studied, theoretical assumptions and their major critiques, and the theoretical propositions to be advanced in this thesis. Chapter 1 explores the puzzle of why nationalism can incite popular passion and appeal in the general field of nations and nationalism. In particular, it asks where the mobilizing power of nationalism comes from - whether it lies in the capacity to regularize diversity and construct homogeneity among the population, or it is in the other way around. Thus this chapter demonstrates what the study of contemporary Chinese nationalism can borrow from and lend to the field. Chapter 1 lays out major propositions of the thesis, introduces the research methods employed, and offers an overview of the rest chapters. Chapter 2 has two parts. The first part reviews and challenges three basic assumptions in the study of contemporary Chinese nationalism, which have to be reconsidered for the field to advance. The first assumption sees the rise of Chinese nationalism as a post- 1989 phenomenon. The second assumes state-centrism, lacking systematic investigation of the dynamics between state and society in reproducing nationalism. The third takes it for granted that Chinese nationalism must be a subversive force for international security, either because it is manipulated by the Chinese government or because it is incited by populists from below. The second part offers an introduction to the changing relationship between state and society in contemporary China, deciphering the sociopolitical context in which the following empirical chapters are developed. For the purpose of understanding the rise of diverse social actors, and their understandings, interpretations and claims of Chinese nationalism, this part disaggregates Chinese society so that relevant processes of social differentiation and contention during the reform period can be analytically presented. For the purpose of understanding the mechanisms through which these social actors are able to make their nationalist claims under the banner of Chinese nationalism sponsored by the state, it also disaggregates the (party-) state so that the relationships between its component parts and with society, and the relations between the central and local authorities in contemporary China are clarified. Except for the introductory and conclusion chapters, this thesis is composed of four empirical chapters. Chapter 3 deals with different understandings, interpretations, and claims of Chinese nationalism through the problem of victimhood in Sino-Japanese relations. It shows how competing claims for suffering in the 2nd Sino-Japanese War have been expressed, transformed and nationalized, which grows from the bottom of society and incites anti-Japanese nationalism at the national level. Chapter 4 studies visual representation of disparities and tensions between subpopulations and the party-state in making claims and interpretations of Chinese nationalism, through the changing images of anti-Japanese resistance in films, television series and Internet programs. It finds that joint endeavors and differing motivations of local governments, profit-seeking producers, artists and intellectuals, and minority groups have transformed popular images of anti-Japanese resistance in the Maoist years to new stylized images in the time of mass entertainment. Chapter 5 looks at the Baodiao (Protecting the Diaoyu Islands) Movement and its evolution in three political contexts (Taiwan, Hong Kong and China). It shows that, in all of the three contexts, Baodiao is a spontaneous social movement unfolding in the contestation between the regime and competing claimants for nationalism. Yet it is under the most authoritarian and unstable regime that civilian contestation embedded in Baodiao, as advocated by the middle class and professionals, has been stifled, and the movement has fallen prey of street violence. Chapter 6 focuses on one special group of the Chinese elites – the outspoken military officers of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). It shows how their views in the mass media, which encourage anti-American nationalism, reflect more of their own personal viewpoints and sectoral interests than the Party’s line. Taken together, Chapters 3, 5 and 6 shed light on the general argument of the thesis by providing case studies of different social strata in contemporary China. Chapter 7 is the conclusion chapter. This chapter offers a summary and five policy caveats for international security and diplomacy, which are derived from the study of this thesis. It suggests that the evolution of socio-political conditions and state-society dynamics, rather than the substances and contents of state nationalism or popular nationalism, that will determine what kind of impact nationalism is likely to have on China’s domestic politics and international behavior. Therefore we should be careful not to draw too much, either pessimistically or optimistically, from the rise of contemporary Chinese nationalism.",1780275350,,Dissertations & Theses," Ren, Justine ZhengRenZhengJustineRen, Justine Zheng", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018938651 , 103451732 , 101309 , 10095316 , 10095316 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3221/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780275350?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3221/ , (UMI)AAI10095316 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+chinese+nationalism+through+chinese+politics%3A+competing+claims+and+state-society+dynamics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ren%2C+Justine+Zheng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Chai for change?: stories of adivasi indigeneities, self-reliance, and activism","""Chai for change?"" is a story about stories. More precisely, stories of Adivasi self-reliance, Adivasi indigeneities, and Adivasi activism. At the outset of this study of narratives of Adivasi indigeneity, I posit that the indigenisation of Adivasis fulfils different objectives in the field of Development practice and international “aid” processes. I argue that the Development activists I follow in this story achieve, or attempt to achieve, these objectives through the narrativisation of Adivasi indigeneity. I analyse how a particular group of Adivasi communities try to consolidate the sustainability and permanence of their, and other disadvantaged communities’, economic self- reliance. I also show how the Development activists engaged with these Adivasi communities connect the different actors involved in these self-reliance efforts via narratives of Adivasi indigeneity. I then argue that the activists manage to enlist the large group of different Development actors – and their financial support – necessary for a shift in economic relations, through the harnessing of a particular brand of Adivasi indigeneity in their stories. This conceptualisation of indigeneity corresponds largely with essentialised eco-romanticist imaginaries of “the indigenous”, and therefore “the Adivasi”, based on internationally current, reified notions of indigeneity. Through first identifying the dominant elements of these Adivasi indigeneity narratives, and then analysing the pitfalls inherent in them, I bring to light the inconsistencies between activist-imagined Adivasi indigeneity narratives, and the multiplicity of conflicting identities of Adivasi peoples in India today. ""Chai for change?"" concludes by investigating, on the one hand, whether the efforts of the Adivasi activists to create a more sustainable economic system, informed by Adivasi values, help sustain a progressive and self-reliant Adivasi movement. On the other hand, I explore whether the activists’ jumping on the indigenist rhetoric bandwagon, is in fact a useful strategy for Adivasis to overcome economic inequalities, (re)enforced and (re)produced by the complex intermeshing of ethnicity and caste in India. Specifically, I examine whether narrative-intensive indigenism is a useful strategy for dealing with Adivasi intersectionality – understood as the intersection of the multiple forms of discrimination Adivasis face. Or, whether indigenism’s anachronistic elements – in particular the activists’ adherence to an ecologically romantic conceptualisation of Adivasi values – possibly render the activists’ rhetorical strategies counterproductive, and thereby create obstacles to sustaining the momentum of their movement. ""Chai for change?"" is thus a narrative-focussed study of how conflictual notions of Adivasi indigeneity, harnessed for “development” ends by development activists, often become unravelled and entangled in tensions and contradictions, like a snarled-up ball of narrative yarn. I argue that the social activists try to offset this tendency by continually adapting the narrative of their stories, in an attempt to attract ever new and different audiences for their Adivasi economic revolution story.",1783894969,,Dissertations & Theses," Aufschnaiter, Claudia CaterinaAufschnaiterCaterinaClaudiaAufschnaiter, Claudia Caterina", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4012970751 , 103112882 , 101309 , 10069061 , 10069061 , http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/10935/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1783894969?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/10935/ , (UMI)AAI10069061 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Chai+for+change%3F%3A+stories+of+adivasi+indigeneities%2C+self-reliance%2C+and+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aufschnaiter%2C+Claudia+Caterina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Women in contemporary palestinian cinema,"This thesis seeks to increase recognition of contemporary Palestinian women’s cinema and locates it firmly within the Palestinian film industry. I argue that Palestinian women’s cinema has created and developed a nuanced cinema whilst sustaining and enhancing the Palestinian film industry. The twenty-first century has undeniably witnessed the vigorous development of a Palestinian women’s cinema and the number of Palestinian women filmmakers and films is still on the rise. Scholars have often focused on increasing worldwide recognition of mainstream Palestinian films directed and produced by well-known Palestinian filmmakers. This has resulted in the marginalisation of Palestinian women’s cinema within an already marginalised Palestinian film industry. I locate Palestinian cinema, in the introduction, as a transnational cinema and I also explain my rationale for placing women’s film under the category of “women’s cinema”. In order to offer a comprehensive analysis and to understand and examine the corpus of films in this thesis, I firstly provide an overview of the historical and contemporary background of Palestinian popular arts and cinema, highlighting Palestinian women’s participation. In chapter 2, I discuss women’s roles in Palestinian politics in order to trace women’s positions and roles in political public life because it is difficult to separate activism from social life and thus from cinema, as these three intersect and mutually influence one another. In chapter 3, 4 and 5 I argue, through detailed discussion and analysis of this body of work that, unlike Palestinian cinema at large, Palestinian women filmmakers embody, interweave and reflect on the complex and often contradictory contemporary and historical issues taking into account ideologies and socio-cultural differences in a complex geopolitical space (e.g. sexual restrictions, power and authority, femininity and masculinity, restriction on movement and hyphenated identities). I also argue that these women filmmakers are interested in developing responses to what they see as heterogeneous and hyphenated Palestinian identities while adapting traditional and modern filmic styles. Here I have studied their works thematically as this provided greater insight into the social and historical contexts of contemporary Palestinian lives. I argue that films by Palestinian filmmakers living inside Palestine focus and revolve around socio-culturally sensitive and underrepresented issues of love and sexuality (chapter 3), violence and power (chapter 4). I also argue that hyphenated Palestinian filmmakers, in this case, Palestinian American filmmakers, explore through their work themes of displacement and the imagined homeland by reflecting on historical events and also through examining the different ‘journeys’ of their hyphenated characters, both internal and geographical. I study the films in this thesis within contemporary discourses on culture, cultural capital, discourses of power, identity, migration and diaspora, exile, feminist debates, gender politics, postcoloniality and borderlands.",1784057097,,Dissertations & Theses," Salem, Lema MalekSalemMalekLemaSalem, Lema Malek", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017579391 , 102699132 , 101309 , 10082877 , 10082877", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784057097?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10082877 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Women+in+contemporary+palestinian+cinema&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Salem%2C+Lema+Malek&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Awkward geographies?: an historical and cultural geography of the journal contemporary issues in geography and education (cige) (1983-1991),"This thesis concerns itself with the excavation of the historical and cultural geographies of the production, circulation, and reception of a grassroots-initiated geography education journal, and of the lives of the people and movement that contributed to its existence. Contemporary Issues in Geography and Education (CIGE) was the journal of the Association of Curriculum Development in Geography (ACDG): a pan-institutional collective of school geography teachers, authors, artists, activists and academics who desired a vision of school geography informed from the political Left, to enable the voices of those excluded from power to be explored and heard, and to offer up an alternative version of disciplinary geographical knowledge-making. Between the publication of its launch issue in 1983 and 1991 when it ceased publishing CIGE produced eight theme issues covering universally significant and highly contentious themes (racism, multinational trade, apartheid capitalism, war and peace, gender, ecological crisis and anarchism) from a humanist and critical perspective, offering critical analyses of the geographies therein and educational resources to utilise in educational training across schools, universities and staff education resource centres. CIGE questioned the spaces though which geographical education perpetuating social inequalities might be encountered (children’s TV through to national press criticism, publishers, subject associations, examination boards and academia). Well enough known during its publishing life and subscribed to nationally and internationally across a range of organisations, many of its contributors subsequently forged significant careers as human geographers within the Anglo-American academy, yet limited reference has been made to the journal post-1991. Recovering the stories of the journal and the people whose lives made the series, brings forth controversies and in turn awkward geographies in recovering how and why the journal series ceased publishing and why there appears to be such omission in historiographic accounts. Employing conceptual ideas pertaining to themes of archival activism, activist archives, navigating the recent past, disciplinary identity-making and geobiography, the thesis illustrates the strengths of ‘slow methodologies’ and the adoption of longitudinal research methods to enable the recovery and corroboration of primary sources, while signposting how mechanisms of contemporary academia (giving seminar workshop and conference papers on national and international scales, writing papers and co-authoring book chapters) through can reactivate engagement with the recovered archives and agitate for further materials to be revealed.",1784057131,,Dissertations & Theses," Norcup, JoanneNorcupJoanneNorcup, Joanne", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017568741 , 102699102 , 101309 , 10091568 , 10091568 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/6849/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784057131?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/6849/ , (UMI)AAI10091568 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Awkward+geographies%3F%3A+an+historical+and+cultural+geography+of+the+journal+contemporary+issues+in+geography+and+education+%28cige%29+%281983-1991%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Norcup%2C+Joanne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Elucidating the drivers, contextual sensitivity and resilience of urban ecological systems","As the global population urbanises, the benefits derived from contact with nature increasingly depend upon the presence of diverse urban ecological communities. These may be threatened by changes in land-cover and the intensification of land-use. A key question is how to design and manage cities to retain desirable species, habitats and processes. Addressing this question is challenging, due to the dominant role of humans in shaping spatially and temporally complex urban landscapes. Earlier research identified ecological patterns along urban–rural gradients, often using simplified measures of built form and disturbance. The central theme within this thesis is that we require a more mechanistic understanding of the processes that created today‘s ecological patterns, which recognises the interactions between social and ecological sub-systems. Using bats (Chiroptera) as a case study group, I identified a broadly negative association between bat activity and built density. Urban tree networks appeared beneficial for one species, and further work revealed that their role in facilitating movement depended upon the size of gaps in tree lines and their illumination level. Resilience analyses were used to map diverse dependencies between the functioning of urban bat habitats and human social factors; illustrating the value of a more mechanistic systems-based approach.",1784057540,,Dissertations & Theses," Hale, James DavidHaleDavidJamesHale, James David", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017586471 , 103451742 , 101309 , 10093302 , 10093302 , http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/6238/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784057540?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/6238/ , (UMI)AAI10093302 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Elucidating+the+drivers%2C+contextual+sensitivity+and+resilience+of+urban+ecological+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hale%2C+James+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Defensible space as a mobile concept: the role of transfer mechanisms and evidence in housing research, policy and practice","Defensible space is a contested yet influential approach to designing-out-crime on social housing estates. This thesis uses defensible space as the vehicle to explore how movement changes concepts; to extend the learning on policy mobility mechanisms; to investigate the varied cross-disciplinary nature of evidence use; and to explore the interaction of policy, the housing sector and the state. Deepening the international policy mobilities narrative, the study traces the dispersal/embedding of the concept in Britain since the 1980s by revisiting the operational and theoretical account of defensible space proposed by Alice Coleman in the Design Improvement Controlled Experiment (DICE). Drawing on interviews with planning and architecture practitioners, housing managers and elite policymakers, the thesis explores the multiple ways the concept was interpreted and implemented as it circulated from national to local level and within three London housing estates, illustrating how the transfer mechanisms worked at both a policy and practical level. Despite being a concept whose principles continue to underpin design guidance (such as Secured by Design), defensible space failed to coalesce into a single formal policy, remaining a cluster of associated disputed elements. How these conceptual elements aided or hindered transfer and take up is noted by tracking routes to acceptance, the roles of formal transfer mechanisms, informal information sharing by transfer agents traversing networks, or practitionersʼ local contextualization of generic guidance. The research demonstrates the ongoing resilience and acceptance of defensible space, despite biased evaluation, the mismatch of DICE to the politics of the time and the uncertain nature of the concept. By questioning whether positivist scientific theoretical unity is achievable in practice, it argues for greater trust in practitioner experience, and proposes a looser middle-range approach to theory building for ambiguous concepts such as defensible space.",1784057815,,Dissertations & Theses," Warwick, Elanor Joan PetraWarwickJoan PetraElanorWarwick, Elanor Joan Petra", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017578911 , 103112892 , 101309 , 10092560 , 10092560 , http://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/defensible-space-as-a-mobile-concept(78c8a507-a372-4ad0-8450-7aef9c47ba7a).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784057815?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/defensible-space-as-a-mobile-concept(78c8a507-a372-4ad0-8450-7aef9c47ba7a).html , (UMI)AAI10092560 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defensible+space+as+a+mobile+concept%3A+the+role+of+transfer+mechanisms+and+evidence+in+housing+research%2C+policy+and+practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Warwick%2C+Elanor+Joan+Petra&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Utopias, magic realism and rebellious spirits: films of christine parker 1990 to 2000","“The More You Look, the more THERE IS to see…” From Hinekaro Goes on a Picnic and Blows up Another Obelisk (Christine Parker, Oceania Parker, 1995) In the 1990s New Zealand was in the grip of free market fundamentalism, neo-liberal deregulation of the economy having begun in the mid-eighties. The Maori protest movement was a major source of societal conflict and feminism had become the ‘F’ word. This study examines my writing and directing during the 1990s in New Zealand. It is proposed that the films contributed to national and international conversations around feminism, colonial struggles, spirituality and the supernatural. It is argued that these works offer a social critique of neoliberalism and the divisive effects of it, on women in particular. In the context of this appraisal neoliberalism is understood to be a set of beliefs that support the functioning of the global free market, with minimal government regulation, except to protect the functioning of private enterprise and the ownership of private property. The short films One Man’s Meat (1991), Peach (1993), and Hinekaro Goes on a Picnic and Blows up Another Obelisk (1995) and the feature film Channelling Baby (1999) are located in an oeuvre of female, Gay, and Maori film makers and artists responding to this environment. The recurrence of alternative utopias, the use of magic realism and the representation of the spiritual and supernatural in my work are also considered in relation to other films made in the period. A case is made that the films were part of a small vanguard of films responding to the 1990s status quo by offering alternative modes of discourse to the dominant economic rationalism. Rich in visual intensity and heightened narrative tropes, such as irony and fragmented narratives, my aesthetic choices, together with recurring themes of chance and fate, agency and identity, are considered to link the films together as a coherent study. While the works are located in an evolving feminist tradition in the 1990s, their continued relevance today, particularly in relation to foregrounding marginal voices and the disruption of dominant paradigms and expectations of female behaviour and identity, underpin the claim for originality.",1784058082,,Dissertations & Theses," Templeton-Parker, ChristineTempleton-ParkerChristineTempleton-Parker, Christine", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017587411 , 103787562 , 101309 , 10093723 , 10093723 , http://hdl.handle.net/10545/582854", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784058082?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10545/582854 , (UMI)AAI10093723 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Utopias%2C+magic+realism+and+rebellious+spirits%3A+films+of+christine+parker+1990+to+2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Templeton-Parker%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Across the iron curtain: european socialism between world war and cold war, 1943-1948","This thesis is a comparative history of the post-war European socialist parties, 1943-1948 – with a focus on the Czechoslovakian Social Democratic Party and the Polish Socialist Party in Eastern Europe as well as the French Socialist Party and the Italian Socialist Party in Western Europe. Its foremost aim is to demonstrate that the countries of East and West, far from already being divided by an Iron Curtain, faced much the same challenges during these first post-war years. Contrary to the conventional historiographical picture of an international socialist movement split along Cold War lines, therefore, it draws attention to the divergences within and parallels across the two putative ‘blocs’. To do so, the thesis moves the spotlight away from geo-politics and focuses upon that set of problems that really dominated the agendas of the post-war European socialist parties – the problems of post-war reconstruction. The thesis addresses socialist attitudes towards two of the key dimensions of post-war reconstruction. Its first part deals with socio-economic reconstruction. This part demonstrates that there was often a profound disconnect between socialist leaders in national government and the workers at their grassroots. Whereas rank-and-file (socialist) workers berated their leaders for their failure to improve the material situation, for their inability to clamp down upon the black market, and for the remaining inequalities of post-war life, national party leaders scolded workers for their unruliness and for their unwillingness to make sacrifices towards the greater political good. Its second part deals with political reconstruction – more specifically with the question of rebuilding democracy. This part demonstrates that, contrary to what many historians of post-war (Western) European socialism claim, there was no across-the-board socialist conversion to a parliamentary road to socialism. Yet, the fault lines between those parties insisting on a strict adherence to the rulebook of political democracy and those advocating a radical departure from representative democracy did not divide neatly between East and West.",1784061075,,Dissertations & Theses," de Graaf, Jan-Arendde GraafJan-Arendde Graaf, Jan-Arend", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017589811 , 103733382 , 101309 , 10086388 , 10086388 , http://eprints.port.ac.uk/18191/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784061075?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.port.ac.uk/18191/ , (UMI)AAI10086388 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Across+the+iron+curtain%3A+european+socialism+between+world+war+and+cold+war%2C+1943-1948&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=de+Graaf%2C+Jan-Arend&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Oil governance in the niger delta: exploring the role of the militias,"This thesis explores the complex voices of militants, associated with the capture of oil resources in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The persistent violent conflict involving militant groups in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a major concern for many within the country and the international community. Understanding the conflict in the Niger Delta has triggered a wide range of discussions and debates among researchers, politicians and policy makers. However, these debates have overlooked the views of the militants, who are actively engaged in the conflict over resource governance in the region. Moreover the ideology of self-determination and resource control, which these militants use to legitimise their actions, seem to generate different meanings and labelling that tend to cloud an understandings of the conflict in the region. In this thesis, I adopt the theoretical assumptions of the New Social Movement literature and the epistemological views of the Interpretivist Social Constructionist approach to explore (a) what features shaped the emergence of militancy and its diverse forms (b) how do militias make sense of their role as militants? (c) how does the role of militias impact on the politics of oil governance in the Niger Delta? I argue that militia actions that appear to challenge the legitimacy and authority of the Nigerian state to control oil resources, are embedded in complex webs involving formal and informal interactions of political elites and militia leaders. From analysis of this research, key dominant concepts such as Identity, opportunism and competition, emerged to give insight as to why and how militancy has become significant in the region.",1792787824,,Dissertations & Theses," Tantua, BenTantuaBenTantua, Ben", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4073826521 , 103733102 , 101309 , 10115429 , 10115429 , http://opus.bath.ac.uk/49310/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1792787824?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://opus.bath.ac.uk/49310/ , (UMI)AAI10115429 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Oil+governance+in+the+niger+delta%3A+exploring+the+role+of+the+militias&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tantua%2C+Ben&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Implicit cognition and the social evaluation of speech,"For the past three decades, psychological research has repeatedly shown that it is not always necessary for us to be conscious of events in order to perceive them, a phenomenon referred to as implicit cognition (Underwood &amp; Bright 1996). Although this has been the subject of much research in the disciplines of psychology and social psychology, sociolinguists have only recently begun to examine how implicit cognition functions with regards to how we perceive speech (Campbell-Kibler 2012). Consistent with social psychology research on implicit responses to visually-derived social information (Greenwald et al 1998; Karpinski &amp; Hilton 2001), recent sociolinguistic research suggests that listeners make differing conscious and unconscious social evaluations upon hearing different regional and foreign-accented speech varieties (Kristiansen 2009; Pantos &amp; Perkins 2013), and that this is at least partly driven by socially-marked phonetic variation (Campbell-Kibler 2012, 2013). While previous research has investigated this phenomenon in relation to different regional or international varieties of English, the current study investigates the conscious and unconscious associations listeners make towards different social accents in Glasgow. This was achieved over three experiments by adapting an established psycholinguistic eye tracking methodology for sociolinguistic research. The first experiment (N=32) was conducted without eye tracking, relying on pencil and paper responses. Participants were tasked with choosing between on-screen ‘working-class’ and ‘middle-class’ target images (determined via a separate norming task) of brand logos and objects while recordings of different speakers uttering words semantically related to both images were heard. Non-significant trends were found in the data, with participants more likely to choose ‘working-class’ brand logos when a working-class speaker was heard and ‘middle-class’ logos when a middle-class speaker was heard. A second experiment (N=42) recorded listener eye movements in real time towards the same experimental stimuli, finding listeners to have been significantly (p &lt; .05) more likely to fixate upon ‘working-class’ brand logos when hearing a working-class speaker than when hearing a middle-class speaker. Listeners’ verbal choices of brand logos showed no significant effect of speaker heard, showing a divergence between the on-line and off-line responses made towards speakers. Conversely, the speaker heard was found to have had a significant (p &lt; .05) effect on the images of objects verbally chosen by listeners, but no effect on fixations made towards objects. A third experiment (N=54) investigated listener fixations towards brand logos while hearing words containing different socially-marked phonetic variants. Socially-marked phonetic realisations of CAT, post-vocalic/post-consonantal /l/, and non-prevocalic /r/ were all found to have elicited significant (p &lt; .05) effects on listener fixation behaviour, with response times ranging from 300-700ms. A supplemental subjective reaction test (N=60) found participants to have evaluated middle-class Glaswegian speakers significantly (p &lt; .05) more favourably in terms of Zahn &amp; Hopper’s (1985) status attributes than working-class Glaswegian speakers, in line with the findings of previous language attitude studies (Preston 1999; Zahn &amp; Hopper 1985; Kristiansen 2001). Overall, the results indicate that speech varieties with varying levels of perceived social status elicit differing conscious and unconscious social evaluations in listeners, and that socially-marked phonetic variation plays a role in this.",1827520606,,Dissertations & Theses," Robertson, DuncanRobertsonDuncanRobertson, Duncan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209460211 , 102699102 , 101309 , 10173054 , 10173054 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7176/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827520606?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7176/ , (UMI)AAI10173054 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Implicit+cognition+and+the+social+evaluation+of+speech&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robertson%2C+Duncan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Surplus citizens: struggles in the greek crisis, 2010-2014","This thesis analyses the social struggles that occurred between 2010 and 2014 during the crisis in Greece: labour struggles, the movement of the squares, demonstrations and riots, neighbourhood assemblies, solidarity projects and economies, local environmental struggles, and anti-fascist and migrants' struggles. It discusses their internal and external limits in the historical specificity of the contemporary crisis and class relation. Drawing critically on Théorie Communiste's periodising schema, these struggles are framed, first, through a shift in the dynamic of the class relation effected by the crisis and the restructuring, which is a continuation of the first phase of 'neoliberal' restructuring in the 1990s. This shift intensified a central capitalist contradiction: while the capital relation imposes most violently the absolute dependence of subsistence on the wage, the wage relation fails to guarantee subsistence and integrates proletarians as surplus to capitalist reproduction. Second, the struggles are framed through the deep political crisis of state sovereignty and the relation between state and civil society, caused by the relentless imposition of the restructuring in conjunction with supranational institutions. These historical transformations are traced through the mutual constitution of international tendencies and the development of class struggle in Greece, against theories of dependency and underdevelopment. Ideological responses to the financial crisis and the logic of the restructuring are interrogated by employing theories of value, fetishism, and the state influenced by the German 'value-form' debate. Foucault-influenced conceptions of governmentality and sovereignty are also deployed to examine the restructuring's forms of imposition and the biopolitical crisis-management strategies of the state, which reinforced the racialised and gendered constitution of civil society. The thesis argues that these two elements, the changing dynamic of the class relation and the crisis of the state and civil society, defined the struggles of this period, in which two core characteristics can be identified. First, labour struggles confronted the dilemma between the necessity and inadequacy of the wage through an ambivalence between their attachment to work and their estrangement from it. This ambivalence did not question the terms of the dilemma posed, which were only questioned fleetingly in riots that interrupted the normality of commodity exchange. Second, the deep political crisis provoked struggles defending democracy, with the disempowered 'Greek citizen' as their central subject, which constitutively excluded migrants. The splitting of these struggles between leftwing anti-imperialist and rightwing anti-immigration nationalism, and into a struggle between fascism and anti-fascism, were not able to challenge this constitutive exclusion, which was only questioned by migrants' own struggles. Nationalism and the drive to reinforce unsettled social hierarchies played into the governmental effort to contain the political crisis, through the state's biopolitical management of the migrant and marginal, racialised and gendered surplus populations produced in the crisis.",1827522096,,Dissertations & Theses," Kotouza, DimitraKotouzaDimitraKotouza, Dimitra", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209465801 , 103716222 , 101309 , 10178303 , 10178303 , http://kar.kent.ac.uk/55614/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827522096?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://kar.kent.ac.uk/55614/ , (UMI)AAI10178303 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Surplus+citizens%3A+struggles+in+the+greek+crisis%2C+2010-2014&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kotouza%2C+Dimitra&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Advers(ary) effects?: investigating the purportedly disabling character of conspiracy theory via analysis of the communicative construction of resistance discourses in online anti-new world order conspiracy theory discussion forums,"This thesis examines how resistance is thought about and discussed within the discursive framework of the New World Order (NWO) conspiracy theory. The literature on conspiracy theories has tended to ignore or even reject the notion that conspiracy theory can be associated with political resistance; it is typically characterised as an individual, intellectual and more or less irrational puzzle-solving endeavour. Furthermore, conspiracy theory has been proposed by its very nature to be disabling (Fenster 1999: xv) and that in the face of a totalising, malevolent global conspiracy, “there is nothing you can do” (Basham 2003: 100). Such admittedly plausible conjectures are largely unsupported by empirical research, and so this thesis seeks to assess the credibility of these claims via a richly detailed discourse analysis of online conspiracy theory discussion forums. I define ‘resistance discourse’ in terms of perceived agency, specifically via discursive constructions of power and morality, across three social groups: heroes, villains and potential supporters. I further propose that these anti-NWO resistance discourses can be analysed in the same way as those of a social movement, and I employ Melucci’s (1989; 1996) concepts of ‘action system’, ‘ideology’ and ‘communicative construction’ to analyse the ways in which perceptions of agency are played out and interact with each other within online conversations. Firstly in cognitive terms, relating to perceptions of the efficacy of any proposed resistance strategy, and secondly in affective terms in relation to whether or not the resistance discourse can be interpreted as empowering or disabling. The primary contribution of the thesis is not the trivially simple demonstration that conspiracy theory can be associated with imagining political resistance. Rather its objective is to demonstrate that the discursive form the conspiracy theory takes, particularly in relation to constructions of the adversary’s power and morality, can result in dramatic discursive shaping and constraining influence on what kinds of strategies of resistance can be conceived, along with the extent to which they are presented as either disabling or empowering.",1827600945,,Dissertations & Theses," Mager, AlexanderMagerAlexanderMager, Alexander", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209788161 , 103451732 , 101309 , 10173165 , 10173165 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3285/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827600945?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3285/ , (UMI)AAI10173165 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Advers%28ary%29+effects%3F%3A+investigating+the+purportedly+disabling+character+of+conspiracy+theory+via+analysis+of+the+communicative+construction+of+resistance+discourses+in+online+anti-new+world+order+conspiracy+theory+discussion+forums&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mager%2C+Alexander&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Carving the exotic: confinement art in bermuda (1824-1994),"This study will examine objects created by prisoners in five specific confinement settings in over a dozen different locations in Bermuda; 19th century Convict Hulks, Boer War, WWI and WWII internment camps, and Casemates maximum-security prison. Artefacts will include cedar, metal, stone, and bone carvings, as well as paintings, textiles, photographs and graffiti. These objects were made and used by prisoners to cope with the physical and psychological effects of confinement. Consequently they are deeply personal and emotive representations of the experience of confinement in Bermuda. Many were also integrated into the local tourism markets and given as gifts. As part of the tourism trade these items became iconic souvenirs of Bermuda, and were popular items among locals and visitors alike. As commodities, these objects enabled interaction between the marginalised communities of prisoners and mainstream society. This movement from the private and restricted landscapes of the prison into the public sphere of tourism enabled these objects to acquire meanings and associations separated from their manufacture and use in the prisons and camps. Often these items were kept in family collections and became heirlooms representative of specific family members and histories. As these objects have been separated temporally from their confinement origins, they have become valued as historical souvenirs and embedded within cultural heritage displays and constructions of national identities. These diverse narratives and trajectories have meant that these objects are complex and often hold multiple meanings for a range of people. As all of these artefacts are not only symbolic of the personal experiences of prisoners in the prison landscape, but are also integrated into local constructions of community and identity and international histories of confinement, this study will utilise a multi-disciplinary approach to reveal the variety of meanings that these objects hold for different people. This study will examine these objects as one collection of confinement art and identify how they were made, sold, collected, and displayed, in order to create a picture of Bermuda confinement art over time. As the artefacts are created within very different time periods and associated with a variety of confinement settings and locations, the cultural and social implications of these artefacts will be examined in order to chart changing perceptions of confinement and confinement art in Bermuda. Thus, this study aims to enable a greater understanding of the importance of confinement art to prisoners and non-prisoners, and the role that confinement art plays within constructions of individual, community, and national identities.",1827869970,,Dissertations & Theses," Atwood, Deborah A.AtwoodA.DeborahAtwood, Deborah A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4211385151 , 103890502 , 101309 , 10180124 , 10180124", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827869970?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10180124 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Carving+the+exotic%3A+confinement+art+in+bermuda+%281824-1994%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Atwood%2C+Deborah+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Managing aquatic non-native species: the role of biosecurity,"Across the globe, invasive non-native species (INNS) are a major ecological and economic problem with freshwater environments particularly susceptible to their impacts. Preventing their introduction and spread is considered the most environmentally desirable and cost-effective form of management by the Convention on Biological Diversity, and is advocated in new EU INNS legislation which comes into force in 2015. Biosecurity – a term describing actions taken to prevent the introduction and spread of unwanted organisms – is central to this preventative approach. This PhD combines ecological and social research to identify human-mediated pathways for the spread of INNS in freshwater environments; to examine the effectiveness of biosecurity measures; and to identify how biosecurity awareness and compliance could be improved. Initial questionnaire research revealed that recreational water users in the UK are potential vectors for INNS due to their movement patterns and low biosecurity compliance. A survival experiment showed that many aquatic INNS threatening the UK can survive in damp conditions for 16 days but demonstrated that hot water (45˚C, 15 mins) is an effective biosecurity control measure, causing 99% mortality in many high risk INNS within 1 hour. As a result of a long-term biosecurity campaign, New Zealand water users had high biosecurity awareness and compliance compared to the UK. The development of regional partnerships and the support of national legislation were key components of the country’s streamlined approach to biosecurity. Invasive non-native crayfish had a significantly lower diversity and prevalence of parasites than native crayfish in the UK, supporting the concept of enemy release. Finally, a global meta-analysis revealed that recreational activities also act as vectors for the introduction of INNS in terrestrial and marine environments and require biosecurity measures of a similar magnitude. The results provide an evidence base from which to develop freshwater biosecurity strategies in the UK and wider Europe.",1857754723,,Dissertations & Theses," Anderson, Lucy GraceAndersonGraceLucyAnderson, Lucy Grace", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4299216821 , 103716162 , 101309 , 10137051 , 10137051 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/8679/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1857754723?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/8679/ , (UMI)AAI10137051 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Managing+aquatic+non-native+species%3A+the+role+of+biosecurity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anderson%2C+Lucy+Grace&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The struggle for democracy in pakistan: nonviolent resistance of military rule 1977-88,"Pakistan is regarded widely today as a country continuing turmoil, in which multiple centres of political and armed power compete with each other, using violence as much as due democratic processes to settle their differences. And yet, as this dissertation seeks to show, there is also a tradition of democracy that has been fought for and won in ongoing nonviolent movements For almost half its life since its creation in 1947, military dictators, of whom there have been four in all, have ruled Pakistan. Amongst these, General Zia-ul-Haq ruled the longest at more than eleven years from July 1977 to August 1988. He not only executed Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan former Prime Minister but he was also able to bring about fundamental changes in the legal, political, religious, social and cultural affairs of the country. His rule is often considered a ‘dark age’ in the history of Pakistan. Two movements – the campaign to save Bhutto 1977-1979 and the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD) 1981-1988 – were launched and led by political parties, of which the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) was leading member, against Zia’s rule. Historians have generally considered both these movements to have been a failure. In this dissertation, it is argued that although MRD took much longer than the originally-envisaged three months to achieve its aim, it did not in the end fail. It should, rather, be seen as a gradualist democratic movement, which eventually brought the country back to democracy in 1988. The process took longer than expected for several reasons, the most important of which were a lack of unity amongst the leaders of its constituent political parties, particularly the PPP, the absence of an operational corps, and Zia-ul-Haq’s ruthless response to the nonviolent resistance to his rule. Additionally, Zia’s regime was supported for many years by international powers of the Western bloc, due to the war against Soviet Union in Afghanistan.",1865277820,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahmad, Malik HammadAhmadHammadMalikAhmad, Malik Hammad", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4312295441 , 103733252 , 101309 , 10137148 , 10137148 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/77074/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865277820?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/77074/ , (UMI)AAI10137148 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+struggle+for+democracy+in+pakistan%3A+nonviolent+resistance+of+military+rule+1977-88&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmad%2C+Malik+Hammad&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Solutions to spatial and computational challenges for large-landscape conservation planning,"Systematic conservation planning is a fertile scientific discipline capable of examining global natural resource threats including land cover conversion, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Many of these threats are acting in concert to accelerate the rate of change which increases the urgency of action. The scale of these changes creates unique spatial analysis and computational challenges. This study was designed to address several of these challenges pertaining to the analyses of publicly protected areas, habitat connectivity, and private lands conservation. I examine how using high-throughput and high-performance computing helps conservation practitioners ask and solve larger ecological questions. I describe when practitioners might consider using these technologies based on the types of questions that are asked. I improve upon existing circuit-theory based habitat connectivity modeling by using parallel processing and develop new methodologies which facilitate fine-grained analyses over broad geographic extents. I explore how species-level habitat connectivity can inform broad patterns of current and future landscape connectivity in the southeastern U.S. by incorporating species with a diverse group of dispersal abilities and including forecasted threats to connectivity. Since most of the conservation lands in the eastern U.S. are privately-owned, I explore the spatial patterns, distribution, and social covariates around private lands conservation (e.g., easements) throughout the Appalachian region. Harnessing the power of high-throughput and high-performance computing facilitated a 72-125 times speedup for several large-landscape spatial analyses. These improvements arm researches with the ability to ask questions which more closely capture the complexity seen in nature. Circuit-theory based habitat connectivity is notoriously computationally expensive and the results presented herein suggest computational bottlenecks can be overcome with a 160 times speedup. Moreover, the results illustrated circuit-theory based connectivity maps converge on a near solution much faster than previously thought and thus the description of this ‘convergence factor’ will save researchers many hours of computation and make broad-extent analyses practicable. Species-derived connectivity maps indicate far fewer large contiguous areas will be available to facilitate animal movements across ecoregions in 2100. Overall species potential habitat cores were reduced by 36% reaching as high as 72% for one species. I observed a more simplified landscape connectivity in 2100 where values were dissected and depleted for the highest quantiles. Despite these discouraging findings, private lands conservation may provide a ‘stop-gap’ measure to slow these changes. I found conservation easements throughput Appalachia nearer to urban developments, major road networks, on arable lands, and surrounded by areas of higher diversity than random. These results differ from that of global protected areas but the drivers of easement location may be more tightly linked with social processes, rather than environmental ones. Collectively, this research can help guide practitioners about what science and technology is needed and at the appropriate scale to match their conservation questions. Although the increasing threats to biodiversity conservation are well documented, strategies such as those presented here may help facilitate positive conservation outcomes.",1873090134,,Dissertations & Theses," Leonard, Paul BrandonLeonardBrandonPaulLeonard, Paul Brandon", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317749301 , 99582572 , 66569 , 9781369549638 , 10187040 , 10187040", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781369549638, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873090134?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0408 Conservation"," 0329 Ecology , 0408 Conservation"," 0329 Ecology , 0408 Conservation",," 0329 Ecology , 0408 Conservation"," Ecology , Conservation"," Biological sciences , Connectivity , Conservation planning , Gene flow",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solutions+to+spatial+and+computational+challenges+for+large-landscape+conservation+planning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leonard%2C+Paul+Brandon&amp;isbn=9781369549638&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The road to where?: a political ecology of post-neoliberalism: negotiations of extractive-led development, indigeneity and conservation in the isiboro secure indigenous territory and national park (tipnis), bolivia","This thesis is concerned with the demands that humans are placing on the planet. Such demands are interrogated in long-running debates about how to reconcile the tensions between development, as an immanent process of capitalist expansion (see Cowen &amp; Shelton 1996), and the environment, taken broadly in reference to finite natural resources, landscapes and wildlife. As environmental issues become increasingly prominent in local struggles, national debates, and international policies and programmes, we need to be paying more attention to how they are produced and shaped by politics and power relations, as well as to the differences between how groups relate to their biophysical environments. In this thesis, I do this by investigating the political ecology of post-neoliberalism in Bolivia. The country has been heralded as one of the most radical political projects in Latin America and a reformed state is being implemented in the name of radical politics and revolution, appropriating discourses of indigeneity and social movements. Here, the state has blamed the global environmental crisis on the continuing dominance of capitalism and neoliberalism. This has been publically rejected by the state, whilst new ‘post-neoliberal’ forms of development and harmonious relationships between people and nature have been promoted. However, Bolivia’s post-neoliberal state project has become increasingly dependent on hydrocarbon extraction becoming the most natural resource-dependent country in the region. This has created new sites of contestation and conflict between citizens and the state, as well as complicating what the Bolivian case contributes to wider debates about development and the environment. In this project I research an ongoing conflict over the Isiboro Secure Indigenous Territory and National Park (TIPNIS) concentrating on the key themes of development, environment and indigeneity. This political ecology of post-neoliberalism contributes both to our understanding of this emerging political project and to broader debates about human/nature relationships - by questioning the dynamics of fringe politics. This means questioning how the terms and content of ‘alternatives’ and ‘radical’ politics are set and how this in turn shapes the possibilities for transformative paths towards more sustainable human/nature relationships.",1885883956,,Dissertations & Theses," Hope, Jessica ChloeHopeChloeJessicaHope, Jessica Chloe", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321573175 , 102699132 , 101309 , 10588862 , 10588862 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:276965", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1885883956?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:276965 , (UMI)AAI10588862 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+road+to+where%3F%3A+a+political+ecology+of+post-neoliberalism%3A+negotiations+of+extractive-led+development%2C+indigeneity+and+conservation+in+the+isiboro+secure+indigenous+territory+and+national+park+%28tipnis%29%2C+bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hope%2C+Jessica+Chloe&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The cultural contradictions of anti-capitalism: globalisation, resistance and the limits of liberalism","This thesis seeks to explore the cultural tendencies of contemporary anti-capitalism by relating such tendencies to the wider cultural context. It is argued that contemporary anti-capitalist movements such as the Occupy movement are marked by a self-emancipatory ethos that emerges as an inherent feature of a global society pervaded by Western­ bourgeois cultural tendencies. It is argued that the self-emancipatory ethos is constituted by an essential contradiction, simultaneously bringing out being-over desires (or desires for power over humanity and nature) and being-with desires, (or desires for horizontal connections or associations with humanity and nature). Employing a post-structuralist perspective and insisting on the improbability of cultural transcendence, the thesis suggests that contemporary anti-capitalist movements tend to radicalise, rather than absolutely oppose, Western-bourgeois cultural tendencies, and explores how radical groups feed radical undercurrents into the liberal-democratic mainstream to contribute to the development of Western society. In developing the concept of self-emancipatory contradiction, the thesis seeks to radicalise the philosophical perspective employed by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. It traces these authors' philosophical perspective back to the philosophy of desire developed by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in the late 1960s and early 1970s, linking this philosophy to the political and social upheavals that developed from the revolt of May 1968 in France. While insisting that Deleuze and Guattari helped usher in a postmodern break in the 1960s, the thesis seeks to place this break within the history of self-emancipatory struggle in the West, exploring how the break exacerbated the self-emancipatory contradiction to feed into the development of neoliberal culture from the late 1970s onwards. In placing the postmodern break in its cultural context, the thesis explores the origins and early development of the Western-bourgeois ethos of self-emancipation, focusing on early liberalist philosophy and key democratising political upheavals in Western history.",1896024684,,Dissertations & Theses," Fletcher, Daniel KevinFletcherKevinDanielFletcher, Daniel Kevin", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322228291 , 103733222 , 101309 , 10594412 , 10594412 , http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/2727/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896024684?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/2727/ , (UMI)AAI10594412 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+cultural+contradictions+of+anti-capitalism%3A+globalisation%2C+resistance+and+the+limits+of+liberalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fletcher%2C+Daniel+Kevin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dynamique spatio-temporelle de la pêche au homard aux îles de la Madeleine dans le cadre d'une étude de réalisation d'une aire marine protégée,"Dans le contexte de la gestion écosystémique des espaces maritimes, l’identification des processus spatio-temporels des pêcheries devient un concept-clé. Ainsi, l’exploitation du homard ( Homarus americanus ) aux îles de la Madeleine est particulièrement intéressante car, d’une part, il s’agit d’une activité économique de première importance et, d’autre part, la possibilité de création d’une aire marine protégée dans cette région nécessite une meilleure compréhension des interactions possibles entre la conservation et le maintien des activités halieutiques. Étant donné que les informations précises sur la répartition spatiale de l’effort de pêche et de l’abondance du homard sont manquantes, l’approche utilisée consiste à combiner deux savoirs. Le premier relève de l’expérience des pêcheurs locaux et le second provient des données de débarquements par port. La complémentarité de ces démarches permet d’obtenir une vision globale et intégrée de l’utilisation du territoire marin en termes d’espace de production et d’espace propice à la conservation. Les grandes tendances spatio-temporelles observées démontrent une contraction de l’espace de production ainsi que de la période d’activité en mer de la flottille des homardiers depuis les années 1980. Une tendance à l’augmentation des rendements exprimés en prise (kg) par unité d’effort (casier levé) (PUE) a été observée entre les années 1985 à 2012. Cette tendance annuelle se rapporte à l’échelle saisonnière où les profils de PUE s’accentuent démontrant une réduction plus rapide au fil de la saison. Les modifications de stratégie de pêche au fil des années ainsi que la migration des pêcheurs d’un port à l’autre semblent influencer la structure des PUE.

To begin, I will attempt to outline the various dimensions of the phenomenon of globalization and the drug war, more specifically, and how the latter is a consequence of certain negative aspects of the former. Secondly, an ethical-political critique from a view of Christian salvation will be conducted as it pertains to this particular conflict, principally but not exclusively in its social sense. My method and epistemological approach will be guided by what has been called the transmodern thought of Enrique Dussel and Hans Urs von Balthasar, respectively – Dussel with regard to historical and ethical-political concerns, and von Balthasar with special attention to his theological aesthetics and dramatics. Dussel’s re-reading of the history of modernity from the critical perspective of Latin American experience of colonial-capitalism, as well as his social appropriation of Levinas and arguably Schellingian-Marxian interpretation of economic relations, will be the primary lens through which I will try to situate and appreciate the problems posed by globalization and the drug war itself. Subsequently, in an effort to sensitize Dussel’s approach to a view from “the eyes of faith”, it is von Balthasar’s meditation on the beauty of the Christ-form that will be appropriated in order to convey a less anthropocentric and more global, thoroughgoing Christian theo-political imagination. The study will culminate in an attempt to synthesize several key contributions of Dussel and von Balthasar by drawing on certain soteriological of Jon Sobrino and Mark Lewis Taylor's constructive analysis of ""critical movements of resistance"". Finally, to think concretely about an ecclesial Christian response that embodies neighborliness, several recent popular protests and resistance efforts in Mexico and Central America will be studied as examples of what form this neighborliness might take.",1789629152,,Dissertations & Theses," Walker, William A., IIIWalkerA.WilliamIIIWalker, William A., III", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4059715061 , 104786882 , 66569 , 9781339679983 , 10104464 , 10104464", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339679983, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1789629152?accountid=14496," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0469 Theology"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0469 Theology"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0469 Theology",," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0469 Theology"," Religion , Philosophy , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Ecclesiology , Globalization , Mexican drug war , Political theology , Soteriology , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Globalization%2C+Violence+and+Salvation%3A+Toward+a+Transmodern+Political+Theology+of+Neighborliness+and+Resistance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walker%2C+William+A.%2C+III&amp;isbn=9781339679983&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Spectacular Struggles: Utopian Whiteness, Black Resistance, and the National Imaginary in Nineteenth-Century America","Through an analysis of the popularity, didacticism, and rhetoric of literary utopias and world’s fairs, Spectacular Struggles argues that during the latter half of the nineteenth century our national narrative makes use of an inherently and uncritically white utopian form to forge an exclusionary, white national identity as an anxious response to a tumultuous era of social change. The first chapter traces the origins of this “white (male) utopian complex” from More’s sui generis Utopia to the white utopian frameworks governing our self-representation at the fair, national narratives, and even our histories. From this grounding, I turn to Edgar Allen Poe’s quirky, yet poignant “Mellonta Tauta” (1850) and Hawthorne’s The Blithedale Romance (1852), before focusing on Edward Bellamy’s oft-centralized Looking Backward (1889). Through this comparison, I map the rise of the white male utopian complex within our historiography in contrast to a paralleled and metacritical utopian voice excluded from this historiography. To further highlight the canon’s white utopian complex, chapter two turns to America’s premier, most nationalistic, and most overtly-racialized fairscape, the World’s Columbian Exposition (1893). While chapter one looks to the way in which the Philadelphia’s Centennial International Exhibition (1876) informs Bellamy’s architectural imagining of the future and helps to establish the fairscape’s relationship to the literary utopia, chapter two looks at the role the Columbian Exposition plays in institutionalizing and nationalizing a neoclassical white aesthetic not merely for architecture or art or literature, but for national identity. I focus here on the fair’s “White City” as a racialized articulation of the “City Beautiful” movement in literature, architecture, and ultimately urban planning. I argue that the salience of the “race question” at these spectacular nationalized utopias highlights utopian scholarship’s avoidance of race history and how such an omission skews the historiography of the period. With an eye toward recasting race history as central to this historiography, chapters three and four take up two under-discussed bodies of utopian literature: the Southern utopia and the African America utopia. Chapter three argues that we’ve long overlooked utopias set in the South or written by Southerners precisely because they, like the fairs held therein, aggressively and openly reassert whites’ proprietary claims over the South’s history and its future. These oft-excluded white supremacist utopias not only advance a more militant Anglo-Saxon national identity, but they inform a Southern fairscape that sentimentally rewrites the Old South by forcibly whitewashing the New. In contrast to the previous chapter’s focus on white supremacist works, chapter four argues that a nascent black nationalism begins to emerge in black spectacular fictions that appear at the century’s end and that these fictions collectively reclaim an American past, present, and future in which black Americans play an integral role. I argue that these black utopists use the hybridity of the utopian form to articulate a black philosophy, history, and critical study of whiteness that simultaneously exposes how the inherent whiteness of the utopian form has long-advanced within the national imaginary an American utopia contingent upon its whiteness. Spectacular Struggles offers a starting point for recovering a previously-evaded race history and significant body of utopian works long pushed to the margins of the contemporary canon. It offers a starting point for acknowledging how the racially-unmarked historiography presently defining the scope of utopian study distorts a nineteenth-century reality.",1794167610,,Dissertations & Theses," Novosat, Courtney L.NovosatL.CourtneyNovosat, Courtney L.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4079354751 , 105206342 , 66569 , 9781339734019 , 10110141 , 10110141", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339734019, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794167610?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0591 American literature"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0591 American literature"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0591 American literature",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0328 Black history , 0591 American literature"," African American Studies , American studies , Black history , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , African-American , American literature , Bellamy, Edward , Hawthorne, Nathaniel , Literature , Nineteenth century , Poe, Edgar Allan , Utopian literature , World's fairs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spectacular+Struggles%3A+Utopian+Whiteness%2C+Black+Resistance%2C+and+the+National+Imaginary+in+Nineteenth-Century+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Novosat%2C+Courtney+L.&amp;isbn=9781339734019&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The challenges of managing an international branch campus: an exploratory study,"This thesis is a study of the challenges of managing an international branch campus (IBC) of a UK university. Branch or satellite campuses are not a new phenomenon. Within the UK, the Universities of Leicester, Nottingham and Southampton all began as university colleges of the University of London, teaching a prescribed curriculum and acting as an examination centre for the University of London. Ironically perhaps, over a century after London provided higher education to the provinces, at least 13 provincial universities currently operate branch campuses in the capital, including Glasgow Caledonian University and the Universities of Liverpool, Cumbria, South Wales and Ulster (Quality Assurance Agency 2014). Internationally, the University of Ceylon (now separated into the Universities of Colombo, Peradeniya, Vidyodaya and Kelaniya) was also set up as an international college of the University of London. After World War II, a number of Commonwealth university colleges of the University of London were established under the ‘scheme of special relationships’. These colleges offered University of London degrees and were provided with academic support to develop their systems and procedures so that they could eventually become independent. The group of Commonwealth colleges in the special relationship included the predecessors of today’s Universities of Ibadan, Nairobi, West Indies and Zimbabwe (Harte 1986). The current wave of IBCs is, however, different from the university colleges of yesteryear in two important respects. First, today’s IBCs are the private initiatives of UK universities, rather than part of a wider development policy agenda driven by the UK or a foreign colonial government. Second, the IBCs are privately owned, either wholly or jointly by the UK universities, rather than being public institutions set up by a government. This is reflected in the titles of the new IBCs which either position them as an extension of the UK university (eg, University of Reading Malaysia, University of Middlesex Dubai) or highlight the nature of the educational partnership (eg, International University of Malaya Wales, Xi’an Jaiotong Liverpool University). The common thread connecting today’s IBCs to the past is that they follow the historical 8 convention of teaching curricula designed in the UK and awarding the degrees of the home university. The 21st century version of the IBC is a relatively recent phenomenon. Prior to the conclusion of the ‘Uruguay Round’ of trade talks and the establishment of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in 1995, non-tariff barriers effectively precluded trade in educational services in most markets. The oldest ‘modern’ IBC is the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, which was set up in 2000. Most of the UK’s IBC’s have been established only in the last ten years and a number ─ for example, the University of Reading Malaysia and Heriot-Watt University Malaysia ─ are still in their infancy. Building and operating an IBC represents a ‘brave new frontier’ for UK universities and this thesis sheds important light on the challenges involved. The international strategy literature provides a valuable conceptual framework within which to organise these challenges. The globalisation of business is far more advanced than that of higher education and the management models much better understood. Multinational corporations (MNCs) have developed sophisticated techniques for managing extensive networks of overseas subsidiaries and have dedicated functional departments to oversee the movement of labour, goods, services and capital across national borders. A fundamental challenge for MNCs is to determine how much to localise their product or service to meet the needs of each national market. Universities face the same dilemma with their IBCs. Should they be ‘clones’ of the home campus, providing an educational experience which is identical to that on the home campus? Or should they localise the curriculum and pedagogy to adapt to the learning styles and context of the host market? Unlike MNCs, however, UK universities are not huge corporations with HR and finance departments accustomed to dealing with transfer pricing, international tax issues and managing internationally mobile staff. They are stolid, UK-based organisations with a public sector ethos and a tradition of being managed by academics, rather than professional career managers. They are characterised by arcane governance structures, internal politics and glacial decision-making. More than half the UK universities (ie, 9 the former polytechnics and colleges of higher education) have been independent of local government control for less than 25 years and many still operate on the basis of employment contracts and working practices from this era. The scale of the IBCs relative to their UK campuses is, moreover, generally so small that the organisational ‘centre of gravity’ is overwhelmingly the UK-based operation. A second difference between MNCs’ subsidiaries and IBCs is that, despite the advent of GATS, higher education remains a highly regulated sector. UK universities are subject to oversight by the national Higher Education Funding Councils, the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA). When they establish IBCs which provide UK degrees, the IBCs are subject to the same scrutiny by the QAA. At the same time, IBCs are regulated by the equivalent bodies in the host country, either arms-length organisations like the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) or the host Ministry of Education. Governments in many countries subsidise higher education, either indirectly by providing students with grants or loans to contribute towards tuition costs or directly by subsidising universities or operating them as part of the public sector. To control the cost to the taxpayer, they often impose enrolment caps; to meet public good objectives, governments may use a range of levers from moral suasion to purpose-specific grants to steer universities to admit students from underrepresented backgrounds or undertake research in particular areas. At the very least, IBCs must compete with subsidised, regulated local universities, but often they themselves are subject to the same regulation and control. Because of these two important differences between MNCs and universities, the focus of this study is on the challenges of managing an IBC as perceived by the IBC managers. While there is a well-developed literature on principal-agent theory, much of the international strategy literature on localisation approaches the problem from an organisational perspective; that is, it couches the challenge to the MNC as an entity of determining the optimal degree of localisation. In the case of an IBC, the senior management of the home university may similarly take a view, in principle, of the optimal degree of localisation of the curriculum. But because the management systems of a UK university are so underdeveloped in terms of controlling a small IBC thousands of kilometres away, and because there are other equally powerful stakeholders in the 10 host country involved, it is the IBC manager in situ who has to balance these competing demands. This study uses critical realism as the conceptual framework. This is because IBC managers are operating in the context of hard objective, external facts (government regulations, enrolment targets, financial budgets), but they nevertheless have to construct their own understanding of their objectives within the context of the wider social structures and power relations. For IBC managers, they are working in an alien culture where they may not speak the local language or fully comprehend the social norms and conventions. They have to work out what they think are the agendas of the host government, their joint venture partner and their competitors and what they believe their students want. They also have to interpret the home university’s objectives, which may be vague or ambiguous given the differing objectives of the most senior leaders (eg, the pro vice-chancellor teaching and learning is likely to take a different view from the chief financial officer about the objectives of the IBC) and the shifting political alliances in the senior management team. Using semi-structured interviews with IBC managers, mostly in their own offices at the IBC, this thesis finds that the managers feel pressure to localise the staff base, the curriculum (broadly defined to embrace content, pedagogy and assessment) and research. This pressure emanates from five main clusters of stakeholders: the home university, the joint venture partner, the host country (government, regulators and employers), competitors and students.",1794975200,,Dissertations & Theses," Healey, NigelHealeyNigelHealey, Nigel", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4082613501 , 105094792 , 101309 , 10121657 , 10121657 , http://opus.bath.ac.uk/48944/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794975200?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://opus.bath.ac.uk/48944/ , (UMI)AAI10121657 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+challenges+of+managing+an+international+branch+campus%3A+an+exploratory+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Healey%2C+Nigel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Privatizing Chicago: The politics of urban redevelopment in public housing reforms,"In the early 2000s, Chicago emerged as an archetypal city in the broader movement to remake public housing. Chicago’s Plan for Transformation committed upwards of $1.5 billion to demolish high-rise buildings, rehabilitate a portion of existing stock, and create 12 new mixed-income developments on the footprint of public housing sites. Policy incentives—such as financing for capital development, long-term rental subsidies, and public land transfers—aimed to encourage public-private partnerships. During the 2008 economic crisis and its aftermath, however, the promised transformation proved financially difficult—if not impossible in certain geographic areas—to complete at the scale intended. That shift in the economic context, along with subsequent political responses, thoroughly altered the policy strategy. To date few empirical investigations have analyzed how these changes restructured the very nature of public housing reforms, and what this restructuring means for policies that require market intervention for the provision of public goods. This dissertation performs just that empirical analysis. Privatizing Chicago examines the city’s public housing reforms as an example of “actually existing” (Brenner &amp; Theodore, 2002) neoliberal urbanism and explains how specific political actors, processes, and institutions altered market-based policies intended to reshape urban poor neighborhoods. Viewing Chicago as a neoliberal city requires both recognizing its political landscape as one where the primary aim of municipal government is to promote an entrepreneurial agenda that positions the economic success of the city above all other interests, as well as viewing the potential for progressive movements to contest this agenda. Prior to this study, Chicago’s reforms had not been examined across time or geographic areas using critiques of neoliberal urbanism, nor through qualitative methods. This study fills that gap and uses the case of Chicago to improve the empirical understanding of neoliberal urbanism more generally. The study accomplishes this through a case study of Chicago’s public housing reforms between 2000 to 2016. It shows how government officials, real estate developers, bankers, lawyers, planners, grassroots activists, and others pursued policy strategies favorable to their interests over a 16-year period—a time marked by the economic recession. My methodological approach is a theory-driven form of ethnography, and my analysis draws from 61 in-depth interviews, field observations over 22 months, archival research of over 500 documents, and the analysis of financial data. This approach brought to light the multiple and contradictory visions at work within the neoliberal framework: competing ideas of the proper partnerships between the public and private sectors, shifting authority among local and national government agencies, and struggles for community redevelopment on the land where high-rises once stood. In probing these conflicts and contradictions, I argue that the overall effect of the reforms was to burnish Chicago’s status as a “global city,” but it also contributed to land appropriation, capital accumulation, and the displacement of thousands of low-income African-American residents. The cycle of government intervention into market failure will continue as long as the role of the state remains dominated by an agenda of capital expansion, rather than of equitable urban development that ensures a place for low-income, predominately racial minority communities to live. Theoretical contributions related to neoliberal urbanism align around four themes: (a) political agency and resistance; (b) privatization and financialization; (c) local state control, federal devolution, and global processes; and (d) the relevance of race. A set of policy implications drives towards recommendations regarding affordable housing policy, democratic governance arrangements, collective action focused on social justice, and market-based policy strategies.",1799650562,,Dissertations & Theses," Khare, Amy TurnbullKhareTurnbullAmyKhare, Amy Turnbull", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4101592261 , 106094892 , 66569 , 9781339874494 , 10129558 , 10129558", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339874494, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1799650562?accountid=14496," 0452 Social work , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0452 Social work , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0452 Social work , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning",," 0452 Social work , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," Social work , Public policy , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Chicago , Policy reform , Political economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privatizing+Chicago%3A+The+politics+of+urban+redevelopment+in+public+housing+reforms&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khare%2C+Amy+Turnbull&amp;isbn=9781339874494&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Sounding rural modernities: Gender, performance, and the body in Assam, India","This dissertation moves beyond cosmopolitan centers to focus on how young people in rural India engage with global media networks by investigating the intersections between gender, youth, and performance. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the northeastern Indian state of Assam since 2009, I explore performances of music and dance associated with the springtime bihu New Year’s festival. I demonstrate how bihu is more than a celebration of fertility and the beginning of the agricultural cycle. By engaging with performers who move between ritual contexts, festival stages, and reality television competitions, I recognize the embodied sounds of bihu as constitutive of gendered and contested spaces where social, economic and geopolitical anxieties play out on the world stage. But I also investigate bihu as a context in which relationships are cultivated and affirmed between families and friends, between humans and the natural world, and between individual selves and multiple imagined communities. Theorizing bihu as “sounded practice,” I approach the study of performance through an investigation of sounded movement that seeks to avoid common binaries such as music/dance and melody/rhythm. As the subject of highly gendered debates about cultural authenticity, bihu constitutes an arena in which the sounding, moving body serves as evidence of regional belonging. Urban music and dance schools, university folklore departments, and state cultural institutions situate bihu as constitutive of a broader folk sensibility that spans seasonal and life cycle ritual contexts, commercial music markets, and university student politics. I argue that this vernacular sounded practice provides young people with opportunities to experiment with socially determined boundaries of gender and sexuality, to learn how to navigate risks, and to bridge seemingly incommensurable media worlds. In so doing, my work challenges and advances scholarly discussions of youth culture and media in South Asian communities as well as postcolonial analyses of gender and liberalization in a broader geopolitical context.",1800283092,,Dissertations & Theses," Kheshgi, RehannaKheshgiRehannaKheshgi, Rehanna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4103638911 , 106140372 , 66569 , 9781339872964 , 10129405 , 10129405", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339872964, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1800283092?accountid=14496," 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0378 Dance , 0413 Music , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Dance , Music , South Asian Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Dance , Embodiment , Ethnomusicology , Gender , Music , South Asia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sounding+rural+modernities%3A+Gender%2C+performance%2C+and+the+body+in+Assam%2C+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kheshgi%2C+Rehanna&amp;isbn=9781339872964&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Romance networks: Aspiration &amp;amp; desire in today's digital culture,"Genres like romance have long been seen as nodes of cultural conversation that negotiate broader social tensions around women’s lives and desires. As media industries increasingly design products to function across media platforms and serve as part of larger transmedia franchises, the technological and market structures which once helped to separate different areas of media production are becoming more porous. This project addresses the movement of audiences, texts, and creators across platforms and considers the ways popular genres and their various sub-categories work at both micro and macro levels. This project focuses on four specific production networks for romantic content: commercial romance literature, romantic fan writing, romantic comedy films, and television's reality wedding shows. Each mode of production I examine in this project seeks to represent certain experiences of love and partnership, constructing different romantic ""packages"" from which audiences select. Each also struggles to accommodate different audience experiences and negotiate cultural tensions. The first two chapters emphasize the erotic fantasies available to romance readers, exploring ways digital reading and production has led to an expansion of romance categories, more explicit content, and is facilitating amateur and non-commercial production. I argue that commercial and fan romances are linked systems of cultural production, each interested in narratives focused on love, desire, and partnership. Next, the focus shifts to moving images, looking at the narrative structures of popular film and television romances and the way they organize women’s aspirational fantasies. Here, high production costs and global distribution produce complicated relationships between media producers and their revenue sources: advertisers and audiences. I argue that these shifts in content and narrative structure reflect evolving strategies for navigating divergent audience communities and ideological views and maintaining existing political and economic systems. Rather than taking a taxonomic approach to genre, this dissertation argues that genre is a broad process of cultural mediation, extending across media forms and beyond any single commercial market. The project positions romance as a diverse cultural conversation distributed across a complicated network of texts and media platforms. Taking this wider and more discursive approach to romance genres is crucial to this investigation into the ways that collisions between culture, technology, and commerce shape the fantasies presented in romantic stories.",1807394751,,Dissertations & Theses," Morrissey, Katherine E.MorrisseyE.KatherineMorrissey, Katherine E.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4130804791 , 105804722 , 66569 , 9781339827971 , 10124698 , 10124698", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339827971, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1807394751?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Film studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0900 Film studies"," Womens studies , British and Irish literature , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Cultural studies , Fan studies , Genre studies , Media studies , Romance , Television studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Romance+networks%3A+Aspiration+%26amp%3B+desire+in+today%27s+digital%0Aculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morrissey%2C+Katherine+E.&amp;isbn=9781339827971&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Everyday mobilities, place and spirituality: constructing subjective spiritual geographies in contemporary bristol, uk","The New Mobilities Paradigm (Urry, 2007) and contemporary geographies understand places as sites of movement and flow that are dynamically related to other spaces (Massey, 1994). However religious places are traditionally treated as static or fixed entities and privilege institutional, rather than personal, spatialities of religion. As contemporary sociologies of religion (Heelas and Woodhead, 2005; Davie, 2006) recognise a shift from communal obligation models of social life to an emphasis on personal fulfilment and wellbeing, geographies of religion (Kong, 2010) have also addressed the individual’s spiritual practices and beliefs outside of the ‘official’ institutional spaces of religion. This research examined the interaction between everyday mobilities and personal spiritual practices of Baptist church and Buddhist meditation centre attendees using a mixed methods approach (participant-observation; questionnaires; diary-interviews) to evidence a variety of practices at home, work, recreation and the journeys made between such sites. Local and global flows of virtual, communicative and imagined mobilities in the churches and meditation centres were also identified. Participants were found to thread together a variety of sites on their everyday time-space paths into what I term ‘subjective spiritual geographies’ in which they could engage and maintain their spiritual practices and beliefs. Participants drew upon a wide range of materials and mobilities in both pre-planned ‘strategic’ and improvised ‘tactical’ sets of response to situations and in doing so created critical spaces of contemporary secular, mobilities infiltrated society. The thesis contributes to existing geographies of religion literature by evidencing the personal spiritual practices of the individual as well as local and global scales of religious places of congregation. It builds upon this literature by suggesting the implication of a range of mobilities is a key component in constructing places for spiritual practices and destabilises assumptions of the identity and distinction between ‘religious’ and ‘secular’ spaces.",1810881379,,Dissertations & Theses," Wigley, EdwardWigleyEdwardWigley, Edward", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4145043431 , 105094892 , 101309 , 10134457 , 10134457 , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/27111/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810881379?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/27111/ , (UMI)AAI10134457 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Everyday+mobilities%2C+place+and+spirituality%3A+constructing+subjective+spiritual+geographies+in+contemporary+bristol%2C+uk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wigley%2C+Edward&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Expressivism in America,"This dissertation re-opens the literary-theoretical debate about the expressivity of American literature, arguing that this debate needs to be recontextualized within a broader cultural history of self-expression as a practice. Whereas literary theory has tended to insist that the identification of literature with subjective expression is a mystification, I show that self-expression, as a concrete form of interactional practice, continues to shape criticism, and American culture in general, in ways that have yet to be fully analyzed. Inverting the familiar theoretical account of expression, which understands that term as reflecting subjects' desire to make their inner selves transparent to the outside world, I argue instead that self-expression is an ethical technique through which subjects assent to their own mediated-ness in order to cope with the moral, political, and symbolic predicaments of a modern textual world. Chapter One reinterprets the American Renaissance as an episode in the reorganization of the American public sphere around the practice of self-expression. Emerson and Thoreau made expression a central theme of their writings not because they were expressivists, but in order to draw attention to the relative imperfection of human talk when compared to the redemptive power of what Thoreau called ""Nature's language full of poetry."" Between the Transcendentalists and Whitman there took place a fundamental disagreement over the social and political significance of self-expression. By abandoning the idea that Nature transcended human history and re-describing mass-mediated society as entirely natural, Whitman taught his readers to see circulating discourse as an enabling condition of a good life. Chapters Two and Three explore shifting understandings of the relationship of authorship to free expression through a study of James Fenimore Cooper's libel suits against Horace Greeley. Although Cooper and Greeley have both been identified as among the first professional writers in America, they had fundamentally different understandings of free speech. Greeley saw self-expression as a calling, in the fulfillment of which he turned himself into the supplier of a public sphere that he conceived on the model of the ""marketplace of ideas."" Cooper dismissed this new ethic of self-expression as an alibi for greed and demagoguery. Free speech, for Cooper, implied a responsibility on the part of citizens to speak only when doing so was politically and morally expedient. This belief led Cooper to rethink the ethical status of his own public performances as a fiction-writer. In his novels about Native Americans, Cooper fantasized about ways of speaking freely that did not hold themselves accountable to the interactional nouns of an increasingly expressivist public culture. The next two chapters demonstrate the centrality of self-expression to modern understandings of identity, distinguishing between two configurations of identity avowed in Native American public culture. Chapter Four argues that prior to the second half of the nineteenth century Native authors writing for mass audiences tended to affirm their Indian identity as a trait given to them by God or Nature. For Christian Indians like Samson Occom, William Apess, and George Copway, Indianness was an objective fact about oneself to which one bore witness in deference to a higher authority (God or, later, science) who supervised history. Chapter Five traces the gradual process through which native writers came to characterize Indian identity as the sort of attribute that could only be avowed from a first-personal point of view. Turn-of-the-century intellectuals like Zitkala-.Saˇ and Carlos Montezuma insisted that only an Indian could authoritatively express (and thereby performatively determine) what it was to be an Indian; Indianness was not something to which one could bear witness as an objective ""given."" The Society of American Indians (SAI), the first mass-mediated movement for pan-Indian solidarity, was founded in the service of this expressive understanding of Indian identity. Chapter Six recounts the late-nineteenth-century emergence of a transnational social movement that I call ""expressive enlightenment."" Reading the ethnological writings of Daniel Brinton and Franz Boas alongside the newspaper publications of the Yavapai-Apache editor Carlos Montezuma, I show how self-expression emerged a new cultural ""universal"" at a time when mass-mediated forms of belonging displaced forms of solidarity based on kinship, tribe, and race. Both Boas and Montezuma, despite the disparateness of the contexts in which they wrote, saw expressing oneself as a way of taking charge of one's own destiny, thereby announcing to the world that one had constituted oneself as a modern subject. This understanding of self-expression as an ethical practice would help motivate new ethnic uplift movements like the SAI and NAACP, as well as new scholarly disciplines like cultural anthropology and Americanist literary criticism.",1813605877,,Dissertations & Theses," Carr, RyanCarrRyanCarr, Ryan", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4156812921 , 107291992 , 66569 , 9781369064599 , 10151755 , 10151755", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369064599, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1813605877?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature,, 0591 American literature, American literature," Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Expressivism+in+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carr%2C+Ryan&amp;isbn=9781369064599&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Contingent Bodies Art in and around Los Angeles, 1969–75","In January 1971, the same year a young Chris Burden performed his landmark Shoot in Santa Ana, Robert Morris published an essay in Artforum describing the work of three “extra-visual” West Coast artists. All three, it turned out, were fictional. Their real-life prototypes, however, are clear in retrospect; several are even named in the essay. Whether a parody or a projection of Morris’ own artistic aspirations, the essay described a real artistic trend underway in California: there, artists were creating, as Morris wrote, “situations of ‘being’ rather than the implied actions of the ‘having done’ common to much ‘thing’ art that is now available.” The primary goal of this dissertation is to identify a distinctive crucible of Los Angeles-based avant-garde art in the years 1969–1975 that focused on “situations of being” rather than “things.” This area of physically-oriented artistic practice is part of—yet distinct within—the history of performance art in general. As Paul McCarthy, one its most recognized members, has noted, there is a “history of individual artists and groups of artists which in a large sense [has] gone unrecognized within the international art community…Their work was highly respected and influential in California at that time and deserves more attention now.” As Morris’ essay implies, California was a center of intense post-Minimalist practice. Minimalism, as Michael Fried famously pointed out, had brought the spectator’s body into active play by introducing phenomenological specificity to the aesthetic experience; in the late 1960’s, artists took the logical next step of locating the artwork in the body itself. In California, artists such as Burden, McCarthy, Bas Jan Ader, Allen Ruppersberg, Barbara T. Smith, and the collectives Asco and Bodacious Buggerrilla extended this further with their own radical experiments in integrating the the artist and the audience into the artwork. A fertile institutional environment further encouraged fresh and surprising artistic outcomes. The full-throttle sensibility of this scene is well-known through of its most luminary elements, like Burden, but also extended to many lesser-known participants. This dissertation discusses their work not solely in terms of typology (e.g., performance art, conceptual art), individual achievements, or emergent social movements (e.g., feminism, Chicanismo), but rather as the product of an interrelated intellectual community shaped, in part, by its specific context in southern California. This community of artists, working simultaneously across the region, generated some of the most vital artistic statements in this period of contemporary art history. The dissertation consists of four chapters examining performance work in this era in relation to its political, social, and institutional context; its immediate artistic precursors, particularly minimalism and post-minimalism; the development of diverse interactive practices; and the emergence in performance of a collaborative, communitarian approach to art-making. A final conclusion examines the later 1970s and the emergence of punk and cabaret elements in performance.",1820071346,,Dissertations & Theses," Lowery, Rebecca SkafsgaardLowerySkafsgaardRebeccaLowery, Rebecca Skafsgaard", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4184428501 , 102533392 , 66569 , 9781339950839 , 10139598 , 10139598", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339950839, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1820071346?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0377 Art history"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0377 Art history"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0377 Art history",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0377 Art history"," American studies , American history , Art history"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Art education , California , Conceptual art , Los Angeles , Performance art , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contingent+Bodies+Art+in+and+around+Los+Angeles%2C+1969%E2%80%9375&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lowery%2C+Rebecca+Skafsgaard&amp;isbn=9781339950839&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Investing in Manhood Gender, Finance Capitalism, and the Professionalization of Wall Street, 1890-1914","This dissertation is a history of New York City’s financial community—Wall Street—between 1890 and 1914. It traces the development of a community of professionals, including bankers, brokers, accountants, and attorneys, who in the wake of the economic crisis of the early 1890s learned to cooperate in new ways to consolidate manufacturing companies into industrial “trusts” and helped place New York City’s capital markets at the focal point of the American economic system. It argues that ideas about masculinity played a critical role in this process, enabling Wall Street professionals to claim social and political authority for their new power by presenting themselves as exemplars of a new corporate masculinity that was more capable of meeting the challenges of the global economy than the laissez-faire, competitive capitalism that had characterized previous decades. The first four chapters review ideas about masculinity in the context of economic growth, the development of a code of values based on cooperation among Wall Street professionals, the career trajectories of clerical workers in the Wall Street workforce, and the geographic and temporal context in which the Wall Street workday unfolded. The four following chapters explore how ideologies of gender shaped relationships within the professional community and shaped the financial sector’s reputation in American society as a whole, reviewing the role of Wall Street professionals in the “merger movement” of the early 1900s, the life insurance scandals of 1905, the financial panic of 1907 and finally debates over Wall Street’s power that culminated in the “money trust” hearings of 1912–1913 and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914.",1820934316,,Dissertations & Theses," Pertilla, Atiba KalonjiPertillaKalonjiAtibaPertilla, Atiba Kalonji", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4186925981 , 107818132 , 66569 , 9781339951287 , 10139643 , 10139643", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339951287, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1820934316?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history , 0733 Gender studies"," American history , Economic history , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Finance , Gender , Labor , Masculinity , Professionalism , Wall street",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Investing+in+Manhood+Gender%2C+Finance+Capitalism%2C+and+the+Professionalization+of+Wall+Street%2C+1890-1914&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pertilla%2C+Atiba+Kalonji&amp;isbn=9781339951287&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Politics, state power, &amp;amp; policies: Exploring the contemporary nature of economic governance through the case of Brazil","Uneven development continues apace, yet it is constantly challenged by groups, cities, states, and countries around the world. Latin America has been a particularly fertile region of experimentation in this regard since the early 2000s, when the region witnessed the election of a wave of leftist leaders. Discussions about the emergence of a post-neoliberalism have been central to political debate in the region for decades now, and new, sometimes radical, models for development and government are being implemented across the region. In Brazil these experimentations have taken a more traditional form, invoking the past successes of a powerful state in directing economic development, but also updating these old authoritarian models to reflect the new context of a vibrant democracy. Differently from earlier eras, when nationalist or developmentalist models were tolerated, or even encouraged, the present is marked by the dominance of singular, though not homogeneous, model of neoliberal capitalism which deters and obstructs alternate forms of development across multiple scales and geographies. This dissertation centers on the question of the politics and practice of economic governance in the contemporary era and the possibility for alternate models. This question is grounded through an analysis of the case of Brazil. During nine months of field research in Brazil between 2012–2013, key actors from the public and private sector involved in industrial policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring were interviewed. Data was also collected at the first National Conference on Regional Development (2013) in Brasilia, the Forum for Development in the Northeast (2013) and the Regional Economics Conference (2013), both in Fortaleza, and informally during the Free Fare Movement protests of June and July 2013 in São Paulo, and the ‘Day of Labor Struggles’ march jointly organized by the major national labor unions in São Paulo on July 11, 2013. The data from these in-depth, semi-structured interviews, and less formal street-level interviews, was then triangulated through extensive research among secondary materials, government policy documents, and media coverage to provide adequate depth and breadth to accurately debate this admittedly wide-ranging and very complex topic. By examining these processes at the three distinct levels of policies, state power, and politics, an integrative and comprehensive analysis is provided to explain the possibilities and challenges of pursuing alternative development models in the present era. This dissertation, organized as a collection of three articles, begins with an analysis of the policy outcomes of Brazil’s new developmentalist orientation and highlights the strategic role that states can and do play in shaping the formation and evolution of global production networks. The second article works to expand and operationalize the variegated capitalism approach, and interrogates the constitutive social forms of economic institutionalization and their relation to international regimes in order to discern key forces and limitations to capitalist variegation—in the case of Brazil, variegation was possible up to the point that the government began to restructure the profits and operation of the financial sector. The third article moves to the level of politics in order to explore how political identities are constructed and mobilized in support of particular place-based projects through the use of populist logics in pursuit of hegemony, and reveals how a leader’s understanding of politics can have drastic impacts on his or her success—in the case of Brazil, President Lula was enormously successful in this regard, while his successor President Dilma was far less successful. Through this dissertation, I demonstrate that understanding the contemporary production of uneven development and economic governance requires an approach that links the concrete policies back to their origins in state projects and visions, and then link these visions and projects back to the underlying political-economic imaginaries that serve to orient them. As a result, societal buy-in to the guiding political economic imaginaries becomes key if the state projects and individual policies are to be successful. Constructing this buy-in is a political process of identity construction, and cannot be understood as a simple linking of defined class positions and interests, but requires a contemporary understanding of how political identities are constructed in order to be successful.",1824051556,,Dissertations & Theses," Sphar, Jefferson AlexSpharAlexJeffersonSphar, Jefferson Alex", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4197143721 , 101597632 , 66569 , 9781339982625 , 10143008 , 10143008", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339982625, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824051556?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0511 Economic theory , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0511 Economic theory , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0511 Economic theory , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0366 Geography , 0511 Economic theory , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Geography , Economic theory , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Brazil , Global production networks , Latin America , Political economy , Political theory , State theory",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Politics%2C+state+power%2C+%26amp%3B+policies%3A+Exploring+the+contemporary+nature+of+economic+governance+through+the+case+of+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sphar%2C+Jefferson+Alex&amp;isbn=9781339982625&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Religious Tension in Brazil: The Rise of Militant Pentecostalism and Implications for Afro-Brazilian Religions,"The size, power, and representation of the Pentecostal movement are rapidly increasing around the world, particularly in the Global South. This is especially the case in Brazil, where conversions from Catholicism and other religions to Pentecostalism have huge implications for religious tolerance and even race relations. Vulnerable minority Afro-Brazilian religions are increasingly targeted by evangelical Christians, particularly by Pentecostals and neo-Pentecostals, creating a tense situation between the two groups. Militant groups of Pentecostals have carried out violence against Afro-Brazilian temples and practitioners on the ground, as well as hate speech on the internet and other spaces in the public sphere. Brazilians and others commenting on the situation assert that Pentecostals target these religions for reasons of competition, and though I do not contest this, I expand on this discussion by examining moral disagreements between the two groups as well as the role of race and racism. In order to investigate some Pentecostal methods for the spread of hate speech and violence, I traveled to Rio de Janeiro. I chose the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a huge and controversial neo-Pentecostal church network, as a case study. The UCKG is one of the biggest perpetrators of intolerance against the Afro-Brazilian minority religions. I attended numerous UCKG church services in various neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro as an observer and a participant. My findings were that the Church promotes a language of war and gives a moral justification for worshippers’ battles with nonbelievers, and that it has elements of militancy in its proselytism. It also poses itself as the victim, asserting that it is discriminated against (for spreading hate) and demanding that its intolerance be tolerated. In order to further investigate the motivations behind these behaviors and attitudes, I have utilized media coverage, social media, and academic sources. I have found that the UCKG is highly competitive for territory and that it additionally denounces Afro-Brazilian religions for moral reasons. But furthermore, even though Pentecostals and especially the UCKG are racially diverse, I assert that their attacks on Afro-Brazilian religions have racist undertones. Examples from Africa where the UCKG demonizes African traditions and employs racialized depictions of African peoples shed light on this conversation. Overall, this thesis is a conversation about the increasing use of the public sphere on the part of evangelicals, and especially militant groups of Pentecostals and neo-Pentecostals, to spread hate against Afro-Brazilian minority religions. These behaviors reflect larger trends of increasing religious fervor in the public sphere around the globe, which undermines tolerance and secularity, and in this situation, racial equality. The breadth and popularity of this movement in Brazil and globally necessarily makes an understanding of these issues crucial to efforts to promote religious and even racial tolerance and equality in Brazil and elsewhere.",1825331649,,Dissertations & Theses," Neace, Sarah RachelleNeaceRachelleSarahNeace, Sarah Rachelle", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4202467241 , 104652802 , 66569 , 9781369147537 , 10159825 , 10159825", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369147537, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1825331649?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion,, 0318 Religion, Religion," Philosophy, religion and theology , Afro-brazilian religions , Candomblé , Pentecostalism , Racism , Religious intolerance , Universal church of the kingdom of god",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Religious+Tension+in+Brazil%3A+The+Rise+of+Militant+Pentecostalism+and+Implications+for+Afro-Brazilian+Religions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Neace%2C+Sarah+Rachelle&amp;isbn=9781369147537&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Legal pluralism in the constitution of bolivia of 2009: between multiculturalism and plurinationalism,"This thesis examines the role of human rights discourse in a decolonisation project. It focuses on ‘legal pluralism’, which in Bolivia refers to the constitutional recognition of indigenous legal orders, in the Constitution of Bolivia of 2009. This Constitution was the result of a cycle of social protests in Bolivia between 2000-2005 against neoliberalism, imperialism and colonialism headed by indigenous and peasant organisations that culminated in a Constituent Assembly Process (2006-2009). The thesis takes an transdisciplinary approach in order to define the concepts of legal pluralism, decolonization and indigenous autonomy in the Constitution, as well as to understand the way indigenous movements, the state and other political actors deploy the discourse of indigenous collective rights. The theoretical approach to indigenous rights is also transdisciplinary and focused on the problematization of the notions of culture, indigenous subject and indigenous law in international human rights law and in Bolivia’s current legal framework. The main findings of the research are that the Constitution adopts two competing paradigms in relation to the regulation of state-indigenous relations in general and legal pluralism in specific: a human rights approach and plurinationalism. However, because of the political context of the Constituent Assembly, the predominant approach in the Constitution is the human rights approach. The main argument of the thesis is that the this approach is in tension with plurinationalism because of the predominance in international human rights law of a reifying perspective of indigenous legal orders and cultures and a primitivist conception of indigeneity. The human rights approach therefore limits radical proposals such as the equal hierarchy of state law and indigenous legal orders, as proposed in the context of plurinationalism. In addition, because of its use of a cultural difference paradigm, currently the human rights approach, particularly in the context of judicial cases, depoliticises race and conflicts related to indigenous peoples by dissociating them from existing political and economic structures. Indigenous collective rights in this context become a (neoliberal) form of governmentality that contributes to the legitimation of these structures and the formation of a ‘permitted’ indigenous subject.",1827578265,,Dissertations & Theses," Barrantes-Reynolds, María-PaulaBarrantes-ReynoldsMaría-PaulaBarrantes-Reynolds, María-Paula", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209637911 , 103854232 , 101309 , 10177087 , 10177087 , http://hdl.handle.net/2381/37599", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827578265?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/2381/37599 , (UMI)AAI10177087 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Legal+pluralism+in+the+constitution+of+bolivia+of+2009%3A+between+multiculturalism+and+plurinationalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Barrantes-Reynolds%2C+Mari%CC%81a-Paula&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The role of art and artists in contesting gentrification in london and new york city,"Gentrification, the contentious terrain where neo-liberalism meets housing, has been widely explored in urban geography, with few under researched areas remaining. This thesis fills one such gap by focusing on artists - a group who have been historically noted to contribute at all stages of gentrification, from triggering it to ultimately being displaced themselves. With increased consciousness of the process opening up their role in a new direction, artists are also more recently engaging in fervent activism and resistance in trying to control the aggressive spread of gentrification. This study concentrates on artists in situ in two cities with widespread gentrification, the international art hubs: London and New York City. The artists interviewed for this study have been resisting gentrification in non-violent ways, using their art to protest. Complementing in-depth interviews and a critique of art works, analysis is carried out to seek how and why artists are motivated to resist and how they reconcile themselves with the contradictions over their roles in gentrification. This thesis demonstrates the existence of new trajectories for the roles of artists in gentrification, particularly in terms of efforts of stalling, or finding an alternative for the process. Overall, artists are aware of what they represent in the gentrification process and are motivated to mitigate any adverse effects of this. On a broader scale, the study uncovers an incubating social movement: grassroots activism which finds itself colliding head-on with the top-down paradigm of economic value creation over social equality. Although the various individual actors in this struggle are not always connected or even aware of each other; some are organising themselves to fight the tide of gentrification, learning and sharing valuable lessons along the way, which have the potential to be useful to those positioning themselves against gentrification.",1827601743,,Dissertations & Theses," Vona, ViktoriaVonaViktoriaVona, Viktoria", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209794271 , 103780982 , 101309 , 10177526 , 10177526 , http://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-role-of-art-and-artists-in-contesting-gentrification-in-london-and-new-york-city(b7db0c51-6276-4094-8bce-77a72bab0c92).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827601743?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-role-of-art-and-artists-in-contesting-gentrification-in-london-and-new-york-city(b7db0c51-6276-4094-8bce-77a72bab0c92).html , (UMI)AAI10177526 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+art+and+artists+in+contesting+gentrification+in+london+and+new+york+city&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vona%2C+Viktoria&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Youth cultures in the mixed economy of welfare: youth clubs and voluntary associations in south london and liverpool 1958-1985,"Young people in post-war Britain have grown up in a context of fast-paced change and constant attention; from transformation in state welfare in the 1940s and 1950s, concern about delinquent and subcultural youth in the 1960s and 1970s, and the consequences of recession and youth unemployment in the 1980s. Youth clubs at this time provided a space where young people could figure out myriad influences on their lives and emerging identities. To date, these significant organisations have been woefully under-examined by historians who have largely failed to look at youth groups except in uniformed or religious contexts, or as part of the solution to youth crime. Much practitioner research remains ahistorical in its approach. Early histories of youth movements such as John Springhall’s are being built upon by exciting new interdisciplinary research, for example by Sarah Mills. This thesis contributes to this emerging body of work and restores the place of the youth club in our understandings of youth in the post-war period. This research set out to establish the full range of roles that youth clubs and their membership associations had in the post-war period and how they linked with other forms of voluntarism, welfare and youth provision. Additionally, this research wanted to look at how youth clubs fitted into the lives of young people at a time when their leisure and cultural pursuits were the subject of much scrutiny. In uncovering the complexity and distinctiveness of youth voluntary organisations, local case studies are essential. They allow this research to demonstrate the local factors at work in shaping young lives and youth cultures and provide much-needed evidence about how voluntary service-providing organisations have contributed to the history of voluntarism and welfare in contemporary British history. Papers of clubs and associations held privately and in archives have been complemented by oral history interviews and a range of other sources to examine fully the voluntary youth club in South London and Liverpool. These sources show that clubs were shaped by unique mixes of geography, welfare politics, social issues, international influences, and young people themselves to create spaces for fluid youth cultures and clubs which could blend roles and relationships in order to adapt to local needs and experiences. Youth voluntary organisations were central to networks of youth welfare in London and Liverpool. By looking at how these organisations operated and their relationship with the state, this thesis establishes that voluntary youth clubs were on the frontier of the mixed economy of welfare. They were dynamic in the face of social change and effective in accommodating and responding to the cultural needs of the young consumer in the post-war period. The evidence presented here shows that youth clubs and associations had a pivotal role in helping young people navigate myriad problems. Furthermore, this thesis argues that the category ‘youth’ has concealed the way in which a wide variety of factors such as class, gender, race, and locality have shaped the experiences of young people. Finally, this thesis reveals the crucial role played by a new generation of youth workers, who challenged traditions rooted in uniformed organisations and older youth movements, in embedding permissive and radical approaches in to youth clubs. Ultimately, this thesis argues that the unfixed and contested identity of the youth club could react, respond and adapt to changing welfare, social and cultural pressures. This has given them an undefinable but central status on the very borders of local mixed economies of welfare in South London and Liverpool where the state, voluntary, consumer and cultural were all interconnected to create not only uniquely situated organisations but also micro-local youth cultures. The research presented here contributes to debates about civil society and the making of citizens. It aids understanding of how the category of youth has been constructed and used in wider society in the post-war period. It also adds to our understanding of what welfare provision has looked like and the boundaries between different types of provision. This in turn informs contemporary discussion of who should provide youth and wider welfare services and what forms this should take.",1827601916,,Dissertations & Theses," Clements, CharlotteClementsCharlotteClements, Charlotte", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209794621 , 103854282 , 101309 , 10177537 , 10177537 , http://kar.kent.ac.uk/54856/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827601916?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://kar.kent.ac.uk/54856/ , (UMI)AAI10177537 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Youth+cultures+in+the+mixed+economy+of+welfare%3A+youth+clubs+and+voluntary+associations+in+south+london+and+liverpool+1958-1985&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clements%2C+Charlotte&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The young generation of Chinese artists and their ambitions,"In the 21st-century, Chinese contemporary art and artists have seen constant innovation and competition on a global level. The rise of a group of young artists marked the new era of the Chinese contemporary art. Their challenge has a positive impact on China's future artists. This thesis will explore three artists, Jin Shan, Sun Xun and Hu Xiaoyuan, who were among the 25 featured in the exhibition, “My Generation: Young Chinese Artists” held at the Orange County Museum of Art (OCMA) in 2015. This exhibition was originally curated by Barbara Pollack at the Tampa Museum of Art in 2014. Their aggressive works represent the struggle and transformation that Chinese youth have undertaken to reverse many traditional ideas of art held for generations by this ancient culture. Changes in Chinese society have shifted the social values, the public has begun to be interested in the art market, and overtly political art began to be phased out by the Young Generation of Chinese. Young Chinese artists have had increasing chances to learn about and even train in Western art. American contemporary art has had a particularly strong influence on those young artists. Their philosophy is rooted in Chinese culture, but their thinking has absorbed the Western art movements. Through many artworks, several of which are discussed in this thesis, the Young Generation of Chinese artists are attempting to establish a new Chinese art style which will affect the future of the Chinese art market and can be considered to be a positive influence.",1827718144,,Dissertations & Theses," Tang, YuyangTangYuyangTang, Yuyang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4210762981 , 106170492 , 66569 , 9781369008975 , 10145365 , 10145365", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369008975, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827718144?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0377 Art history"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0377 Art history"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0377 Art history",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0377 Art history"," Asian American Studies , Art history"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Chinese contemporary art , Shan, Jin , Xiaoyuan, Hu , Xun, Sun",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+young+generation+of+Chinese+artists+and+their+ambitions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tang%2C+Yuyang&amp;isbn=9781369008975&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Terrestrial Things War, Language and Value in Afghanistan","This dissertation is an ethnographic engagement with the social and political space of Afghanistan and how it has been shaped by the intensities of warfare in the last decade, with a focus on the realms of language, representation and economy. Taking Kabul as the panoramic ground of profound social and epistemological transformations, the dissertation traces a crucial shift beginning in 2011-2012, from a highly speculative war economy (a “green zone economy” that privileged the commodification of language and culture and the privatization of war, with crisis as an alibi for governmentality) to one based on equally speculative practices of prospecting for natural resources in the Afghan underground: where an estimated three trillion dollars’ worth of copper, gold, iron-ore, marble and oil &amp; gas is presumed to lie in wait. I illustrate the nuanced epistemological concerns and political contestations that stem from an Afghan effort to distinguish between sources of violence and sources of economic value (especially in the aftermath of Kabul’s demilitarization) in a milieu where foreign militaries presuppose that civilians and insurgents cannot be distinguished, except through the medium of war-time translation and collaboration. The twin concern with generalized forms of death dealing and tragedy, on one hand, and the moral and political exigency for Afghans to distinguish between a world of appearances and one of essences (the Islamic and Quranic interpretation of zahir (exterior/surface) and batin (interior/ground), on the other, opens onto a set of epistemological concerns undergirded by several oppositions, which I argue, are central to American war making. I illustrate that the movement between these artificial binaries (Persian/Pashto and English, literacy and illiteracy, rationality and irrationality, repetition and transformation) inspires aspirational fantasy on an economic frontier and invests some Afghans (especially those who speak English and are literate) with the power of calculative reason (aql) and understanding (fahm and dânish), while condemning those who are illiterate (and sometimes those who only speak Persian and/or Pashto) to forms physical supplementarity and crisis--from literally being expendable prosthetic bodies (human body armor) to the breakdown of meaning in incestuous relations and the intensification of moral crisis. In this context, conventional writing and the felt lack of its absence illustrate for us the logic of war in more consequential ways. The belief that writing is the domain of what can be known (rationally understood) and universally applied invigorates the ideology of literate persons and war-time collaborators with shocking breadth and tenacity. It organizes antagonisms between persons and structures forms of death-dealing. I trace how the production of a binary around literacy and illiteracy produces, even in moments of technological acquisition, the retrospective fantasy that orality is not only the prior but also the locus of unfettered subversion and ignorance of the law. This misrecognition of linguistic diversity as lack comes to inform, in contexts of unprecedented transnational war-time activity, the charge that Afghans are beholden to an excessive localism that fuels the predicaments of the Afghan State and errors of judgement (such as incestuous transgressions, and suicide bombing) which would destroy society altogether. The issue of vulnerability to ideological suasion and excess emerges alongside these presuppositions. It informs the belief that the incapacity to exercise reason (due to illiteracy) renders Afghans vulnerable to diverse forms of propaganda and the inability to distinguish between the world of appearances (both technological media images and the Islamic notion of the zahir (surface manifestation)) and reality. I trace these complexities through a series of intense contact points where these oppositions come into play and determine forms of access and violence 1) in translational contexts during combat missions where linguistic transformation results in deadly misunderstanding 2) in familial contexts and contestations over property, where the failure of interpersonal and extrajudicial mediation results in mass murder 3) in courtrooms where failed suicide bombers (who did not detonate out of technological error or because they were attacked by members of the Afghan National Police) are subject to the limitations of oral testimony and to the belief that photographic evidence proves that they will repeat their crimes if released from prison 4) instances of incest that arise out of illiteracy and, when exposed, generate moral crisis 5) the production of zones of exteriority and interiority (especially in Kabul’s Green Zone) that rely on phamakological inclusion and reproduce the literal supplementarity of Afghan bodies 6) the attempt to find the “real” sources of economic value as part of a multi-national gold and mineral extraction endeavor—the continuation of an obsession with the Afghan ground that has a long imperial history from the 1800’s onwards (when it was assessed through botanical, railway and coal prospecting missions). Together, these sites and the consideration of the earthen terrain alongside the terrain of rationality and linguistic difference situate us in the midst of wartime catastrophe. They foreground the fantasy that rationalism is the sine qua non of modernism, and the belief that literacy is the basis for reflective and intellectual thought, and for being human. But what they also disclose for us is that in its absence you can (and sometimes must) die.

I argue that a variety of folkloric representations of Polish cultures--including stylized folk ballets and non-stylized revivals of music and dance traditions--have functioned as vehicles for individuals and groups to imagine and performatively enact their own social, political, and economic attainment of modern identity. To highlight the transformations in the ways concepts of traditional and modern identities have been embodied in performance, this study presents an archeology of Polish modernity projects read through the lens of folkloric performance. I specifically consider these achievements in relation to partition-era national independence movements, communist-era upward socio-economic mobility, and post-communist neoliberal practices of subjectification. Based on a performance theory and discourse analysis of historical and ethnographic data, I maintain that folkloric performance has the potential to act as a diagnostic of power, revealing the changing nationalist, communist, and capitalist priorities of dynamic modernity projects. Furthermore, I argue that the simultaneous circulation of multiple folkloric performances of Polish identity is symptomatic of the palimpsestic modernity projects and definitions of national identity that have accumulated over the years. By examining two communities of Polish folklore enthusiasts, their divergent performance practices, and the larger socio-political fields in which they operate, I problematized the discursive construction and public performance of what it means to be a “modern Pole,” illustrating that, like any national or modern identity, Polishness can never be defined as just one thing. The performance and ideological differences between the two communities encapsulate larger questions that have troubled Polish society since the end of Communism: How should Soviet cultural policies be treated in the post-socialist period and why should Poles promote a unique cultural identity in the global marketplace? The answers to these questions illustrate how folk song and dance activities function as site for the performative production of multiple, modern Polish identities.",1835853380,,Dissertations & Theses," Young, Michael A.YoungA.MichaelYoung, Michael A.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4238139141 , 103527632 , 66569 , 9781369083378 , 10153199 , 10153199", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369083378, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835853380?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Music , East European Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Ethnochoreology , Ethnomusicology , Folklore , National identity , Performance studies , Poland , Polish folklore",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+city+life+of+Polish+village+culture%3A+Tradition%2C+modernity+projects%2C+and+subjectivities+in+transition&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Young%2C+Michael+A.&amp;isbn=9781369083378&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A critical analysis of culture-led urban regeneration policy in taipei and beyond,"This thesis critically and empirically investigates Taipei city’s creative and culture-led urban regeneration policies (CCURP) in recent decades to better understand how creative culture-led urban regeneration policies are generated and fixed into the city’s local context. This research challenges and complements the existing research on CCURP, policy movements (policy mobilities), and gentrification and adds empirical richness to a body of work which is generally overly theoretical, focused on a small lexicon of places and in most cases lacking in in-depth and systematic empirical examination of the causalities (among policy interventions, social impacts, and influential factors) in diverse contexts and in places ‘off the map’. A qualitative approach is adopted with an intensive case study of one CCUR policy, the Urban Regeneration Station scheme focusing on Dihua Street but also covering other areas in the city. Based on empirical data derived from in-depth interviews, analysis of documents, and observation, this thesis reveals that local complex, dynamic and yet intertwined issues of political and economic change, active civil society and global knowledge flow explain the emergence of this and other CCURP in Taipei. In concrete, this work addresses the issues of CCURP from three observation points to shed light on their move from elsewhere in the world to Taipei, the factors shaping them in the local context and their social impact on a local community. Firstly, it focuses on policy mobilities closely examining paths, learning schemes and intermediaries. It argues that the city’s CCURP are highly associated with global knowledge flows and that local planning elites are key actors in knowledge filtering and policy making, thus resulting in an incomplete and uneven learning process. Secondly, through an analysis of from policy objectives, processes, categories and policy discourse, it argues that the URS scheme is a highly localised and contested CCUR policy hiding a less precise and more haphazard executive process. Finally, it argues that CCURP have dominated the city’s redevelopment direction combining with commercial and aesthetic forces to produce a mixed type of state-led commercial aesthetic gentrification.",1837033057,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Hui-FangLiuHui-FangLiu, Hui-Fang", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4242264361 , 106702862 , 101309 , 10293708 , 10293708 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13673/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837033057?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13673/ , (UMI)AAI10293708 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+critical+analysis+of+culture-led+urban+regeneration+policy+in+taipei+and+beyond&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Hui-Fang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Dams, displacement and development in narratives of the nubian awakening","Entitled ‘Dams, Displacement and Development in Narratives of the Nubian Awakening’, this thesis is explicitly interdisciplinary and straddles the fields of literary, postcolonial, and critical development studies.

It examines how contemporary Egyptian Nubian fiction written between 1968 and the present day, particularly that associated with the revivalist movement known as the ‘Nubian Awakening’, has responded to, and represented, the legacy of dam-building on the Nile over the course of the twentieth century on Nubian culture and society. Speaking through the silences within hegemonic development discourses that celebrate large dams as symbols of economic, scientific and social progress while glossing over their local costs, I argue that the fiction of Muhammad Khalil Qasim, Yahya Mukhtar, Haggag Hassan Oddoul and Idris ‘Ali rewrites the postcolonial history of the Aswan High Dam from a subaltern perspective and constitutes a form of transnational cultural advocacy for Nubian rights. Moreover, by highlighting Egypt’s African identity, Nubian literature challenges hegemonic understandings of Egyptian national culture as Arab, thereby creating a more democratic space in which marginalised minority groups can claim a place for their subjectivities, political aspirations and cultural practices within the national imaginary.",1837033466,,Dissertations & Theses," Gilmore, Christine AnnaGilmoreAnnaChristineGilmore, Christine Anna", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4242264451 , 106702862 , 101309 , 10293932 , 10293932 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13075/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837033466?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13075/ , (UMI)AAI10293932 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dams%2C+displacement+and+development+in+narratives+of+the+nubian+awakening&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gilmore%2C+Christine+Anna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Landscapes of alterity: climate change in contemporary bolivia,"This thesis considers perceptions of climate change in contemporary Bolivia. It commences with a view of a small highland community, Kaata, and expands outwards, tracing the networks of migration that connect this village to the city, and looking at how climate change discourse changes as we scale up to the national and international level. Climate change is considered in Kaata to constitute an ontological shift from the networks of reciprocity which until recently comprised a whole landscape, holding community members to one another as well as to neighbouring villages and telluric landscape spirits. Young people now increasingly desire city made commodities, engaging in capitalist relations which lead them away from this landscape. Climate change thus charts a weakening of the community, of people, their fields and rituals. While a modernist perspective is inclined to separate the weather, as ‘nature’, from ‘culture’ or human actions, Kaateños consider all these conversant animate elements of a system. I take this emic definition of climate change as the basis of this thesis. We continue, following the human element of this landscape, the young people, in the networks that draw them into the city, analysing the desires by which they are led there. Crucially, these are shaped by mimesis, emulating the city/western other through changing dress and dancing styles. I show how these dynamics of alterity are deeply rooted, resembling classic structuralist analyses of Andean culture based in the ethnic interplay of self and other. In Chapter Three I look at efforts to reform Bolivia’s agricultural system through implementing Food Sovereignty (FS). The social movements representing Kaata hope this would connect such villages into national markets and thus motivate young people to remain there through integrating the village into cash economies. I explore how such measures become influenced by a city-based discourse of an ideal rural ‘other’, which is inadequate to the contemporary reality of villages like Kaata, and limits their efficacy, even where young people desire return migration. The FS discourse is similarly influenced by a search for an ideal ‘other’ removed from capitalism. In Chapter Four I assess President Evo Morales’ claim to be effecting a pachakuti, a shift in the ontological bases of the nation, equal and counterposed to the Spanish conquest. Kaata challenges Morales’ assertion of a pachakuti of Andean against colonial values, as it considers that it is shifting to become more ‘white’. Indian actors are nationally rising within a landscape determined by international capital, revealing Morales’ pachakuti to be human-centred. Rather than transforming existing landscapes to make them more indigenous, this is a pachakuti or ontological shift to the landscape of the western ‘other’, entailing the ‘death’ of the highlands and tradition. The Tipnis crisis presents challenges Morales on the national stage. I conclude that while the animist landscapes Kaata evokes can help moderns conceptualise climate change, it does not provide the solution sought after from animist indigenous peoples at an international level. While they are fetishized as ‘the people outside capitalism’, human agency is but a small factor in an animist landscape, and humans have not the agency to combat climate change.",1837035196,,Dissertations & Theses," Bold, Rosalyn AnnBoldAnnRosalynBold, Rosalyn Ann", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4242267661 , 103890562 , 101309 , 10292503 , 10292503 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:299278", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837035196?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:299278 , (UMI)AAI10292503 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Landscapes+of+alterity%3A+climate+change+in+contemporary+bolivia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bold%2C+Rosalyn+Ann&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The space of Japanese science fiction: Illustration, subculture, and the body in ""SF Magazine""","This is a study of the rise of science fiction as a subculture in the 1960s through an analysis of the first and longest-running commercial science fiction magazine in Japan: SF Magazine. Much of the research on science fiction in Japan focuses on the boom in the 1980s or on the very first science fictional texts created in the early years of the twentieth century, glossing over this pivotal decade. From 1959-1969, SF Magazine ’s covers created a visual legacy of the relationship of the human body to space that reveals larger concerns about technology, science, and humanity. This legacy centers around the mediation of human existence through technology (called the posthuman), which also transforms our understanding of gender and space in contemporary works. I examine the constellation of Japanese conceptions of the body in science fiction, its manifestations and limits, exploring how the representation of this Japanese, posthuman, and often cyborgian body is figured as an absence in the space of science fiction landscapes. SF Magazine was used by consumers to construct meanings of self, social identity, and social relations. Science fiction illustration complemented and supported the centrality of SF Magazine, making these illustrations integral to the production the of science fiction subculture and to the place of the body within Japanese science fiction. Their representation of space, and then in the later part of the 1960s the return of the body to these covers, mirrors the theoretical and emotional concerns of not just science fiction writers and readers in the 1960s, but the larger social and historical concerns present in the country at large. The horrifying and painful mutability of bodies that came to light after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki manifests, in the latter years of the 1960s in science fiction, as the fantastically powerful mutating bodies of super heroes and cyborgs within the science fictional world. The bombed spaces of the postwar (largely ignored in mainstream 1960s media) were reimagined in productive ways on the covers of SF Magazine, mirroring the fiction and nonfictional contents. It is through this publication that a recognizable community emerges, a particular type of identity becomes associated with the science fiction fan that coalesced when the magazine began to offer different points of articulation, both through the covers and through the magazine’s contents. That notion of the science fiction fan as a particular subjectivity, as a particular way to navigate the world, created a space to articulate trauma and to investigate ways out of that trauma not available in mainstream works. My work seeks to build on literary scholarship that considers the role commercial and pulp genres fiction play in negotiating and constructing community. I contribute to recent scholarship in art history that investigates the close relationship of Surrealism to mass culture movements in postwar Japan, although these art historians largely center their work on advertising in the pre-war context. Furthermore, my project reconsiders the importance of the visual to a definition of science fiction: it is only when the visual and textual are blended that a recognizable version of science fiction emerges – in the same way the magazine featuring the work of fans blurred the boundary between professional and fan. Hence, although the context of my study is 1960s Japan, my research is inseparable from larger investigations of the visual and the textual, the global understanding of science fiction, the relationship between high art and commercial culture, and contemporary media studies. This work is therefore of interest not only to literary science fiction scholars, but also to researchers in critical theory, visual studies, fan studies, and contemporary Japanese culture.",1841909947,,Dissertations & Theses," Page-Lippsmeyer, KathrynPage-LippsmeyerKathrynPage-Lippsmeyer, Kathryn", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4257032061 , 109184342 , 66569 , 9781369150728 , 10160154 , 10160154", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369150728, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1841909947?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies"," Comparative literature , Asian literature , Asian Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Illustration , Japan , Magazines , Pulp , Science fiction",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+space+of+Japanese+science+fiction%3A+Illustration%2C+subculture%2C+and+the+body+in+%22SF+Magazine%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Page-Lippsmeyer%2C+Kathryn&amp;isbn=9781369150728&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Whose city? Intersections of gender, class, and (il)legitimate belonging in Delhi's Jhuggi Jhopris","In the constantly transforming space of India’s capital, belonging and rights to the city are continually contested at intersections of class and gender. Following India’s economic “liberalization” in the early 1990s, there has been a growing push among the country’s business and elite classes to transform big cities such as Delhi and Mumbai into “global cities,” complete with high-rise buildings, multiplexes, and massive highways. This trend has reinvigorated already embedded popular discourses and government policies that characterize the makeshift and unauthorized housing structures of the urban poor as problems to be solved, primarily through their demolition and the removal of their residents to peripheries of the city. This is in stark contrast to many lavish elite neighborhoods, also built illegally and utilizing public resources, which do not face similar concerns of demolition and removal. Instead, spatial precariousness remains largely a dilemma of the poor. Simultaneously, scholars have noted that the “outside” or “public” of Indian cities remain spaces to be consumed and enjoyed by distinctly masculine bodies (Hansen 2001; Lukose 2009). In contrast, women in urban public spaces must often move in primarily circumscribed ways. What’s more, Delhi has had a growing reputation as a city that is particularly unsafe for women and is popularly referred to as India’s “rape capital.” Indeed, following a widely publicized gang rape in 2012, there has been an increasing emphasis placed on women’s safety, and more generally on “women’s empowerment,” by city residents, social activists, and politicians alike. Yet, public discourses of women’s empowerment tend to rely heavily on narratives and experiences of middle-class women, failing to address the experiences and ongoing struggles of poor women living in slums. Meanwhile, slum resident women must constantly negotiate their rights to both public and private spaces of the city as they balance movement between the instability of their “illegal” homes and the “masculine” public spaces. This dissertation aims to examine the intersectional marginalization (Crenshaw 1991) of poor women in Delhi as they navigate an urban space that is hostile to both female and impoverished persons but seldom provides modes of organized resistance that holistically or effectively incorporate both of these identities.",1848290027,,Dissertations & Theses," Glegziabher, Meskerem ZikruGlegziabherZikruMeskeremGlegziabher, Meskerem Zikru", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4276917121 , 104497992 , 66569 , 9781369425239 , 10247819 , 10247819", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369425239, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1848290027?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Cultural anthropology , South Asian Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Access to basic resources , Access to housing , Gender and urban space , Intersectionality , Rights to the city",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Whose+city%3F+Intersections+of+gender%2C+class%2C+and+%28il%29legitimate+belonging+in+Delhi%27s+Jhuggi+Jhopris&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Glegziabher%2C+Meskerem+Zikru&amp;isbn=9781369425239&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conversion and ritualisation: an analysis of how westerners enter the international society for krishna consciousness and assimilate its values and practices,"The central aim of my thesis is to examine the processes by which individuals from a Western background enter the International Society for Krishna Consciousnes (ISKCON), a transnational religious movement with its roots in Chaitanya Vaishnavism, a Hindu tradition originating in India. The central argument of my research is that extant models of conversion do not do justice to the process by which individuals enter ISKCON and assimilate its values, beliefs, and practices. This thesis thus critically examines conversion models/theories and seeks to refine our understanding of conversion, especially in relation to groups in which everyday ritual practice plays a central role. My research is based on the analysis of in-depth interviews with ISKCON entrants and engagement with theories on ritual and literature on conversion. The tradition’s essential practices involve chanting God’s holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare and making food offerings to the Hindu deity Krishna (these are referred to as prasadam rites). Ritual is both a doorway for coming in contact with ISKCON and a crucial practice for entrants to make progress from the status of neophyte to novice and to qualify for successive initiation rituals. I draw mainly upon Catherine Bell’s theory of ritualisation to explore entry into ISKCON in relation to ritual practices. Ritualisation, in the ISKCON context, is a strategy that facilitates the internalisation of ISKCON’s central values and worldviews. This is made possible through the entrant’s initial exposure to its rituals, his/her search for the meaning behind these rituals, gradual acceptance of ISKCON’s 5 schemes of ritualisation, and, over the long-term, acquisition of ritual mastery. From a sociological perspective, entry into ISKCON is a three-staged process involving separation, transition, and incorporation. The stage of separation is a phase of accepting sets of oppositions concerned with polarities of purity and pollution, causing alienation from previous social circles and encouraging group-integration within ISKCON. The transitional stage is characterized by the internalisation of beliefs, worldviews and values. The stage of incorporation is marked by successive stages of seekership (searching for, and finding, meaning using ISKCON frameworks) and commitment (not just to ISKCON’s values and ritual practices, but also to its missionary agenda). To determine how ritual practice constructs power relationships and creates boundaries for the development of active agency and passivity, I look at four dimensions of ritualisation. These are (following Bell): (1) the effects of ritual practice on socialisation and vice versa; (2) the role of ritual specialists; (3) the forms of misrecognition and blindness resulting from ritual practice; and (4) the influence of ritualisation on the agency of entrants. My work demonstrates that “conversion” in the ISKCON context is marked by three crucial features. First, it is a process of gradual “drifting” into ISKCON’s fold, not a sudden change. Second, conversion to ISKCON’s belief system is facilitated by the adoption of the ritual practices central to ISKCON. Hence belief and practice are closely intertwined in the conversion process, with ritual practice serving, in most cases, as the entry point. And finally, my work demonstrates that this “conversion” does not entail a radical break with previously held religious beliefs and values. Instead, “converts” to ISKCON continue to profess their former faith, but now filter this through the lens of ISKCON’s Vaishnava devotionalism.",1857775608,,Dissertations & Theses," Backer, Luc deBackerdeLucBacker, Luc de", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4299224481 , 110135112 , 101309 , 10303543 , 10303543 , http://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/654/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1857775608?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/654/ , (UMI)AAI10303543 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conversion+and+ritualisation%3A+an+analysis+of+how+westerners+enter+the+international+society+for+krishna+consciousness+and+assimilate+its+values+and+practices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Backer%2C+Luc+de&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The impact of religiously motivated boycotts on brand loyalty among transnational consumers,"Boycotting has been empirically proven to be damaging to business organisations, and there is compelling evidence to suggest that it is not only here to stay, but it is also on the increase. Brand loyalty is declining for many reasons including the effects of market competitiveness, the fading of brand differentiation and the ever-changing marketplace landscape. Transnationality and its impact on consumer behaviour—despite the increase in the international human movements and border crossing—is still an understudied field. The conducted literature review suggests that little attention has been paid to explore the link between boycotting and brand loyalty from the transnational consumers perspective. To achieve the research objective, which is to develop an understanding of the impact of boycotting on brand loyalty and the influence of transnationality on this relationship, a mixed methods approach was adopted. Thirty-five qualitative interviews were conducted with London-based Muslim Arabs and sequentially an online questionnaire that generated 537 responses. This research has empirically revealed the negative impact of consumer boycotts on brand loyalty and highlighted the influential role that transnationality, social capital and demographics play in shaping the consumer boycotting and brand loyalty decision-making process. This study also explored the role of religion on boycotting and the subsequent brand loyalty behaviour and empirically confirmed that religiously motivated boycotts are damaging for business firms as they have a sudden and long-term negative effect on loyalty. The study shows that religious denominations have a significant impact on both boycotting and loyalty behaviour.

These case studies are related by British colonial rule over two strategically vital parts of the empire. India and Egypt experienced nationalist struggles that brought full independence after World War II, and their leaders became prominent among newly independent nations and on the world stage. Britain influenced the education systems of India and Egypt as a colonial power, and influenced the production of textbooks. Tracing the process of creating mass education systems from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century in all three cases illustrates the process of initiating mass education that underlies the setting and use of textbooks as a technology of teaching. In Britain, the movement toward educating the masses arose with industrialization, and had expanded to cover primary and elementary education of most Britons by the end of the nineteenth century, after Britain’s industrial dominance had peaked. Secondary education only became widely available to the working classes during the twentieth century. In India, elites responded early to the stimulus of new forms of schooling, and demanded broader educational opportunities as a response to its status as a colony. Nationalists came to view mass education as a key to India’s development, and those who could do so embraced education as a path to careers in the colonial bureaucracy of the Raj after 1857. In Egypt, modernization began as a project of Ottoman governor Muhammad Ali, who enlisted elites into the project, and only gradually embraced wider segments of society in the education project. Mass education was a global development that represents the expanding role of the state and its embrace of the citizenry, reaching into their lives in previously unimagined ways. This dissertation adds to the field of textbook research, which has concentrated mainly on national history narratives, by analyzing how history and geography textbooks expressed a view of the world as a whole, and the nation’s place in the world past and present. Both decolonization and globalization make it important to see how the nation viewed the world and transmitted this worldview to its citizenry. Decolonization profoundly impacted the way in which the nation is understood in the context of the world as a whole. In this study two important newly independent nations worked out their identities and paths of development, while Britain came to terms with its diminished global role as it shed its colonies and transformed its place in the world. The study explores how, in the decades after World War II, these three different nations portrayed their own usable pasts in the context of the world’s heritage, and projected themselves forward into the modern world through economic and social development. The structure of mass education systems and the content conveyed to students exemplifies the deep intrusion of the modern nation into the minds of children and youth in service of asserting its identity and defining its place on the global stage.

Such projects have transformed rural livelihoods and environments, particularly via the dispossession of the lands, fields, and forests that Lao peasants rely upon for daily subsistence and cash income. While large-scale land acquisitions, or land grabs, across the Global South have been countered by social protest and movements in many countries, organized and vocal social mobilization is largely absent in Laos due to authoritarian state repression of dissident activity perceived to be anti-government. Lao peasants, however, have increasingly crafted politically creative methods of resistance that have enabled some communities and households to maintain access to land that had been allocated to investors. In this dissertation, I examine how effective resistance materializes within the Lao political landscape, by resisting with the state, shaping how industrial tree plantations are governed and their geographies of agrarian-environmental transformation. The overarching argument of the dissertation is that in authoritarian contexts, like Laos, peasants are able to maintain access to land by taking advantage of political relations among state, corporate, and community actors that provide politically feasible means of refusal. Peasants find ways to resist that tread a middle path, that do not challenge state hegemonic power nor engage in under-the-radar acts of everyday resistance. Instead, they exploit and refashion established lines and relations of power among communities, state agencies, and plantation managers. They resist within the bounds of state power. Political relations between resource companies and the state vary, affecting how state sovereignty is mobilized to dispossess peasants of their land. Communities targeted by companies with weak relations with the state are afforded greater opportunities to contest such projects as they are not developed with the heavy coercion afforded to companies with better state relations. Communities that have powerful political connections with the state are also in a better position to resist. They are able to more effectively lodge their claims with the state when they have the political links to do so, particularly ethnic and kinship ties developed during the Second Indochina War. Communities more effectively resist the acquisition of lands that are afforded greater value by the state, particularly lowland paddy rice fields and state conservation areas. Finally, internal community relations, particularly democratic decision-making and solidarity, shape how effectively they mobilize against unjust land dispossession. These arguments draw upon 20 months of in-country, ethnographic fieldwork during which I studied the operations of two plantation companies in 10 villages of Phin and Xepon districts, eastern Savannakhet province, southern Laos. One company is a state-owned Vietnamese rubber enterprise while the other is a private Chinese paper and pulp company planting eucalyptus and acacia trees. The bulk of the data comes from semi-structured one-on-one and focus group interviews with government officials at all administrative levels, civil society organizations, plantation company managers, village leaders, village households, and village women. The study is also deeply informed by participant observation – particularly with Lao government officials, civil society organizations, and rural communities – and by participatory mapping exercises and collected investment project documents. The dissertation makes novel contributions to the discipline of geography. First, I demonstrate the importance of contested political ethnography, a methodological approach through which immersion in uncomfortable and oppositional political situations provides insights that would otherwise go unnoticed. Second, I contribute to understandings of how nature-society transformations occur in under-studied, authoritarian political contexts where neoliberal reforms are integrated with a heavy-handed role of the state in the economy. Third, I theorize how resistance can materialize and be effective in such contexts, despite its heavy repression. Fourth, I contribute to understandings of how dispossession actually occurs in practice and is governed by varying political relationships, leading to geographically variegated agrarian-environmental transformations.",1860921162,,Dissertations & Theses," Kenney-Lazar, MilesKenney-LazarMilesKenney-Lazar, Miles", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4306639411 , 101597632 , 66569 , 9781369404852 , 10246657 , 10246657", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369404852, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1860921162?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0478 Forestry"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0478 Forestry"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0478 Forestry",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0366 Geography , 0478 Forestry"," Asian Studies , Geography , Forestry"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Dispossession , Environmental governance , Land grabbing , Laos , Resistance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Resisting+with+the+State%3A+The+Authoritarian+Governance+of+Land+in+Laos&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kenney-Lazar%2C+Miles&amp;isbn=9781369404852&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cosmopolitan medicine nationalized: The making of Japanese state-empire and overseas physicians in a global world,"My dissertation, “Cosmopolitan Medicine Nationalized: the Making of Japanese State-Empire and Overseas Physicians in a Global World,” examines the movement of Japanese physicians across Asia and the globe in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. By showing how doctors migrated to enhance their opportunities for career success, this study investigates the historical emergence of a cosmopolitan medical profession in Japan, its colonies, and other countries. At the same time, the globalization of the medical profession imposed a perplexing challenge to the sovereignty of modern states and empires, because licensing power and border control came to be regarded as essential components of modern state sovereignty in the early twentieth century. As self-proclaimed modern states, both Japan and the countries receiving Japanese physicians sought to impose more stringent regulations on foreign-trained doctors. I argue that this endeavor not only furthered the state’s control over both the medical profession and immigration, but also built an institutional infrastructure allowing for the evaluation of foreign diplomas and licenses. This eventually paved the way for the worldwide migration of medical workers from the second half of the twentieth century onward. Accordingly, this research elucidates a three-fold history: a national history of Japan’s modern state formation, an East Asian history of the Empire of Japan as a space of social mobility, and a world history of the development of physicians becoming state-sanctioned and yet internationally mobile professionals. My dissertation is organized chronologically and thematically in four parts. The first chapter investigates the evaluation of foreign-trained doctors in Meiji Japan and the countries receiving Japanese physicians, since it posed a problem for the local authorities and licensing system, as it was hard to determine whether a foreign certificate was real and the equivalent of their own. The second chapter explores how Korea and China, countries without any regulation of medical qualification, became lands of opportunity for Japanese practitioners who struggled within the increasingly competitive medical market at the turn of the twentieth century. Chapter three discusses how overseas Japanese physicians’ qualifications and capabilities were called into question when the rise of Japan as an imperial power caused great alarm to the receiving countries. The last chapter illustrates the gaps between the medical certification system in Japan and the sub-systems in Japan’s colonies. It also elucidates how the institutional discrepancies enabled colonial Taiwanese physicians to improve their inferior civic status and maximize chances for career advancement by moving to the empire’s other territories. I consider this research as not only a national history of Japan’s legitimation and demarcation of its state and empire but also an international history of the genesis of medicine as an internationally mobile profession.",1864781868,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, Wei-tiChenWei-tiChen, Wei-ti", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4311991701 , 111017262 , 66569 , 9781369438611 , 10239930 , 10239930", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369438611, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1864781868?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0585 Science history"," 0332 History , 0585 Science history"," 0332 History , 0585 Science history",," 0332 History , 0585 Science history"," History , Science history"," Social sciences , Colonial medicine , Japanese Empire , Medical migration , Medical profession , Professionalization , State formation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cosmopolitan+medicine+nationalized%3A+The+making+of+Japanese+state-empire+and+overseas+physicians+in+a+global+world&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Wei-ti&amp;isbn=9781369438611&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Mad Men, Playboys, and Hipsters: White Masculinity in Postwar U.S. Film and Literature","My dissertation examines the creation and resolution of crises in white masculinity in literature and film that maintain the universality of white masculinity in the U.S. Specifically, I am interested in how these crises are dictated by changes in the political position of people of color, women, and LGBT individuals, and the shifts in acceptable forms of labor and leisure in the postwar U.S. Beginning with narratives of neurasthenia and “battle stress” after the first World War, I engage with the rise of the middle-class, and with it, white collar labor and leisure activities during the Civil Rights Movement in the novels of Ernest Hemingway and Richard Wright. My first chapter considers Richard Wright’s “white” novel Savage Holiday against the “crisis of masculinity” and its attendant anxieties as presented in men’s and women’s magazines and the suburban novel. Savage Holiday has been ignored by scholars and considered by many to be Wright’s only novel to avoid dealing with race. I would contend, however, that Savage Holiday allows Wright to consider whiteness as a racial category instead of a universal identity, unveiling and dissecting white privilege. In Chapter Two, I examine Hemingway’s African texts, and these works’ relationship to the growing racial and gendered unrest in the United States, even as Hemingway sets his texts exclusively in Africa and spent most of his later life in Africa and Cuba. These works illuminate Hemingway’s increasingly fluid conceptions of whiteness and masculinity, even as he struggles to create a universal African identity for himself that transcends whiteness. My work on Hemingway’s African texts and Savage Holiday contributes not just to existing scholarship concerning Wright and Hemingway’s bodies of work but will also shed light on the troubled relationships to whiteness and masculinity both struggled with in their later works. Additionally, while whiteness studies has consistently ignored or erased the role of white-collar labor from its analysis of white privilege, my work with these mostly dismissed novels by major authors makes the connection between whiteness and the postwar masculinity crisis explicit. The second half of my project moves to the period following the Civil Rights Movement to examine the evolution of white hipster identity from Jack Kerouac to the films Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and The Comedy , and Jonathan Lethem’s novel, The Fortress of Solitude . These versions of superficially non-conformist white masculinity strive to perform whiteness as a cultural traveler and appropriator that performs any combination of non-white cultures and inhabits those culturally defined spaces more “authentically” than non-white subjects. Whiteness in the hands of hipsters is an odd form of appropriation that does not mark a “theft” of minority cultural objects by dominant culture, but rather the marketing of aspects of dominant culture (in this case, white suburbia) as something so absurd and so uncool that it begins to take on an exotic quality of difference. I end with a look at the 2007-2015 television series, Mad Men . The series ran during what many have termed the “Third Golden Age of TV” and what I am calling the “Anti-Hero Golden Age.” While prestige television in this period revolved exclusively around the figure of the anti-hero (almost always white and male) in response to the rise of the alt-right and the Global War on Terror, Mad Men diverted the narrative away from a celebration of the anti-social, anti-government hero, to a meditation on the legacies of the 60s counterculture and its backlash.",1872341297,,Dissertations & Theses," Shaw, Danielle NicoleShawNicoleDanielleShaw, Danielle Nicole", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317333691 , 105730462 , 66569 , 9781369616262 , 10244417 , 10244417", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369616262, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872341297?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies",," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies"," American studies , American literature , Gender studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Blackness , Film/television , Hemingway, Ernest , Masculinity , Whiteness , Wright, Richard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mad+Men%2C+Playboys%2C+and+Hipsters%3A+White+Masculinity+in+Postwar+U.S.+Film+and+Literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shaw%2C+Danielle+Nicole&amp;isbn=9781369616262&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Bordering Faith: spiritual transformation, cultural change, and Chicana/o youth at the border","For several decades now, ethnographers, historians, and religious scholars alike have explored charismatic forms of Christianity among Mexican American or Chicana/o youth, chiefly in southern California, because this social group now represents the fastest growing segment of U.S. Pentecostalism (Lugo et al. 2007; Hackett 2015). In this relatively short period of time, researchers have almost exclusively concentrated their studies on congregational experiences, paying little attention to the religious expressions of these youth between Sundays. Furthermore, no study has examined the cultural practices of religious youth in predominantly Chicana/o communities or how such youth are exposed to and even draw from other cultures to pump life into the global charismatic and Pentecostal movement. In order to shed light on the untold experiences of such youth beyond church walls, this study ventures into a Chicana/o majority community alongside the U.S. border with Mexico to find out more about the implications of religious assimilation, or how these youths internalize Pentecostalism, and how socio-economic elements influence this process. The study utilizes field research, cultural archives, participant-observation, a survey instrument, and interviews to document and explore the cultural implications that stem from this popular form of assimilation presented in three case studies. In doing so, the study describes how religious assimilation happens in aggrieved communities of color and suggests Pentecostal assimilation is an increasingly popular life path by which individuals and groups in a Chicana/o majority community are transforming the long history of mestizo/indigenous independence through innovations and disruptions in dominant culture in order to create new spaces of belonging that disrupt cultural representations of the brown body and brown soul. In the end, this dissertation gives impetus to an ongoing exercise in Chicana/o Studies for understanding and interpreting the development of an expanding evangelical Chicana/o experience that is challenging traditional religious practices and related paradigms used to interpret the Chicana/o experience in the twenty-first century.",1876556003,,Dissertations & Theses," Fuentes, Francisco Javier, Jr.FuentesJavierFranciscoJr.Fuentes, Francisco Javier, Jr.", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4320402001 , 104603912 , 66569 , 9781369575743 , 10194187 , 10194187", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369575743, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1876556003?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Religion , Sociology , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Border studies , Evangelicalism , Identity formation , Latino studies , Pentecostal studies , Subcultures",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bordering+Faith%3A+spiritual+transformation%2C+cultural+change%2C+and+Chicana%2Fo+youth+at+the+border&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fuentes%2C+Francisco+Javier%2C+Jr.&amp;isbn=9781369575743&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""South africa's female comrades: gender, identity, and student resistance to apartheid in soweto, 1984-1994","As South Africa’s struggle against apartheid entered its final, turbulent decade, African students and youth rose to the forefront of the liberation movement, engaging in non-violent protest and militant confrontation with the apartheid state. In the existing historiography, the “comrades” – as young activists were known – are predominantly depicted as male, with little attention paid to the experiences of politicised girls and young women. This thesis is the first extensive study of South Africa’s female comrades, focused on activists from the township of Soweto. In analysing the experiences of young female activists, it introduces their voices into male-dominated historical narratives, and complicates and challenges existing histories of gender, generation, identity, and political violence in late-apartheid South Africa. Drawing on oral history interviews with former comrades, the thesis provides new insight into why girls joined the struggle, what roles they played, how they were treated by their male comrades, and their experiences of political detention. It argues that the struggle, despite being a male-dominated arena, could provide girls with a sense of agency and empowerment at a time when girls’ lives were otherwise marked by their confinement to the private sphere, social subordination, and susceptibility to sexual violence. Thus, just as the struggle offered young men a means of asserting their masculinity, so too did it offer young women a means of challenging emphasised femininities and constructing oppositional gender identities that defied social expectations and limitations of traditional girlhood. Additionally, this thesis improves current understandings of girls’ experiences of conflict on a global scale by challenging widely held assumptions of girls’ predisposition to peaceful behaviour and lack of political agency. In so doing it places Soweto’s female comrades within broader narratives of liberation movements across Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere. This thesis thus makes an important and original contribution not just to South African history, but also to histories of nationalism and liberation movements, feminist conflict studies, and girlhood studies.",1896109244,,Dissertations & Theses," Bridger, Emily JessicaBridgerJessicaEmilyBridger, Emily Jessica", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322235033 , 105094812 , 101309 , 10595977 , 10595977 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/24653", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896109244?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/24653 , (UMI)AAI10595977 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=South+africa%27s+female+comrades%3A+gender%2C+identity%2C+and+student+resistance+to+apartheid+in+soweto%2C+1984-1994&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bridger%2C+Emily+Jessica&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"
